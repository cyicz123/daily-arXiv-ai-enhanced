Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: BR-TaxQA-R是一个支持巴西个人所得税法问答的新数据集，包含715个问题，采用RAG方法，结果显示其优于商业系统，但需专家验证法律有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为巴西个人所得税法提供问答支持，结合法律条文和行政裁决，提升AI在法律领域的实用性。

Method: 使用OpenAI嵌入和GPT-4o-mini构建RAG管道，比较不同文本分割策略，并基于RAGAS指标评估性能。

Result: 自定义RAG管道在响应相关性上优于商业系统，但商业模型在事实准确性和流畅性上表现更好。

Conclusion: 在法律领域，AI生成答案需结合专家验证以确保有效性，BR-TaxQA-R数据集已公开。

Abstract: This paper presents BR-TaxQA-R, a novel dataset designed to support question
answering with references in the context of Brazilian personal income tax law.
The dataset contains 715 questions from the 2024 official Q\&A document
published by Brazil's Internal Revenue Service, enriched with statutory norms
and administrative rulings from the Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais
(CARF). We implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using
OpenAI embeddings for searching and GPT-4o-mini for answer generation. We
compare different text segmentation strategies and benchmark our system against
commercial tools such as ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai using RAGAS-based metrics.
Results show that our custom RAG pipeline outperforms commercial systems in
Response Relevancy, indicating stronger alignment with user queries, while
commercial models achieve higher scores in Factual Correctness and fluency.
These findings highlight a trade-off between legally grounded generation and
linguistic fluency. Crucially, we argue that human expert evaluation remains
essential to ensure the legal validity of AI-generated answers in high-stakes
domains such as taxation. BR-TaxQA-R is publicly available at

### [2] [Extracting Probabilistic Knowledge from Large Language Models for Bayesian Network Parameterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15918)
*Aliakbar Nafar,Kristen Brent Venable,Zijun Cui,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文研究了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）提取概率知识以构建贝叶斯网络（BNs），并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs作为事实知识库的潜力已被证实，但其在生成关于现实世界事件的概率知识方面的能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过查询LLMs获取事件的概率参数，用于构建贝叶斯网络，并与随机、均匀分布等基线方法进行比较。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs提供的概率估计在多个领域（如医疗和金融）中具有实际意义，并能减少系统性偏差。

Conclusion: LLMs提取的概率知识可用于自动构建贝叶斯网络，并结合少量真实数据优化模型，为概率知识提取提供了新基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as factual knowledge
bases; however, their capability to generate probabilistic knowledge about
real-world events remains understudied. This paper investigates using
probabilistic knowledge inherent in LLMs to derive probability estimates for
statements concerning events and their interrelationships captured via a
Bayesian Network (BN). Using LLMs in this context allows for the
parameterization of BNs, enabling probabilistic modeling within specific
domains. Experiments on eighty publicly available Bayesian Networks, from
healthcare to finance, demonstrate that querying LLMs about the conditional
probabilities of events provides meaningful results when compared to baselines,
including random and uniform distributions, as well as approaches based on
next-token generation probabilities. We explore how these LLM-derived
distributions can serve as expert priors to refine distributions extracted from
minimal data, significantly reducing systematic biases. Overall, this work
introduces a promising strategy for automatically constructing Bayesian
Networks by combining probabilistic knowledge extracted from LLMs with small
amounts of real-world data. Additionally, we evaluate several prompting
strategies for eliciting probabilistic knowledge from LLMs and establish the
first comprehensive baseline for assessing LLM performance in extracting
probabilistic knowledge.

### [3] [Aligning Dialogue Agents with Global Feedback via Large Language Model Reward Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15922)
*Dong Won Lee,Hae Won Park,Cynthia Breazeal,Louis-Philippe Morency*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的奖励分解框架，通过单次会话级反馈信号对齐对话代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法需要手动奖励塑造和细粒度人类反馈的问题，利用预训练大语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 通过分解全局会话级反馈推断细粒度局部奖励，包括纯文本和多模态变体，后者结合行为线索。

Result: 在对话质量的人类评估中优于现有奖励分解方法。

Conclusion: 大语言模型是强大的奖励分解器，无需手动奖励塑造或细粒度人类反馈。

Abstract: We propose a large language model based reward decomposition framework for
aligning dialogue agents using only a single session-level feedback signal. We
leverage the reasoning capabilities of a frozen, pretrained large language
model (LLM) to infer fine-grained local implicit rewards by decomposing global,
session-level feedback. Our first text-only variant prompts the LLM to perform
reward decomposition using only the dialogue transcript. The second multimodal
variant incorporates additional behavioral cues, such as pitch, gaze, and
facial affect, expressed as natural language descriptions. These inferred
turn-level rewards are distilled into a lightweight reward model, which we
utilize for RL-based fine-tuning for dialogue generation. We evaluate both
text-only and multimodal variants against state-of-the-art reward decomposition
methods and demonstrate notable improvements in human evaluations of
conversation quality, suggesting that LLMs are strong reward decomposers that
obviate the need for manual reward shaping and granular human feedback.

### [4] [Citation Parsing and Analysis with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15948)
*Parth Sarin,Juan Pablo Alperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于开源语言模型的工具，用于解析和标记文献引用，以改善全球知识共享网络的不平等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球知识生产和传播中的不平等问题，尤其是全球南方学者在索引服务中的边缘化现象。

Method: 使用开源语言模型对文献引用进行标记，构建数据集并评估模型性能。

Result: 现有语言模型在引用解析任务中表现出色，尤其是小模型Qwen3-0.6B在少量迭代中即可高精度完成任务。

Conclusion: 该工具可显著提升引用网络的准确性，改善研究索引和发现，并推动元科学研究。

Abstract: A key type of resource needed to address global inequalities in knowledge
production and dissemination is a tool that can support journals in
understanding how knowledge circulates. The absence of such a tool has resulted
in comparatively less information about networks of knowledge sharing in the
Global South. In turn, this gap authorizes the exclusion of researchers and
scholars from the South in indexing services, reinforcing colonial arrangements
that de-center and minoritize those scholars. In order to support citation
network tracking on a global scale, we investigate the capacity of open-weight
language models to mark up manuscript citations in an indexable format. We
assembled a dataset of matched plaintext and annotated citations from preprints
and published research papers. Then, we evaluated a number of open-weight
language models on the annotation task. We find that, even out of the box,
today's language models achieve high levels of accuracy on identifying the
constituent components of each citation, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, the smallest model we evaluated, Qwen3-0.6B, can parse all
fields with high accuracy in $2^5$ passes, suggesting that post-training is
likely to be effective in producing small, robust citation parsing models. Such
a tool could greatly improve the fidelity of citation networks and thus
meaningfully improve research indexing and discovery, as well as further
metascientific research.

### [5] [Training Step-Level Reasoning Verifiers with Formal Verification Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15960)
*Ryo Kamoi,Yusen Zhang,Nan Zhang,Sarkar Snigdha Sarathi Das,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出FoVer方法，利用形式化验证工具自动标注步骤级错误标签，训练过程奖励模型（PRMs），解决了人工标注成本高和任务泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRMs依赖昂贵的人工标注且仅适用于数学推理任务，需解决自动数据集创建和任务泛化问题。

Method: 使用形式化验证工具（如Z3和Isabelle）自动标注步骤级错误标签，合成训练数据集，训练PRMs。

Result: FoVer训练的PRMs在多样推理任务中表现优异，优于基线PRMs，并与人工标注的先进PRMs竞争。

Conclusion: FoVer为PRMs提供高效自动标注方法，显著提升跨任务泛化能力，适用于形式化验证兼容任务。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs), which provide step-by-step feedback on the
reasoning generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), are receiving increasing
attention. However, two key research gaps remain: collecting accurate
step-level error labels for training typically requires costly human
annotation, and existing PRMs are limited to math reasoning problems. In
response to these gaps, this paper aims to address the challenges of automatic
dataset creation and the generalization of PRMs to diverse reasoning tasks. To
achieve this goal, we propose FoVer, an approach for training PRMs on
step-level error labels automatically annotated by formal verification tools,
such as Z3 for formal logic and Isabelle for theorem proof, which provide
automatic and accurate verification for symbolic tasks. Using this approach, we
synthesize a training dataset with error labels on LLM responses for formal
logic and theorem proof tasks without human annotation. Although this data
synthesis is feasible only for tasks compatible with formal verification, we
observe that LLM-based PRMs trained on our dataset exhibit cross-task
generalization, improving verification across diverse reasoning tasks.
Specifically, PRMs trained with FoVer significantly outperform baseline PRMs
based on the original LLMs and achieve competitive or superior results compared
to state-of-the-art PRMs trained on labels annotated by humans or stronger
models, as measured by step-level verification on ProcessBench and Best-of-K
performance across 12 reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME, ANLI, MMLU,
and BBH. The datasets, models, and code are provided at
https://github.com/psunlpgroup/FoVer.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种新型语言模型LMLM，将事实知识存储在内部权重和外部数据库中，减少对记忆的依赖，实现可编辑和可验证的知识管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经语言模型中知识分布不透明、难以检查和更新的问题。

Method: 通过预训练策略，将事实知识存储在内部权重和外部数据库中，并屏蔽外部检索的事实值以减少记忆依赖。

Result: LMLM在标准基准测试中表现与更大规模的知识密集模型相当，同时具备显式、可编辑和可验证的知识库优势。

Conclusion: LMLM代表了语言模型与事实知识交互和管理方式的根本性转变。

Abstract: Neural language models are black-boxes -- both linguistic patterns and
factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This
entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update
specific facts. We propose a new class of language models, Large Memory
Language Models (LMLM) with a pre-training recipe that stores factual knowledge
in both internal weights and an external database. Our approach strategically
masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby
teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on
memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve
competitive performance compared to significantly larger, knowledge-dense LLMs
on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable,
and verifiable knowledge bases. This work represents a fundamental shift in how
language models interact with and manage factual knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究评估了五种大型语言模型（LLMs）在解决和解释数独谜题中的表现，发现其解释能力不足，难以支持人机协作决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在提供可信、渐进和定制化解释方面的能力，以支持人机协作决策。

Method: 评估五种LLMs在解决和解释数独谜题中的表现。

Result: 仅一种LLM能有限解决谜题，但所有模型均无法提供反映战略推理或直观问题解决的解释。

Conclusion: LLMs在成为有效人机协作决策伙伴前，需解决解释能力不足的挑战。

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in human-AI collaborative
decision-making hinges on their ability to provide trustworthy, gradual, and
tailored explanations. Solving complex puzzles, such as Sudoku, offers a
canonical example of this collaboration, where clear and customized
explanations often hold greater importance than the final solution. In this
study, we evaluate the performance of five LLMs in solving and explaining
\sixsix{} Sudoku puzzles. While one LLM demonstrates limited success in solving
puzzles, none can explain the solution process in a manner that reflects
strategic reasoning or intuitive problem-solving. These findings underscore
significant challenges that must be addressed before LLMs can become effective
partners in human-AI collaborative decision-making.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究通过爬取波斯语医学杂志和医患问答数据，增强小型语言模型的医学知识，提升了其在波斯语医学问答中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语等低资源语言的小型语言模型在医学领域表现不佳，缺乏专门的数据集。

Method: 利用爬取的医学杂志和医患问答数据集，对基线模型进行微调。

Result: 微调后的模型在医学问答中表现更优，准确性提高。

Conclusion: 开放数据可用于增强小型语言模型的医学知识，为资源受限环境提供解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of language models has demonstrated the potential of
artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. However, small language
models struggle with specialized domains in low-resource languages like
Persian. While numerous medical-domain websites exist in Persian, no curated
dataset or corpus has been available making ours the first of its kind. This
study explores the enhancement of medical knowledge in a small language model
by leveraging accessible online data, including a crawled corpus from medical
magazines and a dataset of real doctor-patient QA pairs. We fine-tuned a
baseline model using our curated data to improve its medical knowledge.
Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves improved
accuracy in medical question answering and provides better responses compared
to its baseline. This work highlights the potential of leveraging open-access
online data to enrich small language models in medical fields, providing a
novel solution for Persian medical AI applications suitable for
resource-constrained environments.

### [9] [Causal Interventions Reveal Shared Structure Across English Filler-Gap Constructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16002)
*Sasha Boguraev,Christopher Potts,Kyle Mahowald*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了如何利用因果可解释性方法分析大型语言模型（LLMs），以增强其对语言学理论的贡献，特别是英语填充-空缺依赖结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过分析LLMs的内部机制，揭示其学习抽象语法结构的方式，从而推动语言学理论的发展。

Method: 采用分布式交换干预实验方法，分析LLMs对填充-空缺依赖结构的处理。

Result: LLMs对这些结构表现出相似的抽象分析，并揭示了频率、填充类型和上下文等被忽视的因素。

Conclusion: LLMs的内部机制分析有助于推动语言学理论的进步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful sources of evidence for
linguists seeking to develop theories of syntax. In this paper, we argue that
causal interpretability methods, applied to LLMs, can greatly enhance the value
of such evidence by helping us characterize the abstract mechanisms that LLMs
learn to use. Our empirical focus is a set of English filler-gap dependency
constructions (e.g., questions, relative clauses). Linguistic theories largely
agree that these constructions share many properties. Using experiments based
in Distributed Interchange Interventions, we show that LLMs converge on similar
abstract analyses of these constructions. These analyses also reveal previously
overlooked factors -- relating to frequency, filler type, and surrounding
context -- that could motivate changes to standard linguistic theory. Overall,
these results suggest that mechanistic, internal analyses of LLMs can push
linguistic theory forward.

### [10] [SLMEval: Entropy-Based Calibration for Human-Aligned Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16003)
*Roland Daynauth,Christopher Clarke,Krisztian Flautner,Lingjia Tang,Jason Mars*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: SLMEval是一种基于熵最大化的校准方法，显著提升了语言模型评估与人类判断的相关性，并在实际任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有校准方法在开放任务中表现不佳，与人类判断相关性弱甚至负相关，需要一种更通用的校准方法。

Method: 提出SLMEval，基于少量人类偏好数据，通过熵最大化估计模型质量分布并重新加权评分。

Result: SLMEval在实际任务和公共基准测试中与人类判断相关性显著提升（如Spearman相关0.57），且成本降低5-30倍。

Conclusion: SLMEval是一种高效且通用的校准方法，适用于开放任务，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm offers a scalable, reference-free approach for
evaluating language models. Although several calibration techniques have been
proposed to better align these evaluators with human judgment, prior studies
focus primarily on narrow, well-structured benchmarks. As a result, it remains
unclear whether such calibrations generalize to real-world, open-ended tasks.
  In this work, we show that SOTA calibrated evaluators often fail in these
settings, exhibiting weak or even negative correlation with human judgments. To
address this, we propose SLMEval, a novel and efficient calibration method
based on entropy maximization over a small amount of human preference data. By
estimating a latent distribution over model quality and reweighting evaluator
scores accordingly, SLMEval achieves strong correlation with human evaluations
across two real-world production use cases and the public benchmark. For
example, on one such task, SLMEval achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.57 with
human judgments, while G-Eval yields a negative correlation. In addition,
SLMEval reduces evaluation costs by 5-30x compared to GPT-4-based calibrated
evaluators such as G-eval.

*Wenrui Yu,Yiyi Chen,Johannes Bjerva,Sokol Kosta,Qiongxiu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: LAGO是一种基于语言相似性的图优化方法，用于少样本跨语言嵌入反转攻击，显著提升攻击的迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言NLP系统中的隐私漏洞，通过建模语言关系改进嵌入反转攻击的效果。

Method: 利用图约束分布式优化框架，结合句法和词汇相似性作为边约束，实现跨语言参数协作学习。

Result: 实验显示LAGO在Rouge-L分数上比基线提高10-20%，验证了语言相似性对攻击迁移性的重要性。

Conclusion: 语言相似性是跨语言嵌入反转攻击的关键因素，需重视语言感知的隐私保护嵌入方法。

Abstract: We propose LAGO - Language Similarity-Aware Graph Optimization - a novel
approach for few-shot cross-lingual embedding inversion attacks, addressing
critical privacy vulnerabilities in multilingual NLP systems. Unlike prior work
in embedding inversion attacks that treat languages independently, LAGO
explicitly models linguistic relationships through a graph-based constrained
distributed optimization framework. By integrating syntactic and lexical
similarity as edge constraints, our method enables collaborative parameter
learning across related languages. Theoretically, we show this formulation
generalizes prior approaches, such as ALGEN, which emerges as a special case
when similarity constraints are relaxed. Our framework uniquely combines
Frobenius-norm regularization with linear inequality or total variation
constraints, ensuring robust alignment of cross-lingual embedding spaces even
with extremely limited data (as few as 10 samples per language). Extensive
experiments across multiple languages and embedding models demonstrate that
LAGO substantially improves the transferability of attacks with 10-20% increase
in Rouge-L score over baselines. This work establishes language similarity as a
critical factor in inversion attack transferability, urging renewed focus on
language-aware privacy-preserving multilingual embeddings.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: METEORA提出了一种新的RAG方法，通过基于理由的选择替代传统的重排序，提高了生成准确性、解释性和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法依赖相似性检索和启发式重排序，缺乏解释性和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: METEORA分两阶段：1）LLM生成基于查询的理由；2）理由驱动的证据块选择（局部相关性、全局选择和上下文扩展）。

Result: 在六个数据集中，METEORA生成准确性提高33.34%，使用块数减少50%，对抗攻击下F1分数从0.10提升至0.44。

Conclusion: METEORA通过理由驱动的选择显著提升了RAG的解释性、准确性和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on
similarity-based retrieval and re-ranking, which depend on heuristics such as
top-k, and lack explainability, interpretability, and robustness against
adversarial content. To address this gap, we propose a novel method METEORA
that replaces re-ranking in RAG with a rationale-driven selection approach.
METEORA operates in two stages. First, a general-purpose LLM is
preference-tuned to generate rationales conditioned on the input query using
direct preference optimization. These rationales guide the evidence chunk
selection engine, which selects relevant chunks in three stages: pairing
individual rationales with corresponding retrieved chunks for local relevance,
global selection with elbow detection for adaptive cutoff, and context
expansion via neighboring chunks. This process eliminates the need for top-k
heuristics. The rationales are also used for consistency check using a Verifier
LLM to detect and filter poisoned or misleading content for safe generation.
The framework provides explainable and interpretable evidence flow by using
rationales consistently across both selection and verification. Our evaluation
across six datasets spanning legal, financial, and academic research domains
shows that METEORA improves generation accuracy by 33.34% while using
approximately 50% fewer chunks than state-of-the-art re-ranking methods. In
adversarial settings, METEORA significantly improves the F1 score from 0.10 to
0.44 over the state-of-the-art perplexity-based defense baseline, demonstrating
strong resilience to poisoning attacks. Code available at:

*Wei Liu,Siya Qi,Xinyu Wang,Chen Qian,Yali Du,Yulan He*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: NOVER是一种无需外部验证器的强化学习框架，仅需标准监督微调数据，适用于广泛的文本任务，性能优于同类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激励训练方法依赖外部验证器，限制了其应用范围，且验证器训练成本高。

Method: 提出NOVER框架，无需外部验证器，仅需标准监督微调数据。

Result: NOVER在文本任务中表现优于同类模型，性能提升7.7%。

Conclusion: NOVER为优化大语言模型提供了新可能性，如逆向激励训练。

Abstract: Recent advances such as DeepSeek R1-Zero highlight the effectiveness of
incentive training, a reinforcement learning paradigm that computes rewards
solely based on the final answer part of a language model's output, thereby
encouraging the generation of intermediate reasoning steps. However, these
methods fundamentally rely on external verifiers, which limits their
applicability to domains like mathematics and coding where such verifiers are
readily available. Although reward models can serve as verifiers, they require
high-quality annotated data and are costly to train. In this work, we propose
NOVER, NO-VERifier Reinforcement Learning, a general reinforcement learning
framework that requires only standard supervised fine-tuning data with no need
for an external verifier. NOVER enables incentive training across a wide range
of text-to-text tasks and outperforms the model of the same size distilled from
large reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 671B by 7.7 percent. Moreover, the
flexibility of NOVER enables new possibilities for optimizing large language
models, such as inverse incentive training.

*Sheshera Mysore,Debarati Das,Hancheng Cao,Bahareh Sarrafzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文研究了用户与大型语言模型（LLM）在写作任务中的多轮协作行为，提出了典型的人机协作行为（PATHs），并探讨了其对LLM对齐的启示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在复杂写作流程中的应用，用户通过多轮交互优化生成内容，但现有研究缺乏对交互行为的深入分析。

Method: 通过分析Bing Copilot和WildChat用户的实际写作任务数据，识别出典型的协作行为（PATHs），并统计其与写作意图的关联。

Result: 发现少数PATHs能解释大部分用户-LLM交互行为，且特定写作意图与PATHs显著相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果对LLM对齐设计有重要启示，强调了理解用户意图和协作行为的重要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are used in complex writing workflows, users
engage in multi-turn interactions to steer generations to better fit their
needs. Rather than passively accepting output, users actively refine, explore,
and co-construct text. We conduct a large-scale analysis of this collaborative
behavior for users engaged in writing tasks in the wild with two popular AI
assistants, Bing Copilot and WildChat. Our analysis goes beyond simple task
classification or satisfaction estimation common in prior work and instead
characterizes how users interact with LLMs through the course of a session. We
identify prototypical behaviors in how users interact with LLMs in prompts
following their original request. We refer to these as Prototypical Human-AI
Collaboration Behaviors (PATHs) and find that a small group of PATHs explain a
majority of the variation seen in user-LLM interaction. These PATHs span users
revising intents, exploring texts, posing questions, adjusting style or
injecting new content. Next, we find statistically significant correlations
between specific writing intents and PATHs, revealing how users' intents shape
their collaboration behaviors. We conclude by discussing the implications of
our findings on LLM alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在伦理维度和语言多样性上存在局限，需更全面的伦理评估以指导模型开发。

Method: 采用新颖数据收集方法，评估模型在英语和土耳其语中的行为，使用LLM-as-a-Judge进行分析。

Result: 开源模型在安全性和公平性上表现较好，鲁棒性良好，但可靠性仍需改进。大参数模型（如Gemma和Qwen）伦理表现更优。

Conclusion: 伦理评估可独立于语言进行，大参数模型表现更佳，为未来模型开发提供了指导。

Abstract: Generative large language models present significant potential but also raise
critical ethical concerns. Most studies focus on narrow ethical dimensions, and
also limited diversity of languages and models. To address these gaps, we
conduct a broad ethical evaluation of 29 recent open-source large language
models using a novel data collection including four ethical aspects:
Robustness, reliability, safety, and fairness. We analyze model behavior in
both a commonly used language, English, and a low-resource language, Turkish.
Our aim is to provide a comprehensive ethical assessment and guide safer model
development by filling existing gaps in evaluation breadth, language coverage,
and model diversity. Our experimental results, based on LLM-as-a-Judge, reveal
that optimization efforts for many open-source models appear to have
prioritized safety and fairness, and demonstrated good robustness while
reliability remains a concern. We demonstrate that ethical evaluation can be
effectively conducted independently of the language used. In addition, models
with larger parameter counts tend to exhibit better ethical performance, with
Gemma and Qwen models demonstrating the most ethical behavior among those
evaluated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究NLP领域内外部影响的差异，揭示学术研究与实际应用的关联。

Method: 通过分析论文引用及专利、媒体和政策文件等外部数据，评估NLP主题的影响。

Result: 语言模型影响最广，伦理话题在政策文件中受关注但学术引用少，不同外部领域偏好各异。

Conclusion: NLP研究的内外部影响总体一致，但伦理等话题在政策层面更受重视，应用领域偏好不同。

Abstract: We investigate the impacts of NLP research published in top-tier conferences
(i.e., ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL) from 1979 to 2024. By analyzing citations from
research articles and external sources such as patents, media, and policy
documents, we examine how different NLP topics are consumed both within the
academic community and by the broader public. Our findings reveal that language
modeling has the widest internal and external influence, while linguistic
foundations have lower impacts. We also observe that internal and external
impacts generally align, but topics like ethics, bias, and fairness show
significant attention in policy documents with much fewer academic citations.
Additionally, external domains exhibit distinct preferences, with patents
focusing on practical NLP applications and media and policy documents engaging
more with the societal implications of NLP models.

TLDR: 本文探讨了小型语言模型在文本分类任务中的潜力，通过评估提示工程和监督微调方法，为工业场景中的本地部署提供实用建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT等Transformer模型的兴起，尽管性能强大，但其推理效率低、依赖高质量提示且资源需求高，促使研究小型模型在文本分类中的可行性。

Method: 综合评估了提示工程和监督微调方法，聚焦于工业场景（如邮件分类、法律文件分类和长文本分类），并分析小型模型的性能与VRAM效率。

Result: 研究发现小型模型在特定任务中表现良好，且资源效率更高，适合本地部署。

Conclusion: 小型模型在文本分类任务中具有实际应用潜力，尤其在资源受限的工业场景中表现突出。

Abstract: With the emergence of ChatGPT, Transformer models have significantly advanced
text classification and related tasks. Decoder-only models such as Llama
exhibit strong performance and flexibility, yet they suffer from inefficiency
on inference due to token-by-token generation, and their effectiveness in text
classification tasks heavily depends on prompt quality. Moreover, their
substantial GPU resource requirements often limit widespread adoption. Thus,
the question of whether smaller language models are capable of effectively
handling text classification tasks emerges as a topic of significant interest.
However, the selection of appropriate models and methodologies remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of prompt
engineering and supervised fine-tuning methods for transformer-based text
classification. Specifically, we focus on practical industrial scenarios,
including email classification, legal document categorization, and the
classification of extremely long academic texts. We examine the strengths and
limitations of smaller models, with particular attention to both their
performance and their efficiency in Video Random-Access Memory (VRAM)
utilization, thereby providing valuable insights for the local deployment and
application of compact models in industrial settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: BiasLab是一个包含300篇政治新闻文章的数据集，标注了感知到的意识形态偏见。文章选自900篇涵盖不同政治事件和来源偏见的文档，通过众包标注情感倾向和理由指示。数据集支持偏见检测的解释性建模，并发布了数据集、标注方案和建模代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够解释政治偏见的数据集，支持透明和社会意识强的NLP系统。

Method: 从900篇文档中选取300篇，通过众包标注情感倾向和理由，优化标注流程，并量化标注一致性。同时使用GPT-4o模拟标注，与人类标注对比。

Result: 数据集展示了标注一致性，揭示了GPT-4o与人类标注的差异，尤其是在右倾内容的误分类上。定义了两种建模任务并提供了基线性能。

Conclusion: BiasLab通过丰富的理由标注支持解释性偏见建模，促进透明NLP系统的开发，并鼓励研究人机交互解释性。

Abstract: We present BiasLab, a dataset of 300 political news articles annotated for
perceived ideological bias. These articles were selected from a curated
900-document pool covering diverse political events and source biases. Each
article is labeled by crowdworkers along two independent scales, assessing
sentiment toward the Democratic and Republican parties, and enriched with
rationale indicators. The annotation pipeline incorporates targeted worker
qualification and was refined through pilot-phase analysis. We quantify
inter-annotator agreement, analyze misalignment with source-level outlet bias,
and organize the resulting labels into interpretable subsets. Additionally, we
simulate annotation using schema-constrained GPT-4o, enabling direct comparison
to human labels and revealing mirrored asymmetries, especially in
misclassifying subtly right-leaning content. We define two modeling tasks:
perception drift prediction and rationale type classification, and report
baseline performance to illustrate the challenge of explainable bias detection.
BiasLab's rich rationale annotations provide actionable interpretations that
facilitate explainable modeling of political bias, supporting the development
of transparent, socially aware NLP systems. We release the dataset, annotation
schema, and modeling code to encourage research on human-in-the-loop
interpretability and the evaluation of explanation effectiveness in real-world
settings.

*Gagan Bhatia,Maxime Peyrard,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种衡量BPE分词器对日期分割效果的指标DateAugBench，并通过实验发现过度分割会影响模型对不常见日期的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代BPE分词器会将日期分割成无意义的片段，影响时间推理的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入日期分割比率指标，发布DateAugBench测试集，并通过层间探测和注意力分析研究模型行为。

Result: 过度分割导致不常见日期准确率下降10%，大模型能更快修复分割片段。

Conclusion: 模型通过不同于人类的路径（年→月→日）组装日期片段，大模型修复能力更强。

Abstract: Modern BPE tokenizers often split calendar dates into meaningless fragments,
e.g., 20250312 $\rightarrow$ 202, 503, 12, inflating token counts and obscuring
the inherent structure needed for robust temporal reasoning. In this work, we
(1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation
ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date
components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three
temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance
puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future
regimes; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses,
uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models
stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal
reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with
accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and
futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the
emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we
observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically
differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$
day).

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文介绍了bRAGgen，一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的自适应模型，用于解决减肥和代谢手术（MBS）中患者获取信息的障碍，并通过bRAGq数据集验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减肥和代谢手术（MBS）的治疗效果依赖于多学科团队的长期参与，但医疗资源不均等问题阻碍了患者获取及时、准确的信息。

Method: 提出bRAGgen模型，动态整合实时医学证据，并引入bRAGq数据集（1,302个问题）作为评估基准。

Result: bRAGgen在生成临床准确和相关响应方面显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: bRAGgen为MBS领域提供了高效、准确的信息支持工具，有望改善患者护理质量。

Abstract: While bariatric and metabolic surgery (MBS) is considered the gold standard
treatment for severe and morbid obesity, its therapeutic efficacy hinges upon
active and longitudinal engagement with multidisciplinary providers, including
surgeons, dietitians/nutritionists, psychologists, and endocrinologists. This
engagement spans the entire patient journey, from preoperative preparation to
long-term postoperative management. However, this process is often hindered by
numerous healthcare disparities, such as logistical and access barriers, which
impair easy patient access to timely, evidence-based, clinician-endorsed
information. To address these gaps, we introduce bRAGgen, a novel adaptive
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based model that autonomously integrates
real-time medical evidence when response confidence dips below dynamic
thresholds. This self-updating architecture ensures that responses remain
current and accurate, reducing the risk of misinformation. Additionally, we
present bRAGq, a curated dataset of 1,302 bariatric surgery--related questions,
validated by an expert bariatric surgeon. bRAGq constitutes the first
large-scale, domain-specific benchmark for comprehensive MBS care. In a
two-phase evaluation, bRAGgen is benchmarked against state-of-the-art models
using both large language model (LLM)--based metrics and expert surgeon review.
Across all evaluation dimensions, bRAGgen demonstrates substantially superior
performance in generating clinically accurate and relevant responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 剪枝技术压缩模型时会导致安全性下降，需解决此问题。

Method: HSR方法量化注意力头对安全的贡献，识别关键头并选择性恢复其神经元，分层调整安全性。

Result: 在多种模型和剪枝策略中验证，显著提升安全性。

Conclusion: 首次明确针对剪枝后LVLMs安全性恢复的工作，效果显著。

Abstract: With the increasing size of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), network
pruning techniques aimed at compressing models for deployment in
resource-constrained environments have garnered significant attention. However,
we observe that pruning often leads to a degradation in safety performance. To
address this issue, we present a novel and lightweight approach, termed
Hierarchical Safety Realignment (HSR). HSR operates by first quantifying the
contribution of each attention head to safety, identifying the most critical
ones, and then selectively restoring neurons directly within these attention
heads that play a pivotal role in maintaining safety. This process
hierarchically realigns the safety of pruned LVLMs, progressing from the
attention head level to the neuron level. We validate HSR across various models
and pruning strategies, consistently achieving notable improvements in safety
performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly focused on
restoring safety in LVLMs post-pruning.

TLDR: 论文提出MPL框架，探索在监督微调阶段使用多种编程语言（如C++和Java）提升信息抽取任务的效果，并引入function-prompt和虚拟运行优化代码式输入。实验证明MPL有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要使用Python模拟代码式输入，忽略了其他广泛使用的编程语言（如C++和Java）在监督微调阶段的潜力。

Method: 提出MPL框架，结合多种编程语言进行监督微调，并引入function-prompt和虚拟运行技术。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了MPL的有效性。

Conclusion: MPL框架为信息抽取任务提供了新的思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent research in information extraction (IE) focuses on utilizing
code-style inputs to enhance structured output generation. The intuition behind
this is that the programming languages (PLs) inherently exhibit greater
structural organization than natural languages (NLs). This structural advantage
makes PLs particularly suited for IE tasks. Nevertheless, existing research
primarily focuses on Python for code-style simulation, overlooking the
potential of other widely-used PLs (e.g., C++ and Java) during the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) phase. In this research, we propose \textbf{M}ultiple
\textbf{P}rogramming \textbf{L}anguages with large language models for
information extraction (abbreviated as \textbf{MPL}), a novel framework that
explores the potential of incorporating different PLs in the SFT phase.
Additionally, we introduce \texttt{function-prompt} with virtual running to
simulate code-style inputs more effectively and efficiently. Experimental
results on a wide range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MPL.
Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to provide a comprehensive
analysis. We have released our code for future research.

Result: 研究发现休闲和社交期望比自然和情感因素更能驱动用户参与。

Conclusion: 该框架为旅游分析提供了精准工具，并展示了计算社会科学在营销优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Social media's rise establishes user-generated content (UGC) as pivotal for
travel decisions, yet analytical methods lack scalability. This study
introduces a dual-method LLM framework: unsupervised expectation extraction
from UGC paired with survey-informed supervised fine-tuning. Findings reveal
leisure/social expectations drive engagement more than foundational
natural/emotional factors. By establishing LLMs as precision tools for
expectation quantification, we advance tourism analytics methodology and
propose targeted strategies for experience personalization and social travel
promotion. The framework's adaptability extends to consumer behavior research,
demonstrating computational social science's transformative potential in
marketing optimization.

TLDR: KoBALT是一个针对韩语的综合性语言基准测试，包含700道选择题，覆盖5个语言领域，旨在评估大型语言模型在韩语中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准测试缺乏语言深度和类型学基础，KoBALT通过专家设计的问题填补这一空白，避免数据污染。

Method: KoBALT包含24种语言现象的700道选择题，问题设计减少与标准语料库的n-gram重叠。

Result: 评估20个LLM显示性能差异显著，最高准确率61%，语义表现最佳（66%），音系（31%）和形态（36%）较弱。人类评估验证了KoBALT的有效性。

Conclusion: KoBALT填补了韩语语言评估的空白，为评估语言模型的真实语言能力提供了可靠框架。

Abstract: We introduce KoBALT (Korean Benchmark for Advanced Linguistic Tasks), a
comprehensive linguistically-motivated benchmark comprising 700 multiple-choice
questions spanning 24 phenomena across five linguistic domains: syntax,
semantics, pragmatics, phonetics/phonology, and morphology. KoBALT is designed
to advance the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in Korean, a
morphologically rich language, by addressing the limitations of conventional
benchmarks that often lack linguistic depth and typological grounding. It
introduces a suite of expert-curated, linguistically motivated questions with
minimal n-gram overlap with standard Korean corpora, substantially mitigating
the risk of data contamination and allowing a more robust assessment of true
language understanding. Our evaluation of 20 contemporary LLMs reveals
significant performance disparities, with the highest-performing model
achieving 61\% general accuracy but showing substantial variation across
linguistic domains - from stronger performance in semantics (66\%) to
considerable weaknesses in phonology (31\%) and morphology (36\%). Through
human preference evaluation with 95 annotators, we demonstrate a strong
correlation between KoBALT scores and human judgments, validating our
benchmark's effectiveness as a discriminative measure of Korean language
understanding. KoBALT addresses critical gaps in linguistic evaluation for
typologically diverse languages and provides a robust framework for assessing
genuine linguistic competence in Korean language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs在数学、编程、常识和写作问题中对不同人口统计群体的解决方案真实性存在偏见，探讨其潜在影响。

Method: 通过实验分析五种与人类价值观对齐的LLMs，观察其在数学、编程、常识和写作问题中的表现。

Result: LLMs在数学和编程中更少将正确答案归因于非裔美国人群体，而在写作评估中更少偏好亚洲作者。

Conclusion: LLMs的人口统计偏见不仅限于表面刻板印象，可能影响教育和评估领域的应用。

Abstract: Despite LLMs' explicit alignment against demographic stereotypes, they have
been shown to exhibit biases under various social contexts. In this work, we
find that LLMs exhibit concerning biases in how they associate solution
veracity with demographics. Through experiments across five human value-aligned
LLMs on mathematics, coding, commonsense, and writing problems, we reveal two
forms of such veracity biases: Attribution Bias, where models
disproportionately attribute correct solutions to certain demographic groups,
and Evaluation Bias, where models' assessment of identical solutions varies
based on perceived demographic authorship. Our results show pervasive biases:
LLMs consistently attribute fewer correct solutions and more incorrect ones to
African-American groups in math and coding, while Asian authorships are least
preferred in writing evaluation. In additional studies, we show LLMs
automatically assign racially stereotypical colors to demographic groups in
visualization code, suggesting these biases are deeply embedded in models'
reasoning processes. Our findings indicate that demographic bias extends beyond
surface-level stereotypes and social context provocations, raising concerns
about LLMs' deployment in educational and evaluation settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接评分方法在片段级与人工评估相关性较低，需改进评估范式。

Method: 使用解码器LLMs生成参考译文，结合句子嵌入进行语义相似度评分。

Result: 在8种LLMs和8种语言对上验证，优于直接评分和非LLM参考无关指标。

Conclusion: 生成式评估结合语义分析具有优势，支持向混合方法转变。

Abstract: Recent studies have applied large language models (LLMs) to machine
translation quality estimation (MTQE) by prompting models to assign numeric
scores. Nonetheless, these direct scoring methods tend to show low
segment-level correlation with human judgments. In this paper, we propose a
generation-based evaluation paradigm that leverages decoder-only LLMs to
produce high-quality references, followed by semantic similarity scoring using
sentence embeddings. We conduct the most extensive evaluation to date in MTQE,
covering 8 LLMs and 8 language pairs. Empirical results show that our method
outperforms both intra-LLM direct scoring baselines and external non-LLM
reference-free metrics from MTME. These findings demonstrate the strength of
generation-based evaluation and support a shift toward hybrid approaches that
combine fluent generation with accurate semantic assessment.

Motivation: 理解大语言模型在不同语言中的位置偏见及其与模型不确定性和句法的交互作用。

Method: 对五种类型学不同的语言（英语、俄语、德语、印地语、越南语）进行跨语言研究，分析位置偏见与模型不确定性、句法和提示的关系。

Result: 发现位置偏见是模型驱动的，语言间有差异；明确的位置指导降低准确性；上下文对齐增加熵，但最小熵不预测准确性；LLMs在自由语序语言中强加主导词序。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了位置偏见的复杂性和语言多样性对其的影响，提示工程需重新评估。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit positional bias -- systematic neglect of
information at specific context positions -- yet its interplay with linguistic
diversity remains poorly understood. We present a cross-linguistic study across
five typologically distinct languages (English, Russian, German, Hindi,
Vietnamese), examining how positional bias interacts with model uncertainty,
syntax, and prompting. Key findings: (1) Positional bias is model-driven, with
language-specific variations -- Qwen2.5-7B favors late positions, challenging
assumptions of early-token bias; (2) Explicit positional guidance (e.g.,
correct context is at position X) reduces accuracy across languages,
undermining prompt-engineering practices; (3) Aligning context with positional
bias increases entropy, yet minimal entropy does not predict accuracy. (4) We
further uncover that LLMs differently impose dominant word order in
free-word-order languages like Hindi.

Motivation: 传统监督微调（SFT）无法有效传递教师模型的多分支推理结构，限制了学生模型的推理能力提升。

Method: 提出RLKD框架，结合强化学习和GSRM，通过奖励机制衡量学生与教师推理结构的对齐。

Result: 实验显示RLKD在少量数据下优于传统SFT-RL方法，显著提升学生模型的推理潜力。

Conclusion: RLKD通过捕捉教师模型的隐式多分支推理结构，实现了更高效的推理能力蒸馏。

Abstract: Distilling reasoning paths from teacher to student models via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) provides a shortcut for improving the reasoning ability of
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reasoning paths generated by
teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying
authentic reasoning. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that
authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning
(which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving
(which addresses the sub-problem). This implies authentic reasoning has an
implicit multi-branch structure. Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich
structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning
path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students. To
address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based
distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model
(GSRM). Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving
steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and
teacher reasoning. RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to
internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than
merely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard
SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime,
unlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation.

Abstract: As large language models continue to advance, their application in

we address this gap by introducing the first diverse benchmark tailored for
educational scenarios, incorporating synthetic data containing 9 major

assessment, we propose a set of multi-dimensional evaluation metrics that cover
12 critical aspects relevant to both teachers and students. We further apply
human annotation to ensure the effectiveness of the model-generated evaluation
responses. Additionally, we succeed to train a relatively small-scale model on
our constructed dataset and demonstrate that it can achieve performance
comparable to state-of-the-art large models (e.g., Deepseek V3, Qwen Max) on
the test set. Overall, this work provides a practical foundation for the

Result: 在多种模型和任务中实现1.3x-1.6x加速。

Conclusion: KNN-SSD有效提升自推测解码的领域适应性和加速性能。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a widely used paradigm to accelerate
the inference of large language models (LLMs) without compromising generation
quality. It works by efficiently drafting multiple tokens using a compact model
and then verifying them in parallel using the target LLM. Notably,
Self-Speculative Decoding proposes skipping certain layers to construct the
draft model, which eliminates the need for additional parameters or training.
Despite its strengths, we observe in this work that drafting with layer
skipping exhibits significant sensitivity to domain shifts, leading to a
substantial drop in acceleration performance. To enhance the domain
generalizability of this paradigm, we introduce KNN-SSD, an algorithm that
leverages K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search to match different skipped layers
with various domain inputs. We evaluated our algorithm in various models and
multiple tasks, observing that its application leads to 1.3x-1.6x speedup in
LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM是否能模拟人类在音素流畅性任务中的个体差异，以评估其作为人类行为替代者的潜力。

Method: 评估34种LLM配置（包括提示特异性、采样温度和模型类型），并与106名人类参与者的反应进行对比。

Result: 部分配置（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet）能匹配人类平均表现，但LLM输出多样性不足且结构僵化，无法重现人类变异性。

Conclusion: LLM在模拟人类认知和行为方面存在关键局限性，尤其是在多样性和结构灵活性上。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as substitutes for
human participants in cognitive tasks, but their ability to simulate human
behavioral variability remains unclear. This study examines whether LLMs can
approximate individual differences in the phonemic fluency task, where
participants generate words beginning with a target letter. We evaluated 34
model configurations, varying prompt specificity, sampling temperature, and
model type, and compared outputs to responses from 106 human participants.
While some configurations, especially Claude 3.7 Sonnet, matched human averages
and lexical preferences, none reproduced the scope of human variability. LLM
outputs were consistently less diverse and structurally rigid, and LLM
ensembles failed to increase diversity. Network analyses further revealed
fundamental differences in retrieval structure between humans and models. These
results highlight key limitations in using LLMs to simulate human cognition and
behavior.

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) admit their mistakes when they should know
better? In this work, we define the behavior of acknowledging errors in
previously generated answers as "retraction" and aim to understand when and why
LLMs choose to retract. We first construct model-specific datasets to evaluate
whether a model will retract an incorrect answer that contradicts its own
parametric knowledge. While LLMs are capable of retraction, they do so only
infrequently. We demonstrate that retraction is closely tied to previously
identified indicators of models' internal belief: models fail to retract wrong
answers that they "believe" to be factually correct. Steering experiments
further demonstrate that internal belief causally influences model retraction.
In particular, when the model does not believe its answer, this not only
encourages the model to attempt to verify the answer, but also alters attention
behavior during self-verification. Finally, we demonstrate that simple
supervised fine-tuning significantly improves retraction performance by helping
the model learn more accurate internal beliefs. Code and datasets are available

TLDR: 研究比较了生成式AI在简化健康信息时缺失的内容，并通过五种方法修复文本，发现添加所有缺失实体效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简化健康信息对健康生活至关重要，但生成式AI可能遗漏关键内容，需评估和修复。

Method: 收集50篇健康信息，用GPT-4简化，比较五种添加缺失实体和词的方法，评估语义相似性和内容重叠。

Result: 添加所有缺失实体效果最好，优于添加排名靠前的实体或随机词。

Conclusion: 当前工具能识别缺失实体，但无法有效排名，需进一步优化。

Abstract: Understanding health information is essential in achieving and maintaining a
healthy life. We focus on simplifying health information for better
understanding. With the availability of generative AI, the simplification
process has become efficient and of reasonable quality, however, the algorithms
remove information that may be crucial for comprehension. In this study, we
compare generative AI to detect missing information in simplified text,
evaluate its importance, and fix the text with the missing information. We
collected 50 health information texts and simplified them using gpt-4-0613. We
compare five approaches to identify missing elements and regenerate the text by
inserting the missing elements. These five approaches involve adding missing
entities and missing words in various ways: 1) adding all the missing entities,
2) adding all missing words, 3) adding the top-3 entities ranked by gpt-4-0613,
and 4, 5) serving as controls for comparison, adding randomly chosen entities.
We use cosine similarity and ROUGE scores to evaluate the semantic similarity
and content overlap between the original, simplified, and reconstructed
simplified text. We do this for both summaries and full text. Overall, we find
that adding missing entities improves the text. Adding all the missing entities
resulted in better text regeneration, which was better than adding the
top-ranked entities or words, or random words. Current tools can identify these
entities, but are not valuable in ranking them.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了语言模型（LMs）在事实召回任务中的表现，比较了两阶段训练和混合训练的效果，发现混合训练通过促进共享参数的形成，提升了模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型在通用任务上表现优异，但事实召回能力仍具挑战性。研究旨在理解不同训练策略如何影响模型参数及其事实召回能力。

Method: 通过交叉任务梯度追踪技术，识别受事实存储和事实召回示例共同影响的共享参数，并在Llama-3.2B和Pythia-2.8B模型上进行分析。

Result: 混合训练促进了更大且更集中的共享参数集的形成，这些参数可能对模型在任务间泛化事实知识起关键作用。

Conclusion: 共享参数的形成是混合训练提升事实召回能力的关键机制，为未来优化语言模型训练策略提供了新方向。

Abstract: Fact recall, the ability of language models (LMs) to retrieve specific
factual knowledge, remains a challenging task despite their impressive general
capabilities. Common training strategies often struggle to promote robust
recall behavior with two-stage training, which first trains a model with
fact-storing examples (e.g., factual statements) and then with fact-recalling
examples (question-answer pairs), tending to encourage rote memorization rather
than generalizable fact retrieval. In contrast, mixed training, which jointly
uses both types of examples, has been empirically shown to improve the ability
to recall facts, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In
this work, we investigate how these training strategies affect how model
parameters are shaped during training and how these differences relate to their
ability to recall facts. We introduce cross-task gradient trace to identify
shared parameters, those strongly influenced by both fact-storing and
fact-recalling examples. Our analysis on synthetic fact recall datasets with
the Llama-3.2B and Pythia-2.8B models reveals that mixed training encouraging a
larger and more centralized set of shared parameters. These findings suggest
that the emergence of parameters may play a key role in enabling LMs to
generalize factual knowledge across task formulations.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言理解和生成方面表现出色，但其行为的可靠控制仍具挑战性，尤其在开放生成环境中。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器获取稀疏潜在表示，训练线性分类器识别任务相关维度，并学习约束于该子空间的监督引导向量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在情感、真实性和政治极性等任务中成功率高，且生成质量下降最小。

Conclusion: 研究发现，仅需极小子空间即可实现有效引导，为更精准和可解释的干预提供了可能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation, but controlling their behavior
reliably remains challenging, especially in open-ended generation settings.
This paper introduces a novel supervised steering approach that operates in
sparse, interpretable representation spaces. We employ sparse autoencoders
(SAEs)to obtain sparse latent representations that aim to disentangle semantic
attributes from model activations. Then we train linear classifiers to identify
a small subspace of task-relevant dimensions in latent representations.
Finally, we learn supervised steering vectors constrained to this subspace,
optimized to align with target behaviors. Experiments across sentiment,
truthfulness, and politics polarity steering tasks with multiple LLMs
demonstrate that our supervised steering vectors achieve higher success rates
with minimal degradation in generation quality compared to existing methods.
Further analysis reveals that a notably small subspace is sufficient for
effective steering, enabling more targeted and interpretable interventions.

TLDR: 研究首次探讨了情感、具身性与日常语言在大规模自然语言数据中的关联，发现身体部位提及（BPMs）在文本中常见且与情绪及健康结果显著相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索情感、具身性与语言之间的关系，填补大规模自然语言数据中这一领域的研究空白。

Method: 构建在线英语文本（博客和推文）中身体部位提及的语料库，部分数据通过人工标注情绪，结合词-情感关联词典分析。

Result: BPMs在个人叙述和推文中常见（5%-10%），使用模式因时间和地点而异；含BPMs的文本情绪更强烈，且与较差健康结果显著相关。

Conclusion: 研究身体部位相关语言可为NLP、情感科学及人类福祉研究开辟新方向。

Abstract: This paper is the first investigation of the connection between emotion,
embodiment, and everyday language in a large sample of natural language data.
We created corpora of body part mentions (BPMs) in online English text (blog
posts and tweets). This includes a subset featuring human annotations for the
emotions of the person whose body part is mentioned in the text. We show that
BPMs are common in personal narratives and tweets (~5% to 10% of posts include
BPMs) and that their usage patterns vary markedly by time and %geographic
location. Using word-emotion association lexicons and our annotated data, we
show that text containing BPMs tends to be more emotionally charged, even when
the BPM is not explicitly used to describe a physical reaction to the emotion
in the text. Finally, we discover a strong and statistically significant
correlation between body-related language and a variety of poorer health
outcomes. In sum, we argue that investigating the role of body-part related
words in language can open up valuable avenues of future research at the
intersection of NLP, the affective sciences, and the study of human wellbeing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MLLMs在多模态情感分析（MSA）中的零样本表现不足问题，验证其是否具备与监督模型相当的情感感知能力。

Method: 扩展零样本范式为上下文学习（ICL），深入研究演示的检索、呈现和分布配置，并发现并抵消MLLMs的情感预测偏差。

Result: 优化后的策略在六个MSA数据集上平均准确率比零样本范式提升15.9%，比随机ICL基线提升11.2%。

Conclusion: MLLMs具备情感分析能力，通过优化ICL演示配置可显著提升性能，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
various multimodal tasks to be addressed under a zero-shot paradigm. This
paradigm sidesteps the cost of model fine-tuning, emerging as a dominant trend
in practical application. Nevertheless, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), a
pivotal challenge in the quest for general artificial intelligence, fails to
accommodate this convenience. The zero-shot paradigm exhibits undesirable
performance on MSA, casting doubt on whether MLLMs can perceive sentiments as
competent as supervised models. By extending the zero-shot paradigm to
In-Context Learning (ICL) and conducting an in-depth study on configuring
demonstrations, we validate that MLLMs indeed possess such capability.
Specifically, three key factors that cover demonstrations' retrieval,
presentation, and distribution are comprehensively investigated and optimized.
A sentimental predictive bias inherent in MLLMs is also discovered and later
effectively counteracted. By complementing each other, the devised strategies
for three factors result in average accuracy improvements of 15.9% on six MSA
datasets against the zero-shot paradigm and 11.2% against the random ICL
baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童语音的ASR转录准确性仍具挑战性，LLMs的应用在此领域尚未充分探索，尤其是在会话场景中。

Method: 通过实验评估LLMs在纠正两个儿童会话语音数据集上的ASR错误，包括零样本和微调ASR输出。

Result: LLMs能有效纠正零样本和微调CTC-based ASR输出，但在结合上下文或自回归ASR（如Whisper）输出时效果不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在儿童语音ASR纠错中具有潜力，但在某些场景（如上下文依赖或自回归模型）中仍需改进。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has recently shown remarkable progress,
but accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge.
Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
improving ASR transcriptions. However, their applications in child speech
including conversational scenarios are underexplored. In this study, we explore
the use of LLMs in correcting ASR errors for conversational child speech. We
demonstrate the promises and challenges of LLMs through experiments on two
children's conversational speech datasets with both zero-shot and fine-tuned
ASR outputs. We find that while LLMs are helpful in correcting zero-shot ASR
outputs and fine-tuned CTC-based ASR outputs, it remains challenging for LLMs
to improve ASR performance when incorporating contextual information or when
using fine-tuned autoregressive ASR (e.g., Whisper) outputs.

TLDR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）处理习语的机制，提出了多语言习语数据集MIDAS，并发现LLMs依赖记忆与推理结合的混合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语的独特语言特性使其难以处理，而LLMs在习语任务中的表现机制尚不明确，尤其是在多语言环境下。

Method: 引入MIDAS数据集，包含六种语言的习语及其含义，用于全面评估LLMs的习语处理能力。

Result: LLMs不仅依赖记忆，还结合上下文线索和推理，尤其在处理组合性习语时。

Conclusion: LLMs的习语理解是内部知识检索与推理推断相互作用的结果。

Abstract: Idioms have long posed a challenge due to their unique linguistic properties,
which set them apart from other common expressions. While recent studies have
leveraged large language models (LLMs) to handle idioms across various tasks,
e.g., idiom-containing sentence generation and idiomatic machine translation,
little is known about the underlying mechanisms of idiom processing in LLMs,
particularly in multilingual settings. To this end, we introduce MIDAS, a new
large-scale dataset of idioms in six languages, each paired with its
corresponding meaning. Leveraging this resource, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' idiom processing ability, identifying key factors that
influence their performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs rely not only on
memorization, but also adopt a hybrid approach that integrates contextual cues
and reasoning, especially when processing compositional idioms. This implies
that idiom understanding in LLMs emerges from an interplay between internal
knowledge retrieval and reasoning-based inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs被广泛用于代码评估，其是否能公平处理语义等效但表面有差异的代码成为关键问题。

Method: 定义了六种潜在偏见类型，并在五种编程语言和多个LLMs上进行了实证研究。

Result: 所有测试的LLMs均表现出正负偏见，导致评分偏高或偏低，即使生成测试用例后仍存在偏见。

Conclusion: 需要更稳健的代码评估方法以减少LLMs的偏见影响。

Abstract: With the growing use of large language models(LLMs) as evaluators, their
application has expanded to code evaluation tasks, where they assess the
correctness of generated code without relying on reference implementations.
While this offers scalability and flexibility, it also raises a critical,
unresolved question: Can LLM judges fairly and robustly evaluate semantically
equivalent code with superficial variations? Functionally correct code often
exhibits variations-such as differences in variable names, comments, or
formatting-that should not influence its correctness. Yet, whether LLM judges
can reliably handle these variations remains unclear. We present the first
comprehensive study of this issue, defining six types of potential bias in code
evaluation and revealing their systematic impact on LLM judges. Across five
programming languages and multiple LLMs, we empirically demonstrate that all
tested LLM judges are susceptible to both positive and negative biases,
resulting in inflated or unfairly low scores. Moreover, we observe that LLM
judges remain vulnerable to these biases even when prompted to generate test
cases before scoring, highlighting the need for more robust code evaluation
methods.

Motivation: 为了使技术文档对不同学科背景的读者更易理解，个性化术语检测和解释至关重要，但传统方法需要大量标注和计算资源。

Method: 研究了两种个性化策略：(1) 使用LoRA对开源模型进行轻量级微调；(2) 个性化提示，无需重新训练即可调整模型行为。还探索了结合有限标注数据和无监督用户背景信号的混合方法。

Result: 个性化LoRA模型的F1分数比GPT-4高21.4%，比最佳基线高8.3%，且仅需10%的标注数据即可达到可比性能。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统地探索了低资源个性化术语检测，为可扩展的用户自适应NLP系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making
technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary
backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires
substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific
finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized
jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for
real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1)
lightweight fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models,
and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time
without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate hybrid
approaches that combine limited annotated data with unsupervised user
background signals. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 by 21.4% in
F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably,
our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated
training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained
settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient,
low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language
models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估创意原创性的方法依赖人工分类，效率低且易出错，需要一种自动化、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: MuseRAG利用LLM和RAG框架，通过检索语义相似的创意类别并零样本判断新创意的归属，实现原创性评分。

Result: 在五个数据集上，MuseRAG与人类标注者在聚类结构和评分上表现一致（AMI=0.59，r=0.89），并具有强效度和外部效度。

Conclusion: MuseRAG为大规模、与人类对齐的原创性评分提供了高效工具，助力创造力研究。

Abstract: An objective, face-valid way to assess the originality of creative ideas is
to measure how rare each idea is within a population -- an approach long used
in creativity research but difficult to automate at scale. Tabulating response
frequencies via manual bucketing of idea rephrasings is labor-intensive,
error-prone, and brittle under large corpora. We introduce a fully automated,
psychometrically validated pipeline for frequency-based originality scoring.
Our method, MuseRAG, combines large language models (LLMs) with an externally
orchestrated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. Given a new idea,
the system retrieves semantically similar prior idea buckets and zero-shot
prompts the LLM to judge whether the new idea belongs to an existing bucket or
forms a new one. The resulting buckets enable computation of frequency-based
originality metrics. Across five datasets (N=1143, n_ideas=16294), MuseRAG
matches human annotators in idea clustering structure and resolution (AMI =
0.59) and in participant-level scoring (r = 0.89) -- while exhibiting strong
convergent and external validity. Our work enables intent-sensitive,
human-aligned originality scoring at scale to aid creativity research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM能解决复杂的长上下文推理问题，但在遵循明确长度指令（如生成特定长度的文本）时表现不佳，现有基准未充分评估这一点。

Method: 提出LIFEBench基准，包含10,800个实例，覆盖4类任务和16到8192词的长度范围，评估了26种常用LLM。

Result: 多数模型在短长度指令下表现合理，但在长长度指令下表现显著下降；几乎所有模型无法达到厂商声称的最大输出长度。推理型LLM表现优于专用长文本生成模型。

Conclusion: LIFEBench揭示了当前LLM在长度指令遵循上的根本局限性，为未来改进提供了关键见解。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) can solve PhD-level reasoning problems
over long context inputs, they still struggle with a seemingly simpler task:
following explicit length instructions-e.g., write a 10,000-word novel.
Additionally, models often generate far too short outputs, terminate
prematurely, or even refuse the request. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on
evaluating generations quality, but often overlook whether the generations meet
length constraints. To this end, we introduce Length Instruction Following
Evaluation Benchmark (LIFEBench) to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' ability to
follow length instructions across diverse tasks and a wide range of specified
lengths. LIFEBench consists of 10,800 instances across 4 task categories in
both English and Chinese, covering length constraints ranging from 16 to 8192
words. We evaluate 26 widely-used LLMs and find that most models reasonably
follow short-length instructions but deteriorate sharply beyond a certain
threshold. Surprisingly, almost all models fail to reach the vendor-claimed
maximum output lengths in practice, as further confirmed by our evaluations
extending up to 32K words. Even long-context LLMs, despite their extended
input-output windows, counterintuitively fail to improve length-instructions
following. Notably, Reasoning LLMs outperform even specialized long-text
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art length following. Overall,
LIFEBench uncovers fundamental limitations in current LLMs' length instructions
following ability, offering critical insights for future progress.

Method: 提出Align-GRAG框架，通过子图检索、图编码器与LLM推理联合优化，实现节点和表示的双对齐，并结合LLM生成答案。

Result: 在GraphQA基准测试的三个任务中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Align-GRAG通过双对齐优化，显著提升了图RAG的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but
still struggle with issues like hallucinations and outdated information.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses these issues by grounding LLM
outputs in external knowledge with an Information Retrieval (IR) system.
Building on this foundation, graph-based RAG systems go a step further by
retrieving subgraphs, which preserve the relationships between knowledge
entities and provide more comprehensive context. However, graph RAG faces two
challenges: (1) Retrieving relevant information introduces irrelevant nodes
(especially in dense graph databases, where retrieval usually extends to
adjacent nodes), and leads to overly lengthy inputs that hinder efficiency; (2)
The representation gap between graph and language during generation with LLMs
limits the ability to fully leverage graph structures for enhanced
understanding. To address these limitations, we propose Align-GRAG, a novel
reasoning-guided dual alignment framework in post-retrieval phrase. It first
formulates a subgraph by retrieving nodes and edges. Then an Aligner is
proposed to jointly optimizes a graph encoder with LLM-summarized reasoning. It
achieves dual alignment of graph node and representation by leveraging KL
divergence loss and contrastive loss, facilitating efficient pruning of
irrelevant knowledge and establishing a unified semantic space. The Generator
integrates the aligned graph data with LLM to produce coherent and accurate
answers. Experiments on GraphQA benchmark across three tasks (including common
sense reasoning, scene graph understanding, and knowledge graph reasoning)
validate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be available upon
accepted.

Motivation: 尽管LRMs在逻辑推理上表现优异，但其更强的推理能力可能带来更严重的安全漏洞，目前研究较少。

Method: 提出SEAL方法，采用堆叠加密和动态策略（随机与自适应）覆盖模型推理过程并规避安全对齐。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1、Claude Sonnet和GPT o4-mini等模型上验证，SEAL攻击成功率达80.8%，优于基线27.2%。

Conclusion: SEAL展示了LRMs的安全脆弱性，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated superior logical
capabilities compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), gaining
significant attention. Despite their impressive performance, the potential for
stronger reasoning abilities to introduce more severe security vulnerabilities
remains largely underexplored. Existing jailbreak methods often struggle to
balance effectiveness with robustness against adaptive safety mechanisms. In
this work, we propose SEAL, a novel jailbreak attack that targets LRMs through
an adaptive encryption pipeline designed to override their reasoning processes
and evade potential adaptive alignment. Specifically, SEAL introduces a stacked
encryption approach that combines multiple ciphers to overwhelm the models
reasoning capabilities, effectively bypassing built-in safety mechanisms. To
further prevent LRMs from developing countermeasures, we incorporate two
dynamic strategies - random and adaptive - that adjust the cipher length,
order, and combination. Extensive experiments on real-world reasoning models,
including DeepSeek-R1, Claude Sonnet, and OpenAI GPT-o4, validate the
effectiveness of our approach. Notably, SEAL achieves an attack success rate of
80.8% on GPT o4-mini, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a significant
margin of 27.2%. Warning: This paper contains examples of inappropriate,

TLDR: 论文提出Diverse-NS框架，通过控制长度提升语言模型输出的多样性，仅需3000对偏好数据即可有效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多样性指标和奖励模型偏向短输出，限制了表达多样性。

Method: 引入Diverse-NS框架，生成并过滤平衡多样性、质量和长度的偏好数据。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1-8B和Olmo-2模型上显著提升词汇和语义多样性，小模型可指导大模型。

Conclusion: Diverse-NS通过解决长度偏差，高效提升模型输出的多样性和表达力。

Abstract: Diverse language model responses are crucial for creative generation,
open-ended tasks, and self-improvement training. We show that common diversity
metrics, and even reward models used for preference optimization,
systematically bias models toward shorter outputs, limiting expressiveness. To
address this, we introduce Diverse, not Short (Diverse-NS), a length-controlled
self-learning framework that improves response diversity while maintaining
length parity. By generating and filtering preference data that balances
diversity, quality, and length, Diverse-NS enables effective training using
only 3,000 preference pairs. Applied to LLaMA-3.1-8B and the Olmo-2 family,
Diverse-NS substantially enhances lexical and semantic diversity. We show
consistent improvement in diversity with minor reduction or gains in response
quality on four creative generation tasks: Divergent Associations, Persona
Generation, Alternate Uses, and Creative Writing. Surprisingly, experiments
with the Olmo-2 model family (7B, and 13B) show that smaller models like
Olmo-2-7B can serve as effective "diversity teachers" for larger models. By
explicitly addressing length bias, our method efficiently pushes models toward
more diverse and expressive outputs.

TLDR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型中的知识遗忘问题，重新评估了局部遗忘方法的有效性，发现参数局部性并不直接决定遗忘效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型常保留非预期内容，促使对知识遗忘的研究兴趣增长。现有局部遗忘方法假设参数局部性与遗忘效果相关，但其有效性尚不明确。

Method: 重新审视现有局部遗忘方法，并进行控制实验，严格评估局部参数更新对遗忘的因果贡献。

Result: 研究发现，有效遗忘所需的参数修改并不严格确定，挑战了局部遗忘方法的核心假设。

Conclusion: 参数局部性并非知识遗忘效果的决定性因素，局部遗忘方法的有效性需重新评估。

Abstract: Large language models often retain unintended content, prompting growing
interest in knowledge unlearning. Recent approaches emphasize localized
unlearning, which restricts parameter updates to specific regions in an effort
to remove target knowledge while preserving unrelated general knowledge.
However, their effectiveness remains uncertain due to the lack of robust and
thorough evaluation of the trade-off between the competing goals of unlearning.
In this paper, we begin by revisiting existing localized unlearning approaches.
We then conduct controlled experiments to rigorously evaluate whether local
parameter updates causally contribute to unlearning. Our findings reveal that
the set of parameters that must be modified for effective unlearning is not
strictly determined, challenging the core assumption of localized unlearning
that parameter locality is inherently indicative of effective knowledge
removal.

Result: IRONIC在零样本多模态讽刺检测中表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合语言和认知洞察对多模态推理策略设计至关重要。

Abstract: Interpreting figurative language such as sarcasm across multi-modal inputs
presents unique challenges, often requiring task-specific fine-tuning and
extensive reasoning steps. However, current Chain-of-Thought approaches do not
efficiently leverage the same cognitive processes that enable humans to
identify sarcasm. We present IRONIC, an in-context learning framework that
leverages Multi-modal Coherence Relations to analyze referential, analogical
and pragmatic image-text linkages. Our experiments show that IRONIC achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection across
different baselines. This demonstrates the need for incorporating linguistic
and cognitive insights into the design of multi-modal reasoning strategies. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Transformer Copilot的新框架，通过记录模型学习过程中的错误（Mistake Log）并设计Copilot模型来修正主模型（Pilot）的推理性能，显著提升了任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的监督微调仅关注生成损失的最小化，而忽略了模型自身的学习信号。本文旨在通过记录和利用模型的错误行为（类似人类学习中的反思）来提升性能。

Method: 1. 引入Mistake Log系统记录模型在微调中的错误；2. 设计Copilot模型通过logits修正优化Pilot模型的推理；3. 提出联合训练和融合推理范式。

Result: 在12个基准测试中，Transformer Copilot性能提升最高达34.5%，且计算开销低，具有强扩展性和迁移性。

Conclusion: Transformer Copilot通过利用模型自身的学习信号和错误修正机制，显著提升了任务性能，为模型微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models are typically adapted to downstream tasks through
supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific data. While standard fine-tuning
focuses on minimizing generation loss to optimize model parameters, we take a
deeper step by retaining and leveraging the model's own learning signals,
analogous to how human learners reflect on past mistakes to improve future
performance. We first introduce the concept of Mistake Log to systematically
track the model's learning behavior and recurring errors throughout
fine-tuning. Treating the original transformer-based model as the Pilot, we
correspondingly design a Copilot model to refine the Pilot's inference
performance via logits rectification. We name the overall Pilot-Copilot
framework the Transformer Copilot, which introduces (i) a novel Copilot model
design, (ii) a joint training paradigm where the Copilot continuously learns
from the evolving Mistake Log alongside the Pilot, and (iii) a fused inference
paradigm where the Copilot rectifies the Pilot's logits for enhanced
generation. We provide both theoretical and empirical analyses on our new
learning framework. Experiments on 12 benchmarks spanning commonsense,
arithmetic, and recommendation tasks demonstrate that Transformer Copilot
consistently improves performance by up to 34.5%, while introducing marginal
computational overhead to Pilot models and exhibiting strong scalability and
transferability.

Abstract: The achievements of Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing,
especially for high-resource languages, call for a better understanding of
their characteristics from a cognitive perspective. Researchers have attempted
to evaluate artificial models by testing their ability to predict behavioral
(e.g., eye-tracking fixations) and physiological (e.g., brain responses)
variables during language processing (e.g., reading/listening). In this paper,
we propose using spontaneous speech corpora to derive production variables
(speech reductions, prosodic prominences) and applying them in a similar
fashion. More precisely, we extract. We then test models trained with a
standard procedure on different pretraining datasets (written, spoken, and
mixed genres) for their ability to predict these two variables. Our results
show that, after some fine-tuning, the models can predict these production
variables well above baselines. We also observe that spoken genre training data
provides more accurate predictions than written genres. These results
contribute to the broader effort of using high-quality speech corpora as
benchmarks for LLMs.

Result: HiMATE在多个数据集上表现优于基线方法，错误检测F1分数平均提升89%。

Conclusion: HiMATE通过分层多代理框架显著提升了机器翻译评估的准确性和人类对齐性。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables flexible and
interpretable automatic evaluations. In the field of machine translation
evaluation, utilizing LLMs with translation error annotations based on
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) yields more human-aligned judgments.
However, current LLM-based evaluation methods still face challenges in
accurately identifying error spans and assessing their severity. In this paper,
we propose HiMATE, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Machine Translation
Evaluation. We argue that existing approaches inadequately exploit the
fine-grained structural and semantic information within the MQM hierarchy. To
address this, we develop a hierarchical multi-agent system grounded in the MQM
error typology, enabling granular evaluation of subtype errors. Two key
strategies are incorporated to further mitigate systemic hallucinations within
the framework: the utilization of the model's self-reflection capability and
the facilitation of agent discussion involving asymmetric information.
Empirically, HiMATE outperforms competitive baselines across different datasets
in conducting human-aligned evaluations. Further analyses underscore its
significant advantage in error span detection and severity assessment,
achieving an average F1-score improvement of 89% over the best-performing
baseline. We make our code and data publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迭代RAG在多跳问答中面临长上下文和无关信息累积的挑战，影响模型性能和推理能力。

Method: Notes Writing方法在每一步从检索文档生成简洁笔记，减少噪音并保留关键信息，间接增加LLM的有效上下文长度。

Result: 在三种迭代RAG方法、两种模型和四个数据集上，Notes Writing平均提升15.6个百分点，输出标记增加极少。

Conclusion: Notes Writing是一种框架无关的方法，能有效提升迭代RAG的性能和推理能力。

Abstract: Iterative RAG for multi-hop question answering faces challenges with lengthy
contexts and the buildup of irrelevant information. This hinders a model's
capacity to process and reason over retrieved content and limits performance.
While recent methods focus on compressing retrieved information, they are
either restricted to single-round RAG, require finetuning or lack scalability
in iterative RAG. To address these challenges, we propose Notes Writing, a
method that generates concise and relevant notes from retrieved documents at
each step, thereby reducing noise and retaining only essential information.
This indirectly increases the effective context length of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling them to reason and plan more effectively while processing
larger volumes of input text. Notes Writing is framework agnostic and can be
integrated with different iterative RAG methods. We demonstrate its
effectiveness with three iterative RAG methods, across two models and four
evaluation datasets. Notes writing yields an average improvement of 15.6
percentage points overall, with minimal increase in output tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为ToDi的新型知识蒸馏方法，通过动态结合FKL和RKL，解决了传统方法在词汇表层面均匀应用损失的问题，显著提升了小模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）由于高延迟和能耗难以在资源受限的环境中部署，传统知识蒸馏方法（如FKL和RKL）忽略了词汇表中不同token的预测差异。

Method: 通过梯度分析发现FKL和RKL的互补作用，提出ToDi方法，使用基于sigmoid的权重函数动态结合FKL和RKL，实现更精确的分布对齐。

Result: ToDi在指令跟随基准测试中一致优于现有蒸馏基线，并通过消融实验和效率分析验证了其有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: ToDi通过动态调整FKL和RKL的权重，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果，为资源受限环境下的模型部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer impressive performance but are impractical
for resource-constrained deployment due to high latency and energy consumption.
Knowledge distillation (KD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from a
large teacher to a smaller student model. However, conventional KD, notably
approaches like Forward KL (FKL) and Reverse KL (RKL), apply uniform divergence
loss across the entire vocabulary, neglecting token-level prediction
discrepancies. By investigating these representative divergences via gradient
analysis, we reveal that FKL boosts underestimated tokens, while RKL suppresses
overestimated ones, showing their complementary roles. Based on this
observation, we propose Token-wise Distillation (ToDi), a novel method that
adaptively combines FKL and RKL per token using a sigmoid-based weighting
function derived from the teacher-student probability log-ratio. ToDi
dynamically emphasizes the appropriate divergence for each token, enabling
precise distribution alignment. We demonstrate that ToDi consistently
outperforms recent distillation baselines using uniform or less granular
strategies across instruction-following benchmarks. Extensive ablation studies
and efficiency analysis further validate ToDi's effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing is a pivotal technique for navigating a
diverse landscape of LLMs, aiming to select the best-performing LLMs tailored
to the domains of user queries, while managing computational resources.
However, current routing approaches often face limitations in scalability when
dealing with a large pool of specialized LLMs, or in their adaptability to
extending model scope and evolving capability domains. To overcome those
challenges, we propose InferenceDynamics, a flexible and scalable
multi-dimensional routing framework by modeling the capability and knowledge of
models. We operate it on our comprehensive dataset RouteMix, and demonstrate
its effectiveness and generalizability in group-level routing using modern
benchmarks including MMLU-Pro, GPQA, BigGenBench, and LiveBench, showcasing its
ability to identify and leverage top-performing models for given tasks, leading
to superior outcomes with efficient resource utilization. The broader adoption
of Inference Dynamics can empower users to harness the full specialized
potential of the LLM ecosystem, and our code will be made publicly available to
encourage further research.

Method: PMPO利用交叉熵损失评估提示质量，通过掩码和损失最小化改进提示，仅需前向传播和似然计算。

Result: PMPO在BBH、GSM8K、AQUA-RAT和AlpacaEval 2.0等任务中表现优于现有方法，显著提升准确率和胜率。

Conclusion: PMPO是一种高效、通用的提示优化方法，适用于不同规模和任务的模型。

Abstract: Prompt optimization offers a practical and broadly applicable alternative to
fine-tuning for improving large language model (LLM) performance. However,
existing methods often rely on costly output generation, self-critiquing
abilities, or human-annotated preferences, which limit their scalability,
especially for smaller or non-instruction-tuned models. We introduce PMPO
(Probabilistic Metric Prompt Optimization), a unified framework that refines
prompts using token-level cross-entropy loss as a direct, lightweight
evaluation signal. PMPO identifies low-quality prompt segments by masking and
measuring their impact on loss, then rewrites and selects improved variants by
minimizing loss over positive and negative examples. Unlike prior methods, it
requires no output sampling or human evaluation during optimization, relying
only on forward passes and log-likelihoods. PMPO supports both supervised and
preference-based tasks through a closely aligned loss-based evaluation
strategy. Experiments show that PMPO consistently outperforms prior methods
across model sizes and tasks: it achieves the highest average accuracy on BBH,
performs strongly on GSM8K and AQUA-RAT, and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 win rates
by over 19 points. These results highlight PMPO's effectiveness, efficiency,
and broad applicability.

Result: CLEAR在提取临床属性和提供与临床判断高度一致的自动化指标方面表现出高准确性。

Conclusion: CLEAR为放射学报告评估提供了更全面和临床可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing metrics often lack the granularity and interpretability to capture
nuanced clinical differences between candidate and ground-truth radiology
reports, resulting in suboptimal evaluation. We introduce a Clinically-grounded
tabular framework with Expert-curated labels and Attribute-level comparison for
Radiology report evaluation (CLEAR). CLEAR not only examines whether a report
can accurately identify the presence or absence of medical conditions, but also
assesses whether it can precisely describe each positively identified condition
across five key attributes: first occurrence, change, severity, descriptive
location, and recommendation. Compared to prior works, CLEAR's
multi-dimensional, attribute-level outputs enable a more comprehensive and
clinically interpretable evaluation of report quality. Additionally, to measure
the clinical alignment of CLEAR, we collaborate with five board-certified
radiologists to develop CLEAR-Bench, a dataset of 100 chest X-ray reports from
MIMIC-CXR, annotated across 6 curated attributes and 13 CheXpert conditions.
Our experiments show that CLEAR achieves high accuracy in extracting clinical
attributes and provides automated metrics that are strongly aligned with
clinical judgment.

Conclusion: 论文提出了评估新颖性的有效章节组合，为自动化评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Novelty is a core component of academic papers, and there are multiple
perspectives on the assessment of novelty. Existing methods often focus on word
or entity combinations, which provide limited insights. The content related to
a paper's novelty is typically distributed across different core sections,
e.g., Introduction, Methodology and Results. Therefore, exploring the optimal
combination of sections for evaluating the novelty of a paper is important for
advancing automated novelty assessment. In this paper, we utilize different
combinations of sections from academic papers as inputs to drive language
models to predict novelty scores. We then analyze the results to determine the
optimal section combinations for novelty score prediction. We first employ
natural language processing techniques to identify the sectional structure of
academic papers, categorizing them into introduction, methods, results, and
discussion (IMRaD). Subsequently, we used different combinations of these
sections (e.g., introduction and methods) as inputs for pretrained language
models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs), employing novelty scores
provided by human expert reviewers as ground truth labels to obtain prediction
results. The results indicate that using introduction, results and discussion
is most appropriate for assessing the novelty of a paper, while the use of the
entire text does not yield significant results. Furthermore, based on the
results of the PLMs and LLMs, the introduction and results appear to be the
most important section for the task of novelty score prediction. The code and

Conclusion: 研究为未来开发更有效的个性化具身代理提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Embodied agents empowered by large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in household object rearrangement tasks. However, these tasks
primarily focus on single-turn interactions with simplified instructions, which
do not truly reflect the challenges of providing meaningful assistance to
users. To provide personalized assistance, embodied agents must understand the
unique semantics that users assign to the physical world (e.g., favorite cup,
breakfast routine) by leveraging prior interaction history to interpret
dynamic, real-world instructions. Yet, the effectiveness of embodied agents in
utilizing memory for personalized assistance remains largely underexplored. To
address this gap, we present MEMENTO, a personalized embodied agent evaluation
framework designed to comprehensively assess memory utilization capabilities to
provide personalized assistance. Our framework consists of a two-stage memory
evaluation process design that enables quantifying the impact of memory
utilization on task performance. This process enables the evaluation of agents'
understanding of personalized knowledge in object rearrangement tasks by
focusing on its role in goal interpretation: (1) the ability to identify target
objects based on personal meaning (object semantics), and (2) the ability to
infer object-location configurations from consistent user patterns, such as
routines (user patterns). Our experiments across various LLMs reveal
significant limitations in memory utilization, with even frontier models like
GPT-4o experiencing a 30.5% performance drop when required to reference
multiple memories, particularly in tasks involving user patterns. These
findings, along with our detailed analyses and case studies, provide valuable
insights for future research in developing more effective personalized embodied
agents. Project website: https://connoriginal.github.io/MEMENTO

Motivation: RoPE的位置编码仅依赖相对位置，限制了其表达能力，因此需要更灵活的数据依赖方案。

Method: 提出PaTH，基于数据依赖的Householder变换，开发高效并行训练算法和FlashAttention风格块算法。

Result: 在合成基准和实际语言建模实验中，PaTH表现优于RoPE及其他基线方法。

Conclusion: PaTH通过数据依赖的位置编码提升了表达能力，为LLMs提供了更优的位置编码方案。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core primitive in modern large language models
(LLMs) and AI more broadly. Since attention by itself is permutation-invariant,
position encoding is essential for modeling structured domains such as
language. Rotary position encoding (RoPE) has emerged as the de facto standard
approach for position encoding and is part of many modern LLMs. However, in
RoPE the key/query transformation between two elements in a sequence is only a
function of their relative position and otherwise independent of the actual
input. This limits the expressivity of RoPE-based transformers.
  This paper describes PaTH, a flexible data-dependent position encoding scheme
based on accumulated products of Householder(like) transformations, where each
transformation is data-dependent, i.e., a function of the input. We derive an
efficient parallel algorithm for training through exploiting a compact
representation of products of Householder matrices, and implement a
FlashAttention-style blockwise algorithm that minimizes I/O cost. Across both
targeted synthetic benchmarks and moderate-scale real-world language modeling
experiments, we find that PaTH demonstrates superior performance compared to
RoPE and other recent baselines.

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs的可解释性提供了新见解，并提出了一种改进跨语言能力的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability in cross-lingual
tasks. Understanding how LLMs acquire this ability is crucial for their
interpretability. To quantify the cross-lingual ability of LLMs accurately, we
propose a Word-Level Cross-Lingual Translation Task. To find how LLMs learn
cross-lingual ability, we trace the outputs of LLMs' intermediate layers in the
word translation task. We identify and distinguish two distinct behaviors in
the forward pass of LLMs: co-occurrence behavior and semantic pivot behavior.
We attribute LLMs' two distinct behaviors to the co-occurrence frequency of
words and find the semantic pivot from the pre-training dataset. Finally, to
apply our findings to improve the cross-lingual ability of LLMs, we reconstruct
a semantic pivot-aware pre-training dataset using documents with a high
proportion of semantic pivots. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach in enhancing cross-lingual ability. Our research contributes
insights into the interpretability of LLMs and offers a method for improving
LLMs' cross-lingual ability.

Method: 提出错误分类法，重点关注信息失真；构建并行数据集，包含自动简化的科学文本，并人工标注；分析数据集质量及现有模型在错误检测和分类上的表现。

Result: 提供了用于评估ATS错误的工具，帮助开发更可靠的模型，提升自动简化文本的质量。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了ATS评估的空白，为研究者提供了改进模型和提升文本简化质量的资源。

Abstract: The general public often encounters complex texts but does not have the time
or expertise to fully understand them, leading to the spread of misinformation.
Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) helps make information more accessible, but
its evaluation methods have not kept up with advances in text generation,
especially with Large Language Models (LLMs). In particular, recent studies
have shown that current ATS metrics do not correlate with the presence of
errors. Manual inspections have further revealed a variety of errors,
underscoring the need for a more nuanced evaluation framework, which is
currently lacking. This resource paper addresses this gap by introducing a test
collection for detecting and classifying errors in simplified texts. First, we
propose a taxonomy of errors, with a formal focus on information distortion.
Next, we introduce a parallel dataset of automatically simplified scientific
texts. This dataset has been human-annotated with labels based on our proposed
taxonomy. Finally, we analyze the quality of the dataset, and we study the
performance of existing models to detect and classify errors from that
taxonomy. These contributions give researchers the tools to better evaluate
errors in ATS, develop more reliable models, and ultimately improve the quality
of automatically simplified texts.

TLDR: 论文研究了特征归因方法在语音处理中的可靠性，发现标准方法在语音领域通常不可靠，但词对齐扰动方法在基于词的分类任务中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模预训练模型能力的提升，理解其输出决定因素变得更重要。特征归因旨在揭示输入中哪些部分对模型输出贡献最大，但在语音处理中，输入信号的独特性使特征归因方法的应用具有挑战性。

Method: 研究了输入类型、聚合和扰动时间跨度等因素对标准特征归因方法可靠性的影响，以及这些因素与分类任务特性的交互作用。

Result: 标准特征归因方法在语音领域通常不可靠，但词对齐扰动方法在基于词的分类任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: 标准特征归因方法在语音处理中可靠性有限，需根据任务特性选择合适方法。

Abstract: As the capabilities of large-scale pre-trained models evolve, understanding
the determinants of their outputs becomes more important. Feature attribution
aims to reveal which parts of the input elements contribute the most to model
outputs. In speech processing, the unique characteristics of the input signal
make the application of feature attribution methods challenging. We study how
factors such as input type and aggregation and perturbation timespan impact the
reliability of standard feature attribution methods, and how these factors
interact with characteristics of each classification task. We find that
standard approaches to feature attribution are generally unreliable when
applied to the speech domain, with the exception of word-aligned perturbation
methods when applied to word-based classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文研究了基于世界价值观调查（WVS）数据训练大型语言模型（LLM）的文化价值适应问题，发现仅依赖调查数据会导致文化同质化并干扰事实知识。通过结合维基百科和NormAd的叙事数据，提升了文化独特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决LLM在文化价值适应中的偏见和训练数据不足问题，探索如何更有效地捕捉文化细微差别。

Method: 方法包括系统研究WVS数据训练，并引入维基百科和NormAd的叙事数据以增强文化多样性。

Result: 结果表明，仅依赖WVS数据会导致文化同质化，而结合叙事数据能显著提升文化独特性。

Conclusion: 结论指出文化价值对齐具有复杂性，需结合多种数据源以指导任务特定行为。

Abstract: Adapting cultural values in Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant
challenges, particularly due to biases and limited training data. Prior work
primarily aligns LLMs with different cultural values using World Values Survey
(WVS) data. However, it remains unclear whether this approach effectively
captures cultural nuances or produces distinct cultural representations for
various downstream tasks. In this paper, we systematically investigate
WVS-based training for cultural value adaptation and find that relying solely
on survey data can homogenize cultural norms and interfere with factual
knowledge. To investigate these issues, we augment WVS with encyclopedic and
scenario-based cultural narratives from Wikipedia and NormAd. While these
narratives may have variable effects on downstream tasks, they consistently
improve cultural distinctiveness than survey data alone. Our work highlights
the inherent complexity of aligning cultural values with the goal of guiding
task-specific behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在推理能力上表现出色，但如何通过强化学习实现多工具协作推理仍是一个未解决的挑战。

Method: Tool-Star结合了六种工具，设计了数据合成和训练框架，包括工具集成提示、质量归一化和两阶段训练（冷启动微调和多工具自评RL算法）。

Result: 在超过10个具有挑战性的推理基准测试中，Tool-Star表现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: Tool-Star通过系统设计和强化学习，成功提升了LLMs在多工具协作推理中的能力。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning
capabilities via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). However, leveraging
the RL algorithm to empower effective multi-tool collaborative reasoning in
LLMs remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tool-Star, an
RL-based framework designed to empower LLMs to autonomously invoke multiple
external tools during stepwise reasoning. Tool-Star integrates six types of
tools and incorporates systematic designs in both data synthesis and training.
To address the scarcity of tool-use data, we propose a general tool-integrated
reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which combines tool-integrated prompting
with hint-based sampling to automatically and scalably generate tool-use
trajectories. A subsequent quality normalization and difficulty-aware
classification process filters out low-quality samples and organizes the
dataset from easy to hard. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training
framework to enhance multi-tool collaborative reasoning by: (1) cold-start
fine-tuning, which guides LLMs to explore reasoning patterns via
tool-invocation feedback; and (2) a multi-tool self-critic RL algorithm with
hierarchical reward design, which reinforces reward understanding and promotes
effective tool collaboration. Experimental analyses on over 10 challenging
reasoning benchmarks highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of Tool-Star.

Motivation: 当前基于检索增强生成（RAG）的方法在内容归因方面存在计算成本高的问题，需要微调或人工标注。

Method: 引入ARC-JSD方法，利用Jensen-Shannon散度直接识别关键上下文句子。

Result: 在多个RAG基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: ARC-JSD为RAG模型的内容归因提供了高效解决方案，并揭示了模型内部工作机制。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs)
combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of
generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to
specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the
computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require
extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel
Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context
(ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context
sentences without additional fine-tuning or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on
a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using
instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and
significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous
surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific
attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context
attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG
models.

Method: 通过分析多样性增强方法、超参数、输入输出格式和模型，研究多样性与广告质量的关系。

Result: 研究发现广告文本生成中多样性与质量的关系受多种因素影响，需综合考虑方法选择和参数调整。

Conclusion: 广告文本生成需针对性优化多样性增强方法，以适应其独特的文本风格和要求。

Abstract: In natural language generation for advertising, creating diverse and engaging
ad texts is crucial for capturing a broad audience and avoiding advertising
fatigue. Regardless of the importance of diversity, the impact of the
diversity-enhancing methods in ad text generation -- mainly tested on tasks
such as summarization and machine translation -- has not been thoroughly
explored. Ad text generation significantly differs from these tasks owing to
the text style and requirements. This research explores the relationship
between diversity and ad quality in ad text generation by considering multiple
factors, such as diversity-enhancing methods, their hyperparameters,
input-output formats, and the models.

Motivation: 现有的强化学习主要关注单轮任务，而多轮交互的网络代理训练因复杂的长期决策而具有挑战性。

Method: WebAgent-R1通过异步生成多样化的轨迹，直接从与网络环境的在线交互中学习，依赖任务成功的二元奖励。

Result: 在WebArena-Lite基准测试中，WebAgent-R1将Qwen-2.5-3B和Llama-3.1-8B的任务成功率分别从6.1%提升至33.9%和8.5%提升至44.8%。

Conclusion: WebAgent-R1展示了基于思考的提示策略和测试时扩展的有效性，同时强调了热身训练阶段的重要性。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
enhancing large language models (LLMs), it has primarily focused on single-turn
tasks such as solving math problems. Training effective web agents for
multi-turn interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of
long-horizon decision-making across dynamic web interfaces. In this work, we
present WebAgent-R1, a simple yet effective end-to-end multi-turn RL framework
for training web agents. It learns directly from online interactions with web
environments by asynchronously generating diverse trajectories, entirely guided
by binary rewards depending on task success. Experiments on the WebArena-Lite
benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of WebAgent-R1, boosting the task
success rate of Qwen-2.5-3B from 6.1% to 33.9% and Llama-3.1-8B from 8.5% to
44.8%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and strong
proprietary models such as OpenAI o3. In-depth analyses reveal the
effectiveness of the thinking-based prompting strategy and test-time scaling
through increased interactions for web tasks. We further investigate different
RL initialization policies by introducing two variants, namely WebAgent-R1-Zero
and WebAgent-R1-CoT, which highlight the importance of the warm-up training
stage (i.e., behavior cloning) and provide insights on incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in web agents.

Motivation: 程序性知识的有效传达在NLP中仍具挑战性，纯文本难以表达复杂动作和空间关系。

Method: 1. 基于选区解析器的文本编码机制；2. 成对话语一致性模型；3. 新的评估协议。

Result: 在三个数据集上显著优于基线，生成更准确的视觉内容。

Conclusion: 为程序性语言的视觉落地提供了新方法，适用于教育、任务指导和多模态语言理解。

Abstract: The effective communication of procedural knowledge remains a significant
challenge in natural language processing (NLP), as purely textual instructions
often fail to convey complex physical actions and spatial relationships. We
address this limitation by proposing a language-driven framework that
translates procedural text into coherent visual instructions. Our approach
models the linguistic structure of instructional content by decomposing it into
goal statements and sequential steps, then conditioning visual generation on
these linguistic elements. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a
constituency parser-based text encoding mechanism that preserves semantic
completeness even with lengthy instructions, (2) a pairwise discourse coherence
model that maintains consistency across instruction sequences, and (3) a novel
evaluation protocol specifically designed for procedural language-to-image
alignment. Our experiments across three instructional datasets (HTStep,
CaptainCook4D, and WikiAll) demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing baselines in generating visuals that accurately reflect
the linguistic content and sequential nature of instructions. This work
contributes to the growing body of research on grounding procedural language in
visual content, with applications spanning education, task guidance, and
multimodal language understanding.

Motivation: 传统A/B测试资源消耗大，离线方法难以捕捉动态用户-平台交互，而现有模拟平台缺乏用户行为动态重塑环境的能力。

Method: 引入RecInter平台，采用多维用户画像、高级代理架构和基于链式思维（CoT）的LLM微调，实现高保真模拟。

Result: 实验表明，RecInter显著提升了模拟可信度，成功复现了品牌忠诚度和马太效应等涌现现象。

Conclusion: RecInter为推荐系统研究提供了一个可信的测试平台，其交互机制对模拟真实系统演化至关重要。

Abstract: Evaluating and iterating upon recommender systems is crucial, yet traditional
A/B testing is resource-intensive, and offline methods struggle with dynamic
user-platform interactions. While agent-based simulation is promising, existing
platforms often lack a mechanism for user actions to dynamically reshape the
environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce RecInter, a novel agent-based
simulation platform for recommender systems featuring a robust interaction
mechanism. In RecInter platform, simulated user actions (e.g., likes, reviews,
purchases) dynamically update item attributes in real-time, and introduced
Merchant Agents can reply, fostering a more realistic and evolving ecosystem.
High-fidelity simulation is ensured through Multidimensional User Profiling
module, Advanced Agent Architecture, and LLM fine-tuned on Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) enriched interaction data. Our platform achieves significantly improved
simulation credibility and successfully replicates emergent phenomena like
Brand Loyalty and the Matthew Effect. Experiments demonstrate that this
interaction mechanism is pivotal for simulating realistic system evolution,
establishing our platform as a credible testbed for recommender systems
research.

Conclusion: 提示编码器结合分类器训练在多语言情感分类中效果显著，集成模型表现最佳。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for SemEval 2025 Task 11 Track A, focusing
on multilabel emotion classification across 28 languages. We explore two main
strategies: fully fine-tuning transformer models and classifier-only training,
evaluating different settings such as fine-tuning strategies, model
architectures, loss functions, encoders, and classifiers. Our findings suggest
that training a classifier on top of prompt-based encoders such as mE5 and BGE
yields significantly better results than fully fine-tuning XLMR and mBERT. Our
best-performing model on the final leaderboard is an ensemble combining
multiple BGE models, where CatBoost serves as the classifier, with different
configurations. This ensemble achieves an average F1-macro score of 56.58
across all languages.

Motivation: 探索LLMs如何基于刻板印象线索推断用户身份，及其对回应质量的影响。

Method: 使用合成对话分析LLMs的潜在用户表征，结合模型内部和生成答案。

Result: LLMs确实基于刻板信号推断身份，且部分情况下无视用户明确身份。通过干预内部表征可缓解此问题。

Conclusion: 需提高LLMs在用户身份表征上的透明度和可控性。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) infer user's demographic information
from subtle cues in the conversation -- a phenomenon called implicit
personalization. Prior work has shown that such inferences can lead to lower
quality responses for users assumed to be from minority groups, even when no
demographic information is explicitly provided. In this work, we systematically
explore how LLMs respond to stereotypical cues using controlled synthetic
conversations, by analyzing the models' latent user representations through
both model internals and generated answers to targeted user questions. Our
findings reveal that LLMs do infer demographic attributes based on these
stereotypical signals, which for a number of groups even persists when the user
explicitly identifies with a different demographic group. Finally, we show that
this form of stereotype-driven implicit personalization can be effectively
mitigated by intervening on the model's internal representations using a
trained linear probe to steer them toward the explicitly stated identity. Our
results highlight the need for greater transparency and control in how LLMs
represent user identity.

Result: CANOE在11个下游任务中显著提升LLM的忠实性，甚至超越GPT-4o等先进模型。

Conclusion: CANOE框架有效提升LLM的忠实性，无需人工标注，适用于多种生成任务。

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to be faithful in the provided context
is crucial for building reliable information-seeking systems. Therefore, we
propose a systematic framework, CANOE, to improve the faithfulness of LLMs in
both short-form and long-form generation tasks without human annotations.
Specifically, we first synthesize short-form question-answering (QA) data with
four diverse tasks to construct high-quality and easily verifiable training
data without human annotation. Also, we propose Dual-GRPO, a rule-based
reinforcement learning method that includes three tailored rule-based rewards
derived from synthesized short-form QA data, while simultaneously optimizing
both short-form and long-form response generation. Notably, Dual-GRPO
eliminates the need to manually label preference data to train reward models
and avoids over-optimizing short-form generation when relying only on the
synthesized short-form QA data. Experimental results show that CANOE greatly
improves the faithfulness of LLMs across 11 different downstream tasks, even
outperforming the most advanced LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o and OpenAI o1.

Method: 使用探针分类器分析Llama模型各层的情感编码，识别最佳捕捉情感信号的层和池化方法。

Result: 情感信息在二元极性任务中集中于中间层，检测准确率提升14%；解码器模型中最后一个令牌并非最有效。

Conclusion: 层特异性探测是情感任务的有效方法，可提升模型效用并降低内存需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become central to NLP,
demonstrating their ability to adapt to various tasks through prompting
techniques, including sentiment analysis. However, we still have a limited
understanding of how these models capture sentiment-related information. This
study probes the hidden layers of Llama models to pinpoint where sentiment
features are most represented and to assess how this affects sentiment
analysis.
  Using probe classifiers, we analyze sentiment encoding across layers and
scales, identifying the layers and pooling methods that best capture sentiment
signals. Our results show that sentiment information is most concentrated in
mid-layers for binary polarity tasks, with detection accuracy increasing up to
14% over prompting techniques. Additionally, we find that in decoder-only
models, the last token is not consistently the most informative for sentiment
encoding. Finally, this approach enables sentiment tasks to be performed with
memory requirements reduced by an average of 57%.
  These insights contribute to a broader understanding of sentiment in LLMs,
suggesting layer-specific probing as an effective approach for sentiment tasks
beyond prompting, with potential to enhance model utility and reduce memory
requirements.

Motivation: 上诉过程是司法系统中的核心纠错机制，但现有LegalAI研究多关注一审案件，忽略了上诉分析的重要性。

Method: 构建了包含10,000对匹配的一审和二审文档的AppealCase数据集，标注了五个关键维度，并提出了五项新任务，评估了20个主流模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有模型在判决逆转预测任务上的F1分数均低于50%，表明上诉场景的复杂性。

Conclusion: AppealCase数据集有望推动LegalAI在上诉案件分析中的研究，并提升司法决策的一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in LegalAI have primarily focused on individual case judgment
analysis, often overlooking the critical appellate process within the judicial
system. Appeals serve as a core mechanism for error correction and ensuring
fair trials, making them highly significant both in practice and in research.
To address this gap, we present the AppealCase dataset, consisting of 10,000
pairs of real-world, matched first-instance and second-instance documents
across 91 categories of civil cases. The dataset also includes detailed
annotations along five dimensions central to appellate review: judgment
reversals, reversal reasons, cited legal provisions, claim-level decisions, and
whether there is new information in the second instance. Based on these
annotations, we propose five novel LegalAI tasks and conduct a comprehensive
evaluation across 20 mainstream models. Experimental results reveal that all
current models achieve less than 50% F1 scores on the judgment reversal
prediction task, highlighting the complexity and challenge of the appeal
scenario. We hope that the AppealCase dataset will spur further research in
LegalAI for appellate case analysis and contribute to improving consistency in
judicial decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型（LMs）在知识密集型任务中可能忽略或误用上下文信息，现有CMTs缺乏系统比较，因此需要开发一个基准来评估其性能。

Method: 开发CUB基准，测试七种代表性CMTs在三种上下文类型和多样化数据集上的表现，应用于九种LMs。

Result: 现有CMTs在真实场景中表现不佳，且在合成数据集上性能被高估。

Conclusion: 需要开发能处理多种上下文类型的CMTs，并进行更全面的测试。

Abstract: Incorporating external knowledge is crucial for knowledge-intensive tasks,
such as question answering and fact checking. However, language models (LMs)
may ignore relevant information that contradicts outdated parametric memory or
be distracted by irrelevant contexts. While many context utilisation
manipulation techniques (CMTs) that encourage or suppress context utilisation
have recently been proposed to alleviate these issues, few have seen systematic
comparison. In this paper, we develop CUB (Context Utilisation Benchmark) to
help practitioners within retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) identify the
best CMT for their needs. CUB allows for rigorous testing on three distinct
context types, observed to capture key challenges in realistic context
utilisation scenarios. With this benchmark, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art
methods, representative of the main categories of CMTs, across three diverse
datasets and tasks, applied to nine LMs. Our results show that most of the
existing CMTs struggle to handle the full set of types of contexts that may be
encountered in real-world retrieval-augmented scenarios. Moreover, we find that
many CMTs display an inflated performance on simple synthesised datasets,
compared to more realistic datasets with naturally occurring samples.
Altogether, our results show the need for holistic tests of CMTs and the
development of CMTs that can handle multiple context types.

Abstract: Factual hallucinations are a major challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). They undermine reliability and user trust by generating inaccurate or
fabricated content. Recent studies suggest that when generating false
statements, the internal states of LLMs encode information about truthfulness.
However, these studies often rely on synthetic datasets that lack realism,
which limits generalization when evaluating the factual accuracy of text
generated by the model itself. In this paper, we challenge the findings of
previous work by investigating truthfulness encoding capabilities, leading to
the generation of a more realistic and challenging dataset. Specifically, we
extend previous work by introducing: (1) a strategy for sampling plausible
true-false factoid sentences from tabular data and (2) a procedure for
generating realistic, LLM-dependent true-false datasets from Question Answering
collections. Our analysis of two open-source LLMs reveals that while the
findings from previous studies are partially validated, generalization to
LLM-generated datasets remains challenging. This study lays the groundwork for
future research on factuality in LLMs and offers practical guidelines for more
effective evaluation.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种多偏差基准和因果效应估计引导的多偏差消除方法（CMBE），以解决现有大语言模型（LLM）在推理中存在的多偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在推理中可能仍存在偏差，导致泛化能力不足。现有基准通常只包含单一偏差，而实际应用中数据可能包含多种偏差。

Method: 提出多偏差基准，每个数据包含五种偏差；开发CMBE方法，通过因果效应估计同时消除多种偏差。

Result: 实验表明，现有LLM和去偏方法在多偏差基准上表现不佳，而CMBE能有效消除多种偏差。

Conclusion: CMBE方法能显著提升LLM的泛化能力，为多偏差消除提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, recent studies have indicated that current
large language models (LLMs) may still utilize bias during inference, leading
to the poor generalizability of LLMs. Some benchmarks are proposed to
investigate the generalizability of LLMs, with each piece of data typically
containing one type of controlled bias. However, a single piece of data may
contain multiple types of biases in practical applications. To bridge this gap,
we propose a multi-bias benchmark where each piece of data contains five types
of biases. The evaluations conducted on this benchmark reveal that the
performance of existing LLMs and debiasing methods is unsatisfying,
highlighting the challenge of eliminating multiple types of biases
simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we propose a causal effect
estimation-guided multi-bias elimination method (CMBE). This method first
estimates the causal effect of multiple types of biases simultaneously.
Subsequently, we eliminate the causal effect of biases from the total causal
effect exerted by both the semantic information and biases during inference.
Experimental results show that CMBE can effectively eliminate multiple types of
bias simultaneously to enhance the generalizability of LLMs.

TLDR: EnSToM是一种动态调整引导强度的新方法，用于提升小型大语言模型在任务导向对话系统中的主题一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型大语言模型（sLLMs）在资源受限环境中表现高效，但在任务导向对话中难以保持主题一致性，可能导致误用或可靠性问题。

Method: 提出Entropy-scaled Steering vectors for Topic Maintenance（EnSToM），根据输入不确定性动态调整引导强度。

Result: 实验表明，EnSToM在少量数据下显著提升性能，优于微调方法。

Conclusion: EnSToM在不牺牲效率的情况下，为sLLM对话系统提供了增强主题一致性的稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Small large language models (sLLMs) offer the advantage of being lightweight
and efficient, which makes them suitable for resource-constrained environments.
However, sLLMs often struggle to maintain topic consistency in task-oriented
dialogue systems, which is critical for scenarios such as service chatbots.
Specifically, it is important to ensure that the model denies off-topic or
malicious inputs and adheres to its intended functionality so as to prevent
potential misuse and uphold reliability. Towards this, existing activation
engineering approaches have been proposed to manipulate internal activations
during inference. While these methods are effective in certain scenarios, our
preliminary experiments reveal their limitations in ensuring topic adherence.
Therefore, to address this, we propose a novel approach termed Entropy-scaled
Steering vectors for Topic Maintenance (EnSToM). EnSToM dynamically adjusts the
steering intensity based on input uncertainty, which allows the model to handle
off-topic distractors effectively while preserving on-topic accuracy. Our
experiments demonstrate that EnSToM achieves significant performance gain with
a relatively small data size compared to fine-tuning approaches. By improving
topic adherence without compromising efficiency, our approach provides a robust
solution for enhancing sLLM-based dialogue systems.

Conclusion: 神经元级干预是改进多语言建模的有效方向。

Abstract: Language confusion -- where large language models (LLMs) generate unintended
languages against the user's need -- remains a critical challenge, especially
for English-centric models. We present the first mechanistic interpretability
(MI) study of language confusion, combining behavioral benchmarking with
neuron-level analysis. Using the Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB), we show
that confusion points (CPs) -- specific positions where language switches occur
-- are central to this phenomenon. Through layer-wise analysis with TunedLens
and targeted neuron attribution, we reveal that transition failures in the
final layers drive confusion. We further demonstrate that editing a small set
of critical neurons, identified via comparative analysis with
multilingual-tuned models, substantially mitigates confusion without harming
general competence or fluency. Our approach matches multilingual alignment in
confusion reduction for most languages and yields cleaner, higher-quality
outputs. These findings provide new insights into the internal dynamics of LLMs
and highlight neuron-level interventions as a promising direction for robust,
interpretable multilingual language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs中显式推理链计算成本高、效率低的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：监督微调阶段预测压缩嵌入，强化学习阶段探索多样化推理路径。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，CoLaR比基线方法准确率提升14.1%，推理链长度减少53.3%。

Conclusion: CoLaR在保持性能的同时显著提升推理效率，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but these token-level reasoning chains are
computationally expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce
Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically
compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training
approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token
prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction
objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a
compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a
specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed
embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that
leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse
reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to:
i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially
reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at
inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive
experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR
achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable
compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8%
performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied
to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR
demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent
reasoning chain length by 82.8%. The code and models will be released upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: ScholarBench为评估LLMs在复杂学术任务中的能力提供了有效工具，并展示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Prior benchmarks for evaluating the domain-specific knowledge of large
language models (LLMs) lack the scalability to handle complex academic tasks.
To address this, we introduce \texttt{ScholarBench}, a benchmark centered on
deep expert knowledge and complex academic problem-solving, which evaluates the
academic reasoning ability of LLMs and is constructed through a three-step
process. \texttt{ScholarBench} targets more specialized and logically complex
contexts derived from academic literature, encompassing five distinct problem
types. Unlike prior benchmarks, \texttt{ScholarBench} evaluates the
abstraction, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs across eight
distinct research domains. To ensure high-quality evaluation data, we define
category-specific example attributes and design questions that are aligned with
the characteristic research methodologies and discourse structures of each
domain. Additionally, this benchmark operates as an English-Korean bilingual
dataset, facilitating simultaneous evaluation for linguistic capabilities of
LLMs in both languages. The benchmark comprises 5,031 examples in Korean and
5,309 in English, with even state-of-the-art models like o3-mini achieving an
average evaluation score of only 0.543, demonstrating the challenging nature of
this benchmark.

TLDR: 研究发现，并非所有元数据类型对LLM训练和性能提升都有效，仅URL上下文能加速训练，而质量评分和主题/格式信息无明显帮助。URL条件化仅在长提示下提升下游性能，且上下文感知预训练能实现更可控的生成。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨元数据（如URL、质量评分、主题/格式）对LLM训练效率和下游性能的影响，以优化上下文感知预训练。

Method: 系统评估不同元数据类型对训练效率和下游任务表现的影响，分析其在生成控制中的作用。

Result: URL上下文加速训练，但仅长提示下提升性能；主题/格式元数据虽不加速训练，但可用于生成控制。

Conclusion: 元数据选择需针对性，URL对训练效率有效，主题/格式对生成控制有用，但需注意应用条件。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly pretrained on vast corpora of text
without utilizing contextual metadata such as source, quality, or topic,
leading to a context-free learning paradigm. While recent studies suggest that
adding metadata like URL information as context (i.e., auxiliary inputs not
used in the loss calculation) can improve training efficiency and downstream
performance, they offer limited understanding of which types of metadata are
truly effective and under what conditions. In this work, we conduct a
systematic evaluation and find that not all metadata types contribute equally.
Only URL context speeds up training, whereas quality scores and topic/format
domain information offer no clear benefit. Furthermore, the improved downstream
performances of URL conditioning emerge only when longer prompts are used at
inference time. In addition, we demonstrate that context-aware pretraining
enables more controllable generation than context-free pretraining, in a
classifier-free guidance fashion. Although topic and format metadata do not
accelerate training, they are effective for steering outputs, offering
human-interpretable control over generation.

Motivation: 现有的事实核查系统通过检索证据并分类的方式与人类行为不符，需要更接近人类的方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，验证了多智能体框架的有效性。

Conclusion: EMULATE系统通过模拟人类行为，显著提升了事实核查的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Determining the veracity of atomic claims is an imperative component of many
recently proposed fact-checking systems. Many approaches tackle this problem by
first retrieving evidence by querying a search engine and then performing
classification by providing the evidence set and atomic claim to a large
language model, but this process deviates from what a human would do in order
to perform the task. Recent work attempted to address this issue by proposing
iterative evidence retrieval, allowing for evidence to be collected several
times and only when necessary. Continuing along this line of research, we
propose a novel claim verification system, called EMULATE, which is designed to
better emulate human actions through the use of a multi-agent framework where
each agent performs a small part of the larger task, such as ranking search
results according to predefined criteria or evaluating webpage content.
Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show clear improvements over prior
work, demonstrating the efficacy of our new multi-agent framework.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）受限于静态参数知识，难以处理需要开放域最新信息的任务，尤其是开放性问题。

Method: 提出O²-Searcher，利用强化学习在本地模拟搜索环境中动态获取知识，并通过统一训练机制和奖励函数适应不同问题类型。

Result: O²-Searcher在O²-QA基准上显著优于其他LLM代理，并在封闭性问题基准上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: O²-Searcher通过动态知识获取和适应性策略，有效解决了开放性和封闭性问题，展示了其在开放域任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advancements, are fundamentally
limited by their static parametric knowledge, hindering performance on tasks
requiring open-domain up-to-date information. While enabling LLMs to interact
with external knowledge environments is a promising solution, current efforts
primarily address closed-end problems. Open-ended questions, which
characterized by lacking a standard answer or providing non-unique and diverse
answers, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present O$^2$-Searcher, a
novel search agent leveraging reinforcement learning to effectively tackle both
open-ended and closed-ended questions in the open domain. O$^2$-Searcher
leverages an efficient, locally simulated search environment for dynamic
knowledge acquisition, effectively decoupling the external world knowledge from
model's sophisticated reasoning processes. It employs a unified training
mechanism with meticulously designed reward functions, enabling the agent to
identify problem types and adapt different answer generation strategies.
Furthermore, to evaluate performance on complex open-ended tasks, we construct
O$^2$-QA, a high-quality benchmark featuring 300 manually curated, multi-domain
open-ended questions with associated web page caches. Extensive experiments
show that O$^2$-Searcher, using only a 3B model, significantly surpasses
leading LLM agents on O$^2$-QA. It also achieves SOTA results on various
closed-ended QA benchmarks against similarly-sized models, while performing on
par with much larger ones.

Conclusion: KoLasSimpleQA有助于识别LLM在多语言环境中的能力边界，并为模型优化提供指导。

Abstract: We introduce KoLasSimpleQA, the first benchmark evaluating the multilingual
factual ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by existing research,
we created the question set with features such as single knowledge point
coverage, absolute objectivity, unique answers, and temporal stability. These
questions enable efficient evaluation using the LLM-as-judge paradigm, testing
both the LLMs' factual memory and self-awareness ("know what they don't know").
KoLasSimpleQA expands existing research in two key dimensions: (1) Breadth
(Multilingual Coverage): It includes 9 languages, supporting global
applicability evaluation. (2) Depth (Dual Domain Design): It covers both the
general domain (global facts) and the language-specific domain (such as
history, culture, and regional traditions) for a comprehensive assessment of
multilingual capabilities. We evaluated mainstream LLMs, including traditional
LLM and emerging Large Reasoning Models. Results show significant performance
differences between the two domains, particularly in performance metrics,
ranking, calibration, and robustness. This highlights the need for targeted
evaluation and optimization in multilingual contexts. We hope KoLasSimpleQA
will help the research community better identify LLM capability boundaries in
multilingual contexts and provide guidance for model optimization. We will
release KoLasSimpleQA at https://github.com/opendatalab/KoLasSimpleQA .

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs在处理气候变迁迷因中复杂框架和立场表达时的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Media framing refers to the emphasis on specific aspects of perceived reality
to shape how an issue is defined and understood. Its primary purpose is to
shape public perceptions often in alignment with the authors' opinions and
stances. However, the interaction between stance and media frame remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we apply an interdisciplinary approach to
conceptualize and computationally explore this interaction with internet memes
on climate change. We curate CLIMATEMEMES, the first dataset of climate-change
memes annotated with both stance and media frames, inspired by research in
communication science. CLIMATEMEMES includes 1,184 memes sourced from 47
subreddits, enabling analysis of frame prominence over time and communities,
and sheds light on the framing preferences of different stance holders. We
propose two meme understanding tasks: stance detection and media frame
detection. We evaluate LLaVA-NeXT and Molmo in various setups, and report the
corresponding results on their LLM backbone. Human captions consistently
enhance performance. Synthetic captions and human-corrected OCR also help
occasionally. Our findings highlight that VLMs perform well on stance, but
struggle on frames, where LLMs outperform VLMs. Finally, we analyze VLMs'
limitations in handling nuanced frames and stance expressions on climate change
internet memes.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升情感支持性能，减少无用回复和用户偏好与模型输出的差异。

Conclusion: 自我进化框架有效提升LLMs在情感支持中的个性化能力。

Abstract: Effective emotional support hinges on understanding users' emotions and needs
to provide meaningful comfort during multi-turn interactions. Large Language
Models (LLMs) show great potential for expressing empathy; however, they often
deliver generic and one-size-fits-all responses that fail to address users'
specific needs. To tackle this issue, we propose a self-evolution framework
designed to help LLMs improve their responses to better align with users'
implicit preferences concerning user profiles (personalities), emotional
states, and specific situations. Our framework consists of two distinct phases:
\textit{(1)} \textit{Emotional Support Experience Acquisition}, where LLMs are
fine-tuned on limited emotional support conversation data to provide basic
support, and \textit{(2)} \textit{Self-Improvement for Personalized Emotional
Support}, where LLMs leverage self-reflection and self-refinement to generate
personalized responses. Through iterative direct preference optimization
between the pre- and post-refined responses, our model generates responses that
reflect a better understanding of the user's implicit preferences. Extensive
experiments and evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly enhances
the model's performance in emotional support, reducing unhelpful responses and
minimizing discrepancies between user preferences and model outputs.

Abstract: High-quality machine translation systems based on large language models
(LLMs) have simplified the production of personalized translations reflecting
specific stylistic constraints. However, these systems still struggle in
settings where stylistic requirements are less explicit and might be harder to
convey via prompting. We explore various strategies for personalizing
LLM-generated translations in low-resource settings, focusing on the
challenging literary translation domain. We explore prompting strategies and
inference-time interventions for steering model generations towards a
personalized style, and propose a contrastive framework exploiting latent
concepts extracted from sparse autoencoders to identify salient personalization
properties. Our results show that steering achieves strong personalization
while preserving translation quality. We further examine the impact of steering
on LLM representations, finding model layers with a relevant impact for
personalization are impacted similarly by multi-shot prompting and our steering
method, suggesting similar mechanism at play.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in machine translation (MT). However, most advanced MT-specific
LLMs heavily rely on external supervision signals during training, such as
human-annotated reference data or trained reward models (RMs), which are often
expensive to obtain and challenging to scale. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for
MT that is reference-free, fully online, and relies solely on self-judging
rewards. Training with SSR using 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B as
the backbone, our model SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing MT-specific LLMs,
e.g., TowerInstruct-13B and GemmaX-28-9B, as well as larger general LLMs like
Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation tasks
from WMT23, WMT24, and Flores200 benchmarks. Furthermore, by augmenting SSR
with external supervision from COMET, our strongest model, SSR-X-Zero-7B,
achieves state-of-the-art performance in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese
translation, surpassing all existing open-source models under 72B parameters
and even outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.
Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the self-rewarding mechanism
compared to the external LLM-as-a-judge approach in MT and demonstrates its
complementary benefits when combined with trained RMs. Our findings provide
valuable insight into the potential of self-improving RL methods. We have
publicly released our code, data and models.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges in intelligent processing of Chinese
ancient mathematical classics by constructing Guji_MATH, a benchmark for
evaluating classical texts based on Suanjing Shishu. It systematically assesses
the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of mainstream reasoning models
under the unique linguistic constraints of classical Chinese. Through
machine-assisted annotation and manual verification, 538 mathematical problems
were extracted from 8 canonical texts, forming a structured dataset centered on
the "Question-Answer-Solution" framework, supplemented by problem types and
difficulty levels. Dual evaluation modes--closed-book (autonomous
problem-solving) and open-book (reproducing classical solution methods)--were
designed to evaluate the performance of six reasoning models on ancient Chinese
mathematical problems. Results indicate that reasoning models can partially
comprehend and solve these problems, yet their overall performance remains
inferior to benchmarks on modern mathematical tasks. Enhancing models'
classical Chinese comprehension and cultural knowledge should be prioritized
for optimization. This study provides methodological support for mining
mathematical knowledge from ancient texts and disseminating traditional
culture, while offering new perspectives for evaluating cross-linguistic and
cross-cultural capabilities of reasoning models.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种针对日本制药领域的特定领域语言模型，通过持续预训练开发，并在三个新基准测试中评估其性能。模型在术语密集和知识型任务上表现优异，甚至在某些任务上优于商业模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发适用于日本制药领域的语言模型，填补现有模型在专业领域的不足，并提供可复用的评估资源。

Method: 通过持续预训练2亿日语制药标记和80亿英语生物医学标记开发模型，并引入三个新基准测试（YakugakuQA、NayoseQA、SogoCheck）进行严格评估。

Result: 模型在术语密集和知识型任务上优于现有开源模型，并与商业模型竞争。GPT-4o在SogoCheck任务上表现不佳，显示跨句一致性推理仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了构建实用、安全且经济高效的日本特定领域语言模型的可行性，并为制药和医疗NLP提供了可复用的评估资源。

Abstract: We present a Japanese domain-specific language model for the pharmaceutical
field, developed through continual pretraining on 2 billion Japanese
pharmaceutical tokens and 8 billion English biomedical tokens. To enable
rigorous evaluation, we introduce three new benchmarks: YakugakuQA, based on
national pharmacist licensing exams; NayoseQA, which tests cross-lingual
synonym and terminology normalization; and SogoCheck, a novel task designed to
assess consistency reasoning between paired statements. We evaluate our model
against both open-source medical LLMs and commercial models, including GPT-4o.
Results show that our domain-specific model outperforms existing open models
and achieves competitive performance with commercial ones, particularly on
terminology-heavy and knowledge-based tasks. Interestingly, even GPT-4o
performs poorly on SogoCheck, suggesting that cross-sentence consistency
reasoning remains an open challenge. Our benchmark suite offers a broader
diagnostic lens for pharmaceutical NLP, covering factual recall, lexical
variation, and logical consistency. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
building practical, secure, and cost-effective language models for Japanese
domain-specific applications, and provides reusable evaluation resources for
future research in pharmaceutical and healthcare NLP. Our model, codes, and
datasets are released at https://github.com/EQUES-Inc/pharma-LLM-eval.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了Transformer语言模型如何通过训练动态获得元学习能力，而非仅复制上下文中的答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型如何从上下文中元学习任务解决能力，填补了现有研究仅关注复制答案的空白。

Method: 通过扩展复制任务为上下文元学习设置，分析模型训练过程中电路动态变化。

Result: 发现元学习能力获取分为多个阶段，每个阶段出现独特电路，与单阶段变化的归纳头形成对比。

Conclusion: 揭示了Transformer上下文学习能力的来源，为理解其元学习机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), where
predictions are made adaptively based on context. While prior work links
induction heads to ICL through a sudden jump in accuracy, this can only account
for ICL when the answer is included within the context. However, an important
property of practical ICL in large language models is the ability to meta-learn
how to solve tasks from context, rather than just copying answers from context;
how such an ability is obtained during training is largely unexplored. In this
paper, we experimentally clarify how such meta-learning ability is acquired by
analyzing the dynamics of the model's circuit during training. Specifically, we
extend the copy task from previous research into an In-Context Meta Learning
setting, where models must infer a task from examples to answer queries.
Interestingly, in this setting, we find that there are multiple phases in the
process of acquiring such abilities, and that a unique circuit emerges in each
phase, contrasting with the single-phases change in induction heads. The
emergence of such circuits can be related to several phenomena known in large
language models, and our analysis lead to a deeper understanding of the source
of the transformer's ICL ability.

TLDR: 论文提出Locate-then-Merge框架和Neuron-Fusion策略，通过选择性融合参数解决多模态指令调优中的语言能力遗忘问题，实验表明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在指令调优阶段常导致基础语言能力的灾难性遗忘，即使是Llama3等强模型也不例外。

Method: 提出训练无关的参数融合框架Locate-then-Merge，结合Neuron-Fusion策略，选择性融合重要参数并保留视觉能力相关的神经元。

Result: 在13个语言和视觉任务基准测试中，Neuron-Fusion表现优于现有模型融合方法，并有效减少生成中的上下文幻觉。

Conclusion: 该方法在保留视觉适应能力的同时缓解了语言能力的退化，为多模态模型优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive
performance, the multimodal instruction tuning stage often causes catastrophic
forgetting of the base LLM's language ability, even in strong models like
Llama3. To address this, we propose Locate-then-Merge, a training-free
parameter fusion framework that first locates important parameters and then
selectively merges them. We further introduce Neuron-Fusion, a neuron-level
strategy that preserves the influence of neurons with large parameter
shifts--neurons likely responsible for newly acquired visual
capabilities--while attenuating the influence of neurons with smaller changes
that likely encode general-purpose language skills. This design enables better
retention of visual adaptation while mitigating language degradation.
Experiments on 13 benchmarks across both language and visual tasks show that
Neuron-Fusion consistently outperforms existing model merging methods. Further
analysis reveals that our method effectively reduces context hallucination in
generation.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在全球应用中的普及，确保其在多语言环境中无毒化成为关键挑战。

Method: 提出跨语言去毒化范式，通过有限数据评估毒性减少效果，并研究其对非毒性任务性能的影响。

Result: 在跨分布设置中验证了去毒化的有效性，揭示了安全性与知识保留之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 跨语言去毒化是可行的，但需平衡安全性与模型性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in global
applications, ensuring that they are toxicity-free across diverse linguistic
contexts remains a critical challenge. We explore "Cross-lingual
Detoxification", a cross-lingual paradigm that mitigates toxicity, enabling
detoxification capabilities to transfer between high and low-resource languages
across different script families. We analyze cross-lingual detoxification's
effectiveness through 504 extensive settings to evaluate toxicity reduction in
cross-distribution settings with limited data and investigate how mitigation
impacts model performance on non-toxic tasks, revealing trade-offs between
safety and knowledge preservation. Our code and dataset are publicly available

*Florentin Beck,William Rudman,Carsten Eickhoff*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: TRIM是一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）的新型剪枝方法，通过逐行调整稀疏度，显著提升了模型在高稀疏率下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一刀切剪枝方法在高稀疏率下性能不佳，需要更精细的稀疏度分配策略。

Method: TRIM采用基于质量指标的迭代调整过程，为每层中的输出维度（行）分配不同的稀疏度。

Result: 在80%稀疏率下，TRIM显著降低了困惑度（如Qwen2.5-14B降低48%，OPT-13B降低90%以上）。

Conclusion: 精细的维度稀疏度调整是极端LLM压缩的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant computational and memory
challenges due to their extensive size, making pruning essential for their
efficient deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods often apply uniform
sparsity constraints across layers or within each layer, resulting in
suboptimal performance, especially at high sparsity ratios. This work
introduces TRIM (Targeted Row-wise Iterative Metric-driven pruning), a novel
approach that applies varying sparsity ratios to individual output dimensions
(rows) within each layer. TRIM employs an iterative adjustment process guided
by quality metrics to optimize dimension-wise sparsity allocation, focusing on
reducing variance in quality retention across outputs to preserve critical
information. TRIM can be seamlessly integrated with existing layer-wise pruning
strategies. Our evaluations on perplexity and zero-shot tasks across diverse
LLM families (Qwen2.5, LLaMA-2, and OPT) and sparsity levels demonstrate that
TRIM achieves new state-of-the-art results and enhances stability. For
instance, at 80% sparsity, TRIM reduces perplexity by 48% for Qwen2.5-14B and
over 90% for OPT-13B compared to baseline methods. We conclude that
fine-grained, dimension-wise sparsity adaptation is crucial for pushing the
limits of extreme LLM compression. Code available at:

TLDR: 论文介绍了IFEval-Audio数据集，用于评估音频大语言模型（LLM）的指令跟随能力，填补了该领域的研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型在非文本模态（如图像或音频）对齐后，指令跟随能力常下降，而音频LLM的指令跟随能力尚未被充分研究。

Method: 构建IFEval-Audio数据集，包含280个音频-指令-答案三元组，覆盖六个维度，用于评估音频LLM的指令跟随能力。

Result: 数据集公开，并用于对现有音频LLM进行基准测试。

Conclusion: IFEval-Audio填补了音频LLM指令跟随能力评估的空白，支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong instruction-following
capabilities in text-based tasks. However, this ability often deteriorates in
multimodal models after alignment with non-text modalities such as images or
audio. While several recent efforts have investigated instruction-following
performance in text and vision-language models, instruction-following in
audio-based large language models remains largely unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we introduce IFEval-Audio, a novel evaluation dataset designed to assess
the ability to follow instructions in an audio LLM. IFEval-Audio contains 280
audio-instruction-answer triples across six diverse dimensions: Content,
Capitalization, Symbol, List Structure, Length, and Format. Each example pairs
an audio input with a text instruction, requiring the model to generate an
output that follows a specified structure. We benchmark state-of-the-art audio
LLMs on their ability to follow audio-involved instructions. The dataset is
released publicly to support future research in this emerging area.

Conclusion: 潜在CoT是一个有前景的研究方向，未来可通过优化训练方法、结构创新和推理机制进一步推动其发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, conventional
CoT relies on reasoning steps explicitly verbalized in natural language,
introducing inefficiencies and limiting its applicability to abstract
reasoning. To address this, there has been growing research interest in latent
CoT reasoning, where inference occurs within latent spaces. By decoupling
reasoning from language, latent reasoning promises richer cognitive
representations and more flexible, faster inference. Researchers have explored
various directions in this promising field, including training methodologies,
structural innovations, and internal reasoning mechanisms. This paper presents
a comprehensive overview and analysis of this reasoning paradigm. We begin by
proposing a unified taxonomy from four perspectives: token-wise strategies,
internal mechanisms, analysis, and applications. We then provide in-depth
discussions and comparative analyses of representative methods, highlighting
their design patterns, strengths, and open challenges. We aim to provide a
structured foundation for advancing this emerging direction in LLM reasoning.

Abstract: As large language models gain popularity, their vulnerability to adversarial
attacks remains a primary concern. While fine-tuning models on domain-specific
datasets is often employed to improve model performance, it can introduce
vulnerabilities within the underlying model. In this work, we investigate
Accidental Misalignment, unexpected vulnerabilities arising from
characteristics of fine-tuning data. We begin by identifying potential
correlation factors such as linguistic features, semantic similarity, and
toxicity within our experimental datasets. We then evaluate the adversarial
performance of these fine-tuned models and assess how dataset factors correlate
with attack success rates. Lastly, we explore potential causal links, offering
new insights into adversarial defense strategies and highlighting the crucial
role of dataset design in preserving model alignment. Our code is available at

To further address data scarcity, we integrate synthetic training data

Method: 提出TW-ESA模块实现证据自对齐，DGR模块融合LLM知识进行推理增强，两者协同训练。

Result: 在三个数据集上，ESA-DGR显著优于现有方法，EM和F1分别提升4%和5%。

Conclusion: ESA-DGR通过证据对齐和知识融合，有效提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encounter difficulties in knowledge-intensive
multi-step reasoning (KIMSR) tasks. One challenge is how to effectively extract
and represent rationale evidence. The current methods often extract
semantically relevant but logically irrelevant evidence, resulting in flawed
reasoning and inaccurate responses. We propose a two-way evidence
self-alignment (TW-ESA) module, which utilizes the mutual alignment between
strict reasoning and LLM reasoning to enhance its understanding of the causal
logic of evidence, thereby addressing the first challenge. Another challenge is
how to utilize the rationale evidence and LLM's intrinsic knowledge for
accurate reasoning when the evidence contains uncertainty. We propose a
dual-gated reasoning enhancement (DGR) module to gradually fuse useful
knowledge of LLM within strict reasoning, which can enable the model to perform
accurate reasoning by focusing on causal elements in the evidence and exhibit
greater robustness. The two modules are collaboratively trained in a unified
framework ESA-DGR. Extensive experiments on three diverse and challenging KIMSR
datasets reveal that ESA-DGR significantly surpasses state-of-the-art LLM-based
fine-tuning methods, with remarkable average improvements of 4% in exact match
(EM) and 5% in F1 score. The implementation code is available at

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition(NER) for low-resource languages aims to produce
robust systems for languages where there is limited labeled training data
available, and has been an area of increasing interest within NLP. Data
augmentation for increasing the amount of low-resource labeled data is a common
practice. In this paper, we explore the role of synthetic data in the context
of multilingual, low-resource NER, considering 11 languages from diverse
language families. Our results suggest that synthetic data does in fact hold
promise for low-resource language NER, though we see significant variation
between languages.

Method: 引入基于PCA相似性、中心核对齐和Fisher信息的表示层面评估工具包，分析六种遗忘方法、三种领域和两种开源LLM。

Result: 发现可逆遗忘中模型保留潜在特征，而不可逆遗忘中表示层受损；任务类型和超参数调节可逆性。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法存在根本缺陷，需建立新的诊断基础以确保LLM遗忘的可信度，并提供了分析工具包。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is intended to remove the
influence of specific data, yet current evaluations rely heavily on token-level
metrics such as accuracy and perplexity. We show that these metrics can be
misleading: models often appear to forget, but their original behavior can be
rapidly restored with minimal fine-tuning, revealing that unlearning may
obscure information rather than erase it. To diagnose this phenomenon, we
introduce a representation-level evaluation framework using PCA-based
similarity and shift, centered kernel alignment, and Fisher information.
Applying this toolkit across six unlearning methods, three domains (text, code,
math), and two open-source LLMs, we uncover a critical distinction between
reversible and irreversible forgetting. In reversible cases, models suffer
token-level collapse yet retain latent features; in irreversible cases, deeper
representational damage occurs. We further provide a theoretical account
linking shallow weight perturbations near output layers to misleading
unlearning signals, and show that reversibility is modulated by task type and
hyperparameters. Our findings reveal a fundamental gap in current evaluation
practices and establish a new diagnostic foundation for trustworthy unlearning
in LLMs. We provide a unified toolkit for analyzing LLM representation changes
under unlearning and relearning:

Conclusion: SFT通过系统性解决数据稀缺问题，为高效深度搜索系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have advanced large language
models (LLMs) in complex deep search scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning
and iterative information retrieval. However, existing approaches face critical
limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the
distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive
computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces
SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap
through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our
approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user
interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria
curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output
side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that
SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based
baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically
addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for
efficient deep search systems. Our code is available at

TLDR: R1-Compress是一种两阶段分块级压缩框架，用于减少Long-CoT的计算开销，同时保持推理准确性和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-CoT因增加令牌长度而带来计算开销，现有压缩方法会牺牲局部推理信号或产生不连贯输出。

Method: R1-Compress将Long-CoT分段，应用LLM驱动的块内压缩，并通过块间搜索选择短且连贯的序列。

Result: 在MATH500上，R1-Compress准确率为92.4%，令牌使用减少20%，仅比Long-CoT基线下降0.6%。

Conclusion: R1-Compress有效减少了令牌使用，同时保持了推理准确性，优于现有压缩方法。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances large language models (LLMs) by
enabling step-by-step problem-solving, yet its extension to Long-CoT introduces
substantial computational overhead due to increased token length. Existing
compression approaches -- instance-level and token-level -- either sacrifice
essential local reasoning signals like reflection or yield incoherent outputs.
To address these limitations, we propose R1-Compress, a two-stage chunk-level
compression framework that preserves both local information and coherence. Our
method segments Long-CoT into manageable chunks, applies LLM-driven inner-chunk
compression, and employs an inter-chunk search mechanism to select the short
and coherent sequence. Experiments on Qwen2.5-Instruct models across MATH500,
AIME24, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that R1-Compress significantly reduces
token usage while maintaining comparable reasoning accuracy. On MATH500,
R1-Compress achieves an accuracy of 92.4%, with only a 0.6% drop compared to
the Long-CoT baseline, while reducing token usage by about 20%. Source code

We perform a comparative analysis of annotations from human experts, crowd
annotators, and ChatGPT, revealing strengths and limitations of each method in
recognizing both explicit hate speech and subtler discriminatory language. Our
findings highlight the significant role of contextual factors in identifying
hate speech and uncover new categories of targeting, such as social belief and
body image. We also address the challenges and subjective judgments involved in
annotation and the limitations of ChatGPT in grasping nuanced language. This

Method: 利用选区结构线性化和预训练编码器，将嵌套实体识别转化为只需n次标注动作的任务。

Result: 方法性能与低效系统相当，且可使用现成的序列标注库训练。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且易于实现，适用于嵌套命名实体识别任务。

Abstract: We cast nested named entity recognition (NNER) as a sequence labeling task by
leveraging prior work that linearizes constituency structures, effectively
reducing the complexity of this structured prediction problem to
straightforward token classification. By combining these constituency
linearizations with pretrained encoders, our method captures nested entities
while performing exactly $n$ tagging actions. Our approach achieves competitive
performance compared to less efficient systems, and it can be trained using any
off-the-shelf sequence labeling library.

Abstract: Tokenization is the act of breaking down text into smaller parts, or tokens,
that are easier for machines to process. This is a key phase in machine
translation (MT) models. Subword tokenization enhances this process by breaking
down words into smaller subword units, which is especially beneficial in
languages with complicated morphology or a vast vocabulary. It is useful in
capturing the intricate structure of words in Indian languages (ILs), such as
prefixes, suffixes, and other morphological variations. These languages
frequently use agglutinative structures, in which words are formed by the
combination of multiple morphemes such as suffixes, prefixes, and stems. As a
result, a suitable tokenization strategy must be chosen to address these
scenarios. This paper examines how different subword tokenization techniques,
such as SentencePiece, Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), and WordPiece Tokenization,
affect ILs. The effectiveness of these subword tokenization techniques is
investigated in statistical, neural, and multilingual neural machine
translation models. All models are examined using standard evaluation metrics,
such as the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score, TER, METEOR, CHRF,
RIBES, and COMET. Based on the results, it appears that for the majority of
language pairs for the Statistical and Neural MT models, the SentencePiece
tokenizer continuously performed better than other tokenizers in terms of BLEU
score. However, BPE tokenization outperformed other tokenization techniques in
the context of Multilingual Neural Machine Translation model. The results show
that, despite using the same tokenizer and dataset for each model, translations
from ILs to English surpassed translations from English to ILs.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为MPO的新方法，用于改进多语言大模型的安全对齐，通过最小化主导语言与目标语言之间的奖励差距，有效提升多语言安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法（如RLHF和DPO）主要针对单语言，难以处理多语言噪声数据，亟需一种能跨语言有效对齐安全性的方法。

Method: MPO方法通过最小化主导语言（英语）与目标语言之间的奖励差距，直接优化多语言安全对齐，同时保留主导语言的原有优势。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1、Gemma-2和Qwen2.5三个大模型上的实验表明，MPO能有效提升多语言安全性，且不影响多语言通用性能。

Conclusion: MPO是一种高效的多语言安全对齐方法，适用于全球部署的大模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to AI
applications worldwide, necessitating robust multilingual safety alignment to
ensure secure deployment across diverse linguistic contexts. Existing
preference learning methods for safety alignment, such as RLHF and DPO, are
primarily monolingual and struggle with noisy multilingual data. To address
these limitations, we introduce Multilingual reward gaP Optimization (MPO), a
novel approach that leverages the well-aligned safety capabilities of the
dominant language (English) to improve safety alignment across multiple
languages. MPO directly minimizes the reward gap difference between the
dominant language and target languages, effectively transferring safety
capabilities while preserving the original strengths of the dominant language.
Extensive experiments on three LLMs, LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2 and Qwen2.5, validate
MPO's efficacy in multilingual safety alignment without degrading general
multilingual utility.

*Daniel F. Perez-Ramirez,Dejan Kostic,Magnus Boman*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: CASTILLO是一个数据集，用于分析13种开源大语言模型（LLM）在7种指令遵循语料库上的响应长度分布，揭示了模型间和模型内的显著变异性，为资源调度提供了预测模型的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自回归文本生成的随机性和变长性，高效管理LLM推理的计算资源具有挑战性。现有方法要么偏向特定长度，要么忽略模型和提示的变异性。

Method: 通过固定解码超参数为每个〈提示，模型〉样本对生成10个独立完成，记录响应长度并发布统计数据和生成设置。

Result: 分析显示响应长度在模型间和模型内存在显著变异性，以及模型特定行为和部分文本退化现象。

Conclusion: CASTILLO为预测模型开发和资源调度提供了系统框架，并公开数据集和代码以促进研究。

Abstract: Efficiently managing compute resources for Large Language Model (LLM)
inference remains challenging due to the inherently stochastic and variable
lengths of autoregressive text generation. Accurately estimating response
lengths in advance enables proactive resource allocation, yet existing
approaches either bias text generation towards certain lengths or rely on
assumptions that ignore model- and prompt-specific variability. We introduce
CASTILLO, a dataset characterizing response length distributions across 13
widely-used open-source LLMs evaluated on seven distinct instruction-following
corpora. For each $\langle$prompt, model$\rangle$ sample pair, we generate 10
independent completions using fixed decoding hyper-parameters, record the token
length of each response, and publish summary statistics (mean, std-dev,
percentiles), along with the shortest and longest completions, and the exact
generation settings. Our analysis reveals significant inter- and intra-model
variability in response lengths (even under identical generation settings), as
well as model-specific behaviors and occurrences of partial text degeneration
in only subsets of responses. CASTILLO enables the development of predictive
models for proactive scheduling and provides a systematic framework for
analyzing model-specific generation behaviors. We publicly release the dataset
and code to foster research at the intersection of generative language modeling
and systems.

TLDR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）中幻觉现象与上下文注入引起的内状态漂移的关系，揭示了幻觉频率与漂移的动态关系及其机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉（看似合理但错误的输出）是LLM可靠部署的主要障碍，研究旨在揭示其与上下文注入引起的内状态漂移的联系。

Method: 使用TruthfulQA构建两种16轮“滴定”实验，分别注入相关但有缺陷的片段和误导性内容，通过多视角检测器和多种漂移指标分析幻觉动态。

Result: 发现幻觉频率随轮次单调增长并在5-7轮后趋于稳定；相关上下文导致高置信度的“自洽”幻觉，无关上下文引发主题漂移错误；JS和Spearman漂移收敛标志幻觉固化的阈值。

Conclusion: 研究为幻觉预测和上下文感知缓解机制提供了实证基础，揭示了模型大小与错误模式的关联。

Abstract: Hallucinations -- plausible yet erroneous outputs -- remain a critical
barrier to reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). We present the
first systematic study linking hallucination incidence to internal-state drift
induced by incremental context injection. Using TruthfulQA, we construct two
16-round "titration" tracks per question: one appends relevant but partially
flawed snippets, the other injects deliberately misleading content. Across six
open-source LLMs, we track overt hallucination rates with a tri-perspective
detector and covert dynamics via cosine, entropy, JS and Spearman drifts of
hidden states and attention maps. Results reveal (1) monotonic growth of
hallucination frequency and representation drift that plateaus after 5--7
rounds; (2) relevant context drives deeper semantic assimilation, producing
high-confidence "self-consistent" hallucinations, whereas irrelevant context
induces topic-drift errors anchored by attention re-routing; and (3)
convergence of JS-Drift ($\sim0.69$) and Spearman-Drift ($\sim0$) marks an
"attention-locking" threshold beyond which hallucinations solidify and become
resistant to correction. Correlation analyses expose a seesaw between
assimilation capacity and attention diffusion, clarifying size-dependent error
modes. These findings supply empirical foundations for intrinsic hallucination
prediction and context-aware mitigation mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文提出了一种新的损失函数PDL，通过根据词频重新加权标准交叉熵损失，优化文本生成任务的微调过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准交叉熵损失对所有词元平等对待，导致模型过度关注高频低信息词元，而忽视低频高信息词元。PDL的动机源于信息论和语言学观察：词元的信息量通常与其出现频率成反比。

Method: PDL基于训练语料库中词元的频率，按幂律衰减重新加权标准交叉熵损失，减少高频词元的权重，增加低频高信息词元的权重。

Result: PDL引导模型在微调过程中更关注学习生成具有特定和独特信息的词元，从而提升生成文本的质量、多样性和信息量。

Conclusion: PDL在抽象摘要、对话系统和风格转换等文本生成任务中具有潜在应用和优势。

Abstract: During the finetuning stage of text generation tasks, standard cross-entropy
loss treats all tokens equally. This can lead models to overemphasize
high-frequency, low-information tokens, neglecting lower-frequency tokens
crucial for specificity and informativeness in generated content. This paper
introduces a novel loss function, Power-Law Decay Loss (PDL), specifically
designed to optimize the finetuning process for text generation. The core
motivation for PDL stems from observations in information theory and
linguistics: the informativeness of a token is often inversely proportional to
its frequency of occurrence. PDL re-weights the contribution of each token in
the standard cross-entropy loss based on its frequency in the training corpus,
following a power-law decay. Specifically, the weights for high-frequency
tokens are reduced, while low-frequency, information-dense tokens are assigned
higher weights. This mechanism guides the model during finetuning to focus more
on learning and generating tokens that convey specific and unique information,
thereby enhancing the quality, diversity, and informativeness of the generated
text. We theoretically elaborate on the motivation and construction of PDL and
discuss its potential applications and advantages across various text
generation finetuning tasks, such as abstractive summarization, dialogue
systems, and style transfer.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文介绍了UNCLE基准，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在长、短形式问答中表达不确定性的能力，并发现当前模型在长形式生成中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在长形式生成中易产生幻觉的问题，并缺乏对其不确定性表达能力的直接评估。

Method: 提出UNCLE基准，包含5个领域的4k长形式QA实例和20k短形式QA对，并设计新指标评估模型能力。

Result: 当前模型在长形式生成中无法有效表达不确定性，训练方法比提示方法改进效果更显著。

Conclusion: UNCLE为未来研究提供了方向，揭示了短、长形式不确定性表达之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, particularly in
long-form generations. A promising direction to mitigate hallucination is to
teach LLMs to express uncertainty explicitly when they lack sufficient
knowledge. However, existing work lacks direct and fair evaluation of LLMs'
ability to express uncertainty effectively in long-form generation. To address
this gap, we first introduce UNCLE, a benchmark designed to evaluate
uncertainty expression in both long- and short-form question answering (QA).
UNCLE spans five domains and comprises 4k long-form QA instances and over 20k
short-form QA pairs. Our dataset is the first to directly bridge short- and
long-form QA with paired questions and gold-standard answers. Along with the
benchmark, we propose a suite of new metrics to assess the models' capabilities
to selectively express uncertainty. Using UNCLE, we then demonstrate that
current models fail to convey uncertainty appropriately in long-form
generation. We further explore both prompt-based and training-based methods to
improve models' performance, with the training-based methods yielding greater
gains. Further analysis of alignment gaps between short- and long-form
uncertainty expression highlights promising directions for future research
using UNCLE.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种自动化方法，通过自校正设置从语言模型中提取潜在行为属性，并通过聚类压缩为可解释的集合，从而提升模型生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要人工标注行为属性，耗时耗力。本文旨在自动化这一过程，通过模型自身挖掘和优化潜在原则。

Method: 采用后验正则化的蒙特卡洛期望最大化方法，识别有效潜在原则并指导模型策略性调用，实现自我改进。

Result: 实验表明，该方法使较小模型性能显著提升，如AlpacaEval胜率提高8-10%，MT-Bench平均提升0.3分，IFEval原则遵循胜率提高19-23%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了自动化原则驱动后训练在持续自我改进中的潜力，同时保持了模型的性能与可解释性。

Abstract: When language model (LM) users aim to improve the quality of its generations,
it is crucial to specify concrete behavioral attributes that the model should
strive to reflect. However, curating such principles across many domains, even
non-exhaustively, requires a labor-intensive annotation process. To automate
this process, we propose eliciting these latent attributes guiding model
reasoning towards human-preferred responses by explicitly modeling them in a
self-correction setting. Our approach mines new principles from the LM itself
and compresses the discovered elements to an interpretable set via clustering.
Specifically, we employ an approximation of posterior-regularized Monte Carlo
Expectation-Maximization to both identify a condensed set of the most effective
latent principles and teach the LM to strategically invoke them in order to
intrinsically refine its responses. We demonstrate that bootstrapping our
algorithm over multiple iterations enables smaller language models (7-8B
parameters) to self-improve, achieving +8-10% in AlpacaEval win-rate, an
average of +0.3 on MT-Bench, and +19-23% in principle-following win-rate on
IFEval. We also show that clustering the principles yields interpretable and
diverse model-generated constitutions while retaining model performance. The
gains our method achieves highlight the potential of automated,
principle-driven post-training recipes toward continual self-improvement.

Result: 贡献了QATD-2k，最大的开源真实世界辅导数据集。

Conclusion: PIIvot框架有效简化PII匿名化，QATD-2k数据集填补了教育对话数据的空白。

Abstract: Personally identifiable information (PII) anonymization is a high-stakes task
that poses a barrier to many open-science data sharing initiatives. While PII
identification has made large strides in recent years, in practice, error
thresholds and the recall/precision trade-off still limit the uptake of these
anonymization pipelines. We present PIIvot, a lighter-weight framework for PII
anonymization that leverages knowledge of the data context to simplify the PII
detection problem. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we also contribute
QATD-2k, the largest open-source real-world tutoring dataset of its kind, to
support the demand for quality educational dialogue data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）在敏感应用中的广泛使用，需要有效的水印技术以确保AI生成文本的来源和可追溯性。现有方法大多需要访问解码过程，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出ICW技术，通过提示工程在生成文本中嵌入水印，利用LLMs的上下文学习和指令遵循能力。研究了四种不同粒度的ICW策略及其检测方法，并以间接提示注入（IPI）为例进行案例分析。

Result: 实验验证了ICW作为一种模型无关、实用的水印方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 随着LLMs能力的提升，ICW为可扩展和易用的内容溯源提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for sensitive applications
has highlighted the need for effective watermarking techniques to ensure the
provenance and accountability of AI-generated text. However, most existing
watermarking methods require access to the decoding process, limiting their
applicability in real-world settings. One illustrative example is the use of
LLMs by dishonest reviewers in the context of academic peer review, where
conference organizers have no access to the model used but still need to detect
AI-generated reviews. Motivated by this gap, we introduce In-Context
Watermarking (ICW), which embeds watermarks into generated text solely through
prompt engineering, leveraging LLMs' in-context learning and
instruction-following abilities. We investigate four ICW strategies at
different levels of granularity, each paired with a tailored detection method.
We further examine the Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) setting as a specific
case study, in which watermarking is covertly triggered by modifying input
documents such as academic manuscripts. Our experiments validate the
feasibility of ICW as a model-agnostic, practical watermarking approach.
Moreover, our findings suggest that as LLMs become more capable, ICW offers a
promising direction for scalable and accessible content attribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对低资源语言的多语言模型压缩需求，结合现有技术并推向极致，以减少模型大小同时保留关键语言知识。

Method: 采用两步知识蒸馏、结构化剪枝、截断和词汇修剪，减少层深度、前馈隐藏层大小和中间层嵌入尺寸。

Result: 压缩率高达92%，下游任务性能仅下降2-10%，性能损失与教师模型中语言特定数据量相关。

Conclusion: 该方法在低资源语言中高效压缩模型，性能损失可控，为多语言模型压缩提供了实践指导。

Abstract: In this paper, we combine two-step knowledge distillation, structured
pruning, truncation, and vocabulary trimming for extremely compressing
multilingual encoder-only language models for low-resource languages. Our novel
approach systematically combines existing techniques and takes them to the
extreme, reducing layer depth, feed-forward hidden size, and intermediate layer
embedding size to create significantly smaller monolingual models while
retaining essential language-specific knowledge. We achieve compression rates
of up to 92% with only a marginal performance drop of 2-10% in four downstream
tasks, including sentiment analysis, topic classification, named entity
recognition, and part-of-speech tagging, across three low-resource languages.
Notably, the performance degradation correlates with the amount of
language-specific data in the teacher model, with larger datasets resulting in
smaller performance losses. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
to identify best practices for multilingual model compression using these
techniques.

Abstract: Text segmentation based on the semantic meaning of sentences is a fundamental
task with broad utility in many downstream applications. In this paper, we
propose a graphical model-based unsupervised learning approach, named BP-Seg
for efficient text segmentation. Our method not only considers local coherence,
capturing the intuition that adjacent sentences are often more related, but
also effectively groups sentences that are distant in the text yet semantically
similar. This is achieved through belief propagation on the carefully
constructed graphical models. Experimental results on both an illustrative
example and a dataset with long-form documents demonstrate that our method
performs favorably compared to competing approaches.

Method: 使用现成的TTS模型将文本语料库转换为合成语音，开发基于可懂度的评估框架，并确定合成数据对ASR训练的有效阈值。

Result: 生成了超过50万小时的十种语言合成语音，预训练Whisper-large-v3模型，平均转录错误降低30%以上。

Conclusion: Speech Back-Translation具有可扩展性和高效性，能显著提升多语言ASR系统的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have been largely
fueled by massive speech corpora. However, extending coverage to diverse
languages with limited resources remains a formidable challenge. This paper
introduces Speech Back-Translation, a scalable pipeline that improves
multilingual ASR models by converting large-scale text corpora into synthetic
speech via off-the-shelf text-to-speech (TTS) models. We demonstrate that just
tens of hours of real transcribed speech can effectively train TTS models to
generate synthetic speech at hundreds of times the original volume while
maintaining high quality. To evaluate synthetic speech quality, we develop an
intelligibility-based assessment framework and establish clear thresholds for
when synthetic data benefits ASR training. Using Speech Back-Translation, we
generate more than 500,000 hours of synthetic speech in ten languages and
continue pre-training Whisper-large-v3, achieving average transcription error
reductions of over 30\%. These results highlight the scalability and
effectiveness of Speech Back-Translation for enhancing multilingual ASR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长文本事实性评估方法（如FactScore和VeriScore）虽然有效，但计算成本高，限制了其在大规模评估和训练中的应用。

Method: 利用合成数据微调Llama3.1 8B模型，同时提取和验证文本中的所有可验证声明，基于Google搜索的证据。

Result: VeriFastScore在速度和相关性上表现优异，与VeriScore的相关系数分别为0.80（示例级别）和0.94（系统级别），速度提升6.6倍。

Conclusion: VeriFastScore为长文本事实性评估提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，并公开了模型和数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Metrics like FactScore and VeriScore that evaluate long-form factuality
operate by decomposing an input response into atomic claims and then
individually verifying each claim. While effective and interpretable, these
methods incur numerous LLM calls and can take upwards of 100 seconds to
evaluate a single response, limiting their practicality in large-scale
evaluation and training scenarios. To address this, we propose VeriFastScore,
which leverages synthetic data to fine-tune Llama3.1 8B for simultaneously
extracting and verifying all verifiable claims within a given text based on
evidence from Google Search. We show that this task cannot be solved via
few-shot prompting with closed LLMs due to its complexity: the model receives
~4K tokens of evidence on average and needs to concurrently decompose claims,
judge their verifiability, and verify them against noisy evidence. However, our
fine-tuned VeriFastScore model demonstrates strong correlation with the
original VeriScore pipeline at both the example level (r=0.80) and system level
(r=0.94) while achieving an overall speedup of 6.6x (9.9x excluding evidence
retrieval) over VeriScore. To facilitate future factuality research, we
publicly release our VeriFastScore model and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: 组位置编码范式有效解决了流式处理中的不匹配问题，提升了LLMs在流式和批处理模式下的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily designed for batch processing.
Existing methods for adapting LLMs to streaming rely either on expensive
re-encoding or specialized architectures with limited scalability. This work
identifies three key mismatches in adapting batch-oriented LLMs to streaming:
(1) input-attention, (2) output-attention, and (3) position-ID mismatches.
While it is commonly assumed that the latter two mismatches require frequent
re-encoding, our analysis reveals that only the input-attention mismatch
significantly impacts performance, indicating re-encoding outputs is largely
unnecessary. To better understand this discrepancy with the common assumption,
we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of position encoding
on LLMs in streaming, showing that preserving relative positions within source
and target contexts is more critical than maintaining absolute order. Motivated
by the above analysis, we introduce a group position encoding paradigm built on
batch architectures to enhance consistency between streaming and batch modes.
Extensive experiments on cross-lingual and cross-modal tasks demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing approaches. Our method requires no
architectural modifications, exhibits strong generalization in both streaming
and batch modes. The code is available at repository

Conclusion: T1为工具使用和规划研究提供了基准，并验证了语言模型的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
intelligent agents capable of solving complex problems. However, effective
planning in scenarios involving dependencies between API or tool
calls-particularly in multi-turn conversations-remains a significant challenge.
To address this, we introduce T1, a tool-augmented, multi-domain, multi-turn
conversational dataset specifically designed to capture and manage inter-tool
dependencies across diverse domains. T1 enables rigorous evaluation of agents'
ability to coordinate tool use across nine distinct domains (4 single domain
and 5 multi-domain) with the help of an integrated caching mechanism for both
short- and long-term memory, while supporting dynamic replanning-such as
deciding whether to recompute or reuse cached results. Beyond facilitating
research on tool use and planning, T1 also serves as a benchmark for evaluating
the performance of open-source language models. We present results powered by
T1-Agent, highlighting their ability to plan and reason in complex,
tool-dependent scenarios.

validated by comparing step-by-step outputs with its official implementation.
(2) MASLab provides a unified environment with various benchmarks for fair
comparisons among methods, ensuring consistent inputs and standardized

MASLab, we conduct extensive experiments covering 10+ benchmarks and 8 models,
offering researchers a clear and comprehensive view of the current landscape of
MAS methods. MASLab will continue to evolve, tracking the latest developments
in the field, and invite contributions from the broader open-source community.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种解耦的情感支持对话框架（Decoupled ESC），通过Inferential Preference Mining（IPM）构建高质量偏好数据，并基于Gross的情绪调节扩展过程模型，将任务分解为策略规划和共情回复生成两个子任务，显著提升了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感支持对话（ESC）任务中，直接偏好优化（DPO）因数据结构和优化模糊性问题效果受限，需解决心理策略与回复内容的纠缠问题。

Method: 提出IPM方法构建IPM-PrefDial数据集，并设计解耦框架，将任务分为策略规划和共情回复生成，分别通过SFT和DPO优化。

Result: 实验表明，解耦框架优于联合优化基线，减少了偏好偏差并提升了回复质量。

Conclusion: 解耦框架和IPM方法有效解决了ESC任务中的关键挑战，为情感支持生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) have improved
emotional support generation by fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) via
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, common psychological errors still
persist. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) shows promise in reducing
such errors through pairwise preference learning, its effectiveness in ESC
tasks is limited by two key challenges: (1) Entangled data structure: Existing
ESC data inherently entangles psychological strategies and response content,
making it difficult to construct high-quality preference pairs; and (2)
Optimization ambiguity: Applying vanilla DPO to such entangled pairwise data
leads to ambiguous training objectives. To address these issues, we introduce
Inferential Preference Mining (IPM) to construct high-quality preference data,
forming the IPM-PrefDial dataset. Building upon this data, we propose a
Decoupled ESC framework inspired by Gross's Extended Process Model of Emotion
Regulation, which decomposes the ESC task into two sequential subtasks:
strategy planning and empathic response generation. Each was trained via SFT
and subsequently enhanced by DPO to align with the psychological preference.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Decoupled ESC framework outperforms
joint optimization baselines, reducing preference bias and improving response
quality.

Conclusion: 形式语言对LLMs推理能力有显著影响，拒绝微调方法可有效提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to achieve breakthrough
performance on complex logical reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, most existing
research focuses on employing formal language to guide LLMs to derive reliable
reasoning paths, while systematic evaluations of these capabilities are still
limited. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs
across various logical reasoning problems utilizing formal languages. From the
perspective of three dimensions, i.e., spectrum of LLMs, taxonomy of tasks, and
format of trajectories, our key findings are: 1) Thinking models significantly
outperform Instruct models, especially when formal language is employed; 2) All
LLMs exhibit limitations in inductive reasoning capability, irrespective of
whether they use a formal language; 3) Data with PoT format achieves the best
generalization performance across other languages. Additionally, we also curate
the formal-relative training data to further enhance the small language models,
and the experimental results indicate that a simple rejected fine-tuning method
can better enable LLMs to generalize across formal languages and achieve the
best overall performance. Our codes and reports are available at

Result: 实验表明R1-Searcher++优于现有RAG和推理方法，实现高效检索。

Conclusion: R1-Searcher++通过结合内外知识，持续提升模型能力，为检索增强推理提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but prone to hallucinations due to
static knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps by injecting
external information, but current methods often are costly, generalize poorly,
or ignore the internal knowledge of the model. In this paper, we introduce
R1-Searcher++, a novel framework designed to train LLMs to adaptively leverage
both internal and external knowledge sources. R1-Searcher++ employs a two-stage
training strategy: an initial SFT Cold-start phase for preliminary format
learning, followed by RL for Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition. The RL stage uses
outcome-supervision to encourage exploration, incorporates a reward mechanism
for internal knowledge utilization, and integrates a memorization mechanism to
continuously assimilate retrieved information, thereby enriching the model's
internal knowledge. By leveraging internal knowledge and external search
engine, the model continuously improves its capabilities, enabling efficient
retrieval-augmented reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that R1-Searcher++
outperforms previous RAG and reasoning methods and achieves efficient
retrieval. The code is available at

Result: 在VIPeR、GRID和PRID450S数据集上实验表明，该方法优于现有先进技术。

Conclusion: HDFF结合TXQDA有效提升了行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Video surveillance image analysis and processing is a challenging field in
computer vision, with one of its most difficult tasks being Person
Re-Identification (PRe-ID). PRe-ID aims to identify and track target
individuals who have already been detected in a network of cameras, using a
robust description of their pedestrian images. The success of recent research
in person PRe-ID is largely due to effective feature extraction and
representation, as well as the powerful learning of these features to reliably
discriminate between pedestrian images. To this end, two powerful features,
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO), are
modeled on multidimensional data using the proposed method, High-Dimensional
Feature Fusion (HDFF). Specifically, a new tensor fusion scheme is introduced
to leverage and combine these two types of features in a single tensor, even
though their dimensions are not identical. To enhance the system's accuracy, we
employ Tensor Cross-View Quadratic Analysis (TXQDA) for multilinear subspace
learning, followed by cosine similarity for matching. TXQDA efficiently
facilitates learning while reducing the high dimensionality inherent in
high-order tensor data. The effectiveness of our approach is verified through
experiments on three widely-used PRe-ID datasets: VIPeR, GRID, and PRID450S.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods.

capabilities and limitations for AD-specific applications. Additionally, we
discuss hybrid methods integrating conventional techniques with generative
approaches, and emphasize their improved adaptability and robustness. We also

developments in GenAI. Finally, we discuss three core challenges: safety,
interpretability, and realtime capabilities, and present recommendations for
image generation, dynamic scenario generation, and planning.

Motivation: 尽管LVLMs取得了显著进展，但其在图像中定位和解释文本信息的可解释性仍存在不足。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析多种LVLMs，识别出OCR Head，并研究其特性（稀疏性、性质、激活频率），并通过下游任务（如Chain-of-Thought和头部掩码）验证发现。

Result: OCR Head具有低稀疏性、性质独特且静态激活的特点，重新分配其sink-token值可提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LVLMs处理图像中嵌入文本的内部机制，为模型可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), a
gap remains, particularly regarding their interpretability and how they locate
and interpret textual information within images. In this paper, we explore
various LVLMs to identify the specific heads responsible for recognizing text
from images, which we term the Optical Character Recognition Head (OCR Head).
Our findings regarding these heads are as follows: (1) Less Sparse: Unlike
previous retrieval heads, a large number of heads are activated to extract
textual information from images. (2) Qualitatively Distinct: OCR heads possess
properties that differ significantly from general retrieval heads, exhibiting
low similarity in their characteristics. (3) Statically Activated: The
frequency of activation for these heads closely aligns with their OCR scores.
We validate our findings in downstream tasks by applying Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
to both OCR and conventional retrieval heads and by masking these heads. We
also demonstrate that redistributing sink-token values within the OCR heads
improves performance. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the
internal mechanisms LVLMs employ in processing embedded textual information in
images.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于场景图的无监督检索框架SCENIR，通过图自编码器消除对标注数据的依赖，并在性能和效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于卷积和Transformer的图像检索模型易受低层次视觉特征（如颜色）的偏见影响，且缺乏语义理解。此外，监督式图神经网络依赖标注数据，但基于文本编码的不一致性影响了检索可靠性。

Method: 提出SCENIR，一种基于图自编码器的无监督检索框架，不依赖标注数据，并使用图编辑距离（GED）作为场景图相似性的确定性度量。

Result: SCENIR在性能和运行时效率上优于现有视觉、多模态和监督式GNN方法，并在未标注数据集上验证了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: SCENIR通过无监督学习和GED度量，显著提升了图像检索的语义理解能力，并推动了反事实图像检索的进展。

Abstract: Despite the dominance of convolutional and transformer-based architectures in
image-to-image retrieval, these models are prone to biases arising from
low-level visual features, such as color. Recognizing the lack of semantic
understanding as a key limitation, we propose a novel scene graph-based
retrieval framework that emphasizes semantic content over superficial image
characteristics. Prior approaches to scene graph retrieval predominantly rely
on supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which require ground truth graph
pairs driven from image captions. However, the inconsistency of caption-based
supervision stemming from variable text encodings undermine retrieval
reliability. To address these, we present SCENIR, a Graph Autoencoder-based
unsupervised retrieval framework, which eliminates the dependence on labeled
training data. Our model demonstrates superior performance across metrics and
runtime efficiency, outperforming existing vision-based, multimodal, and
supervised GNN approaches. We further advocate for Graph Edit Distance (GED) as
a deterministic and robust ground truth measure for scene graph similarity,
replacing the inconsistent caption-based alternatives for the first time in
image-to-image retrieval evaluation. Finally, we validate the generalizability
of our method by applying it to unannotated datasets via automated scene graph
generation, while substantially contributing in advancing state-of-the-art in
counterfactual image retrieval.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统获取通勤OD流数据的方法成本高且涉及隐私问题，卫星图像提供了一种公开且富含语义信息的替代方案。

Method: GlODGen结合视觉语言地理基础模型提取卫星图像中的语义特征，并与人口数据结合，通过图扩散模型生成OD流。

Result: 在四大洲六个城市的实验中，GlODGen生成的OD流数据与真实数据高度一致，表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GlODGen为全球城市提供了一种高效、自动化的OD流数据生成工具，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Commuting Origin-destination~(OD) flows, capturing daily population mobility
of citizens, are vital for sustainable development across cities around the
world. However, it is challenging to obtain the data due to the high cost of
travel surveys and privacy concerns. Surprisingly, we find that satellite
imagery, publicly available across the globe, contains rich urban semantic
signals to support high-quality OD flow generation, with over 98\%
expressiveness of traditional multisource hard-to-collect urban
sociodemographic, economics, land use, and point of interest data. This
inspires us to design a novel data generator, GlODGen, which can generate OD
flow data for any cities of interest around the world. Specifically, GlODGen
first leverages Vision-Language Geo-Foundation Models to extract urban semantic
signals related to human mobility from satellite imagery. These features are
then combined with population data to form region-level representations, which
are used to generate OD flows via graph diffusion models. Extensive experiments
on 4 continents and 6 representative cities show that GlODGen has great
generalizability across diverse urban environments on different continents and
can generate OD flow data for global cities highly consistent with real-world
mobility data. We implement GlODGen as an automated tool, seamlessly
integrating data acquisition and curation, urban semantic feature extraction,
and OD flow generation together. It has been released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型合并研究主要针对全微调模型，忽视了流行的LoRA模块。研究发现，现有合并方法在LoRA上表现不佳，且LoRA模块参数幅度差异较大，导致合并性能下降。

Method: 提出DO-Merging方法，将参数解耦为幅度和方向两部分并独立合并；引入无数据的层梯度下降方法，结合正交约束以减少方向合并时的干扰。

Result: 实验证明DO-Merging在视觉、语言和多模态任务中显著优于现有合并方法，且各组件可灵活集成，带来近乎免费的改进。

Conclusion: DO-Merging通过解耦和正交合并有效解决了LoRA合并问题，为模型合并提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: With more open-source models available for diverse tasks, model merging has
gained attention by combining models into one, reducing training, storage, and
inference costs. Current research mainly focuses on model merging for full
fine-tuning, overlooking the popular LoRA. However, our empirical analysis
reveals that: a) existing merging methods designed for full fine-tuning perform
poorly on LoRA; b) LoRA modules show much larger parameter magnitude variance
than full fine-tuned weights; c) greater parameter magnitude variance
correlates with worse merging performance. Considering that large magnitude
variances cause deviations in the distribution of the merged parameters,
resulting in information loss and performance degradation, we propose a
Decoupled and Orthogonal merging approach(DO-Merging). By separating parameters
into magnitude and direction components and merging them independently, we
reduce the impact of magnitude differences on the directional alignment of the
merged models, thereby preserving task information. Furthermore, we introduce a
data-free, layer-wise gradient descent method with orthogonal constraints to
mitigate interference during the merging of direction components. We provide
theoretical guarantees for both the decoupling and orthogonal components. And
we validate through extensive experiments across vision, language, and
multi-modal domains that our proposed DO-Merging can achieve significantly
higher performance than existing merging methods at a minimal cost. Notably,
each component can be flexibly integrated with existing methods, offering near
free-lunch improvements across tasks.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像检索器在处理属性聚焦查询时表现不佳，尤其是CLIP类检索器，因其图像嵌入侧重全局语义而忽略细节。

Method: 提出使用基于提示的图像嵌入方法，通过多模态检索器生成可提示的图像嵌入，并优化预处理和线性近似策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升性能，预处理策略在预定义提示下Recall@5提升15%，线性近似策略在推理时提示可用时提升8%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通用图像嵌入不适合属性聚焦查询，而基于提示的图像嵌入方法能有效解决这一问题，并具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide
crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of
this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual
attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling
attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with
9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like
retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot
ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image
embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other
details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model
(MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with
this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image
embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose
to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers,
which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for
deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base
retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two
acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear
approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5
when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when
prompts are only available during inference.

Result: GRIT在仅需20个图像-问题-答案三元组的情况下，高效训练模型生成连贯且视觉基础的推理链。

Conclusion: GRIT成功统一了推理和基础能力，展示了多模态语言模型在视觉推理任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using Reinforcement Learning
(RL) in building reasoning models that articulate chains of thoughts prior to
producing final answers. However, despite ongoing advances that aim at enabling
reasoning for vision-language tasks, existing open-source visual reasoning
models typically generate reasoning content with pure natural language, lacking
explicit integration of visual information. This limits their ability to
produce clearly articulated and visually grounded reasoning chains. To this
end, we propose Grounded Reasoning with Images and Texts (GRIT), a novel method
for training MLLMs to think with images. GRIT introduces a grounded reasoning
paradigm, in which models generate reasoning chains that interleave natural
language and explicit bounding box coordinates. These coordinates point to
regions of the input image that the model consults during its reasoning
process. Additionally, GRIT is equipped with a reinforcement learning approach,
GRPO-GR, built upon the GRPO algorithm. GRPO-GR employs robust rewards focused
on the final answer accuracy and format of the grounded reasoning output, which
eliminates the need for data with reasoning chain annotations or explicit
bounding box labels. As a result, GRIT achieves exceptional data efficiency,
requiring as few as 20 image-question-answer triplets from existing datasets.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that GRIT effectively trains MLLMs to
produce coherent and visually grounded reasoning chains, showing a successful
unification of reasoning and grounding abilities.

Motivation: 当前方法多关注普通驾驶场景，缺乏逼真的对抗性场景生成能力。

Method: 采用物理感知的多轮轨迹优化和定制评分函数。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上生成多样化对抗场景，显著提高碰撞率。

Conclusion: Challenger能有效测试自动驾驶模型，且对抗行为可迁移。

Abstract: Generating photorealistic driving videos has seen significant progress
recently, but current methods largely focus on ordinary, non-adversarial
scenarios. Meanwhile, efforts to generate adversarial driving scenarios often
operate on abstract trajectory or BEV representations, falling short of
delivering realistic sensor data that can truly stress-test autonomous driving
(AD) systems. In this work, we introduce Challenger, a framework that produces
physically plausible yet photorealistic adversarial driving videos. Generating
such videos poses a fundamental challenge: it requires jointly optimizing over
the space of traffic interactions and high-fidelity sensor observations.
Challenger makes this affordable through two techniques: (1) a physics-aware
multi-round trajectory refinement process that narrows down candidate
adversarial maneuvers, and (2) a tailored trajectory scoring function that
encourages realistic yet adversarial behavior while maintaining compatibility
with downstream video synthesis. As tested on the nuScenes dataset, Challenger
generates a diverse range of aggressive driving scenarios-including cut-ins,
sudden lane changes, tailgating, and blind spot intrusions-and renders them
into multiview photorealistic videos. Extensive evaluations show that these
scenarios significantly increase the collision rate of state-of-the-art
end-to-end AD models (UniAD, VAD, SparseDrive, and DiffusionDrive), and
importantly, adversarial behaviors discovered for one model often transfer to
others.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Video Question Answering (VideoQA) have introduced
LLM-based agents, modular frameworks, and procedural solutions, yielding
promising results. These systems use dynamic agents and memory-based mechanisms
to break down complex tasks and refine answers. However, significant
improvements remain in tracking objects for grounding over time and
decision-making based on reasoning to better align object references with
language model outputs, as newer models get better at both tasks. This work
presents an LLM-brained agent for zero-shot Video Question Answering (VideoQA)
that combines a Chain-of-Thought framework with grounding reasoning alongside
YOLO-World to enhance object tracking and alignment. This approach establishes
a new state-of-the-art in VideoQA and Video Understanding, showing enhanced
performance on NExT-QA, iVQA, and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. Our framework also
enables cross-checking of grounding timeframes, improving accuracy and
providing valuable support for verification and increased output reliability
across multiple video domains. The code is available at

Abstract: With video games now generating the highest revenues in the entertainment
industry, optimizing game development workflows has become essential for the
sector's sustained growth. Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
offer considerable potential to automate and enhance various aspects of game
development, particularly Quality Assurance (QA), which remains one of the
industry's most labor-intensive processes with limited automation options. To
accurately evaluate the performance of VLMs in video game QA tasks and
determine their effectiveness in handling real-world scenarios, there is a
clear need for standardized benchmarks, as existing benchmarks are insufficient
to address the specific requirements of this domain. To bridge this gap, we
introduce VideoGameQA-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers a wide array
of game QA activities, including visual unit testing, visual regression
testing, needle-in-a-haystack tasks, glitch detection, and bug report
generation for both images and videos of various games. Code and data are

Result: 实验证明，稀疏信号可通过凸优化实现完美重建，且运动模糊有助于超分辨率。

Conclusion: 通过优化方法和运动模糊的合理利用，可实现大幅分辨率提升，为超分辨率技术提供新思路。

Abstract: We consider the limits of super-resolution using imaging constraints. Due to
various theoretical and practical limitations, reconstruction-based methods
have been largely restricted to small increases in resolution. In addition,
motion-blur is usually seen as a nuisance that impedes super-resolution. We
show that by using high-precision motion information, sparse image priors, and
convex optimization, it is possible to increase resolution by large factors. A
key operation in super-resolution is deconvolution with a box. In general,
convolution with a box is not invertible. However, we obtain perfect
reconstructions of sparse signals using convex optimization. We also show that
motion blur can be helpful for super-resolution. We demonstrate that using
pseudo-random motion it is possible to reconstruct a high-resolution target
using a single low-resolution image. We present numerical experiments with
simulated data and results with real data captured by a camera mounted on a
computer controlled stage.

TLDR: OViP框架通过动态构建对比训练数据，减少大视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，同时保持多模态能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）容易产生与视觉输入不符的幻觉内容，现有方法依赖预定义或随机编辑的负样本，效果有限。

Method: 提出在线视觉语言偏好学习（OViP）框架，动态生成基于模型自身幻觉输出的对比训练数据，并使用扩散模型合成负样本。

Result: 实验表明，OViP有效减少幻觉，同时保持多模态能力。

Conclusion: OViP通过实时生成相关监督信号，显著提升模型对齐能力，并优化了幻觉抑制与表达力的平衡。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to hallucination,
often generating content misaligned with visual inputs. While recent approaches
advance multi-modal Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate
hallucination, they typically rely on predefined or randomly edited negative
samples that fail to reflect actual model errors, limiting training efficacy.
In this work, we propose an Online Vision-language Preference Learning (OViP)
framework that dynamically constructs contrastive training data based on the
model's own hallucinated outputs. By identifying semantic differences between
sampled response pairs and synthesizing negative images using a diffusion
model, OViP generates more relevant supervision signals in real time. This
failure-driven training enables adaptive alignment of both textual and visual
preferences. Moreover, we refine existing evaluation protocols to better
capture the trade-off between hallucination suppression and expressiveness.
Experiments on hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate that OViP
effectively reduces hallucinations while preserving core multi-modal
capabilities.

Motivation: 传统的链式思维推理仅限于文本空间，限制了在视觉密集型任务中的效果。为了解决这一问题，作者探索了在像素空间进行推理的可能性。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方法：1) 指令调优以熟悉视觉操作；2) 强化学习阶段通过好奇心驱动奖励平衡像素空间与文本推理。

Conclusion: 像素空间推理对提升VLMs性能至关重要，所提出的框架在视觉任务中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning has significantly improved the performance of
Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. However, this reasoning
process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its
effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we
introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel
framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual
reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable
VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby
enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space
reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the
model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly
introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a
two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on
synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual
operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a
curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space
reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can
interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos
to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning
benchmarks. Our 7B model, \model, achieves 84\% on V* bench, 74\% on
TallyQA-Complex, and 84\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy
achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the
importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework.

Motivation: 探索视觉模型是否能够学习并编码ImageNet层次结构，以理解其内部表示是否与分类学结构一致。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）作为解释工具，分析视觉模型的内部表示，并研究DINOv2模型中不同层的激活模式。

Result: SAEs揭示了模型激活中的层次关系，表明视觉模型隐式编码了分类学结构，且信息在DINOv2的每一层中逐渐增加。

Conclusion: 研究为系统分析视觉模型的层次表示提供了框架，并展示了SAEs在探测深度网络语义结构中的潜力。

Abstract: The ImageNet hierarchy provides a structured taxonomy of object categories,
offering a valuable lens through which to analyze the representations learned
by deep vision models. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how
vision models encode the ImageNet hierarchy, leveraging Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to probe their internal representations. SAEs have been widely used as
an explanation tool for large language models (LLMs), where they enable the
discovery of semantically meaningful features. Here, we extend their use to
vision models to investigate whether learned representations align with the
ontological structure defined by the ImageNet taxonomy. Our results show that
SAEs uncover hierarchical relationships in model activations, revealing an
implicit encoding of taxonomic structure. We analyze the consistency of these
representations across different layers of the popular vision foundation model
DINOv2 and provide insights into how deep vision models internalize
hierarchical category information by increasing information in the class token
through each layer. Our study establishes a framework for systematic
hierarchical analysis of vision model representations and highlights the
potential of SAEs as a tool for probing semantic structure in deep networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像等关键领域，深度学习模型的可靠性至关重要。传统方法在域偏移场景下表现不佳，因此需要一种能够增强模型鲁棒性和适应性的方法。

Conclusion: CE-ViTs通过集成学习和域适应技术，显著提升了共形预测的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Exploring the trustworthiness of deep learning models is crucial, especially
in critical domains such as medical imaging decision support systems. Conformal
prediction has emerged as a rigorous means of providing deep learning models
with reliable uncertainty estimates and safety guarantees. However, conformal
prediction results face challenges due to the backbone model's struggles in
domain-shifted scenarios, such as variations in different sources. To aim this
challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework termed Conformal Ensemble of
Vision Transformers (CE-ViTs) designed to enhance image classification
performance by prioritizing domain adaptation and model robustness, while
accounting for uncertainty. The proposed method leverages an ensemble of vision
transformer models in the backbone, trained on diverse datasets including
HAM10000, Dermofit, and Skin Cancer ISIC datasets. This ensemble learning
approach, calibrated through the combined mentioned datasets, aims to enhance
domain adaptation through conformal learning. Experimental results underscore
that the framework achieves a high coverage rate of 90.38\%, representing an
improvement of 9.95\% compared to the HAM10000 model. This indicates a strong
likelihood that the prediction set includes the true label compared to singular
models. Ensemble learning in CE-ViTs significantly improves conformal
prediction performance, increasing the average prediction set size for
challenging misclassified samples from 1.86 to 3.075.

Result: 在face2comics和edges2shoes数据集上实现了高质量、语义一致的图像翻译。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像翻译任务提供了一种有潜力的替代方案，优于传统的GAN模型。

Abstract: Image-to-image translation aims to learn a mapping between a source and a
target domain, enabling tasks such as style transfer, appearance
transformation, and domain adaptation. In this work, we explore a
diffusion-based framework for image-to-image translation by adapting Diffusion
Transformers (DiT), which combine the denoising capabilities of diffusion
models with the global modeling power of transformers. To guide the translation
process, we condition the model on image embeddings extracted from a
pre-trained CLIP encoder, allowing for fine-grained and structurally consistent
translations without relying on text or class labels. We incorporate both a
CLIP similarity loss to enforce semantic consistency and an LPIPS perceptual
loss to enhance visual fidelity during training. We validate our approach on
two benchmark datasets: face2comics, which translates real human faces to
comic-style illustrations, and edges2shoes, which translates edge maps to
realistic shoe images. Experimental results demonstrate that DiT, combined with
CLIP-based conditioning and perceptual similarity objectives, achieves
high-quality, semantically faithful translations, offering a promising
alternative to GAN-based models for paired image-to-image translation tasks.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the image processing community should broaden
its focus from purely model-centric development to include agentic system
design as an essential complementary paradigm. While deep learning has
significantly advanced capabilities for specific image processing tasks,
current approaches face critical limitations in generalization, adaptability,
and real-world problem-solving flexibility. We propose that developing
intelligent agentic systems, capable of dynamically selecting, combining, and
optimizing existing image processing tools, represents the next evolutionary
step for the field. Such systems would emulate human experts' ability to
strategically orchestrate different tools to solve complex problems, overcoming
the brittleness of monolithic models. The paper analyzes key limitations of
model-centric paradigms, establishes design principles for agentic image
processing systems, and outlines different capability levels for such agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA模型缺乏对视频上下文的理解或对小失真的敏感性，LLM模型则难以同时处理质量评分和描述。CP-LLM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: CP-LLM采用双视觉编码器分别处理高、低层次信息，语言解码器分析其交互，通过多任务训练优化评分、描述生成和对比。

Result: CP-LLM在VQA基准测试中表现优异，对小失真（如压缩伪影）更敏感，实现了跨数据集的最优性能。

Conclusion: CP-LLM为视频质量评估提供了一种全面且实用的解决方案，适用于真实场景。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a challenging research topic with broad
applications. Effective VQA necessitates sensitivity to pixel-level distortions
and a comprehensive understanding of video context to accurately determine the
perceptual impact of distortions. Traditional hand-crafted and learning-based
VQA models mainly focus on pixel-level distortions and lack contextual
understanding, while recent LLM-based models struggle with sensitivity to small
distortions or handle quality scoring and description as separate tasks. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce CP-LLM: a Context and Pixel aware
Large Language Model. CP-LLM is a novel multimodal LLM architecture featuring
dual vision encoders designed to independently analyze perceptual quality at
both high-level (video context) and low-level (pixel distortion) granularity,
along with a language decoder subsequently reasons about the interplay between
these aspects. This design enables CP-LLM to simultaneously produce robust
quality scores and interpretable quality descriptions, with enhanced
sensitivity to pixel distortions (e.g. compression artifacts). The model is
trained via a multi-task pipeline optimizing for score prediction, description
generation, and pairwise comparisons. Experiment results demonstrate that
CP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset performance on established VQA
benchmarks and superior robustness to pixel distortions, confirming its
efficacy for comprehensive and practical video quality assessment in real-world
scenarios.

Abstract: Perceiving pedestrians in highly crowded urban environments is a difficult

ground truth generation for such challenging scenes is performance-critical yet
very challenging. The difficulties include the sparsity of the captured
pedestrian point cloud and a lack of suitable benchmarks for a specific system
design study. To tackle the challenges, we first collect a new multi-view
LiDAR-camera 3D multiple-object-tracking benchmark of highly crowded
pedestrians for in-depth analysis. We then build an offboard auto-labeling
system that reconstructs pedestrian trajectories from LiDAR point cloud and
multi-view images. To improve the generalization power for crowded scenes and
the performance for small objects, we propose to learn high-resolution
representations that are density-aware and relationship-aware. Extensive
experiments validate that our approach significantly improves the 3D pedestrian
tracking performance towards higher auto-labeling efficiency. The code will be

Abstract: Leaf diseases are harmful conditions that affect the health, appearance and
productivity of plants, leading to significant plant loss and negatively
impacting farmers' livelihoods. These diseases cause visible symptoms such as
lesions, color changes, and texture variations, making it difficult for farmers
to manage plant health, especially in large or remote farms where expert
knowledge is limited. The main motivation of this study is to provide an
efficient and accessible solution for identifying plant leaf diseases in
Bangladesh, where agriculture plays a critical role in food security. The
objective of our research is to classify 21 distinct leaf diseases across six
plants using deep learning models, improving disease detection accuracy while
reducing the need for expert involvement. Deep Learning (DL) techniques,
including CNN and Transfer Learning (TL) models like VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2,
InceptionV3, ResNet50V2 and Xception are used. VGG19 and Xception achieve the
highest accuracies, with 98.90% and 98.66% respectively. Additionally,
Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as GradCAM, GradCAM++, LayerCAM, ScoreCAM
and FasterScoreCAM are used to enhance transparency by highlighting the regions
of the models focused on during disease classification. This transparency
ensures that farmers can understand the model's predictions and take necessary
action. This approach not only improves disease management but also supports
farmers in making informed decisions, leading to better plant protection and
increased agricultural productivity.

Conclusion: GMatch-SIFT在物体姿态估计中表现出高效性和通用性，验证了GMatch作为通用特征匹配器的潜力。

Abstract: We present GMatch, a learning-free feature matcher designed for robust 6DoF
object pose estimation, addressing common local ambiguities in sparse feature
matching. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on descriptor similarity,
GMatch performs a guided, incremental search, enforcing SE(3)-invariant
geometric consistency throughout the matching process. It leverages a provably
complete set of geometric features that uniquely determine 3D keypoint
configurations, ensuring globally consistent correspondences without the need
for training or GPU support. When combined with classical descriptors such as
SIFT, GMatch-SIFT forms a general-purpose pose estimation pipeline that offers
strong interpretability and generalization across diverse objects and scenes.
Experiments on the HOPE dataset show that GMatch outperforms both traditional
and learning-based matchers, with GMatch-SIFT achieving or surpassing the
performance of instance-level pose networks. On the YCB-Video dataset,
GMatch-SIFT demonstrates high accuracy and low variance on texture-rich
objects. These results not only validate the effectiveness of GMatch-SIFT for
object pose estimation but also highlight the broader applicability of GMatch
as a general-purpose feature matcher. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: LVLM在多模态任务中表现优异，但存在幻觉问题，即生成与视觉输入不一致的文本。现有方法计算成本高，且可能抑制不足或过度干预。

Method: 利用SAE识别与幻觉或实际语义相关的方向，提出SSL方法，通过干预这些方向来减少幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，SSL在减少幻觉方面显著优于现有解码方法，且具有跨模型架构的迁移性和低时间开销。

Conclusion: SSL是一种高效、无需训练的方法，可有效减少LVLM的幻觉问题，同时保持语义完整性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on
multimodal tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning.
However, they still suffer from hallucinations, generating text inconsistent
with visual input, posing significant risks in real-world applications.
Existing approaches to address this issue focus on incorporating external
knowledge bases, alignment training, or decoding strategies, all of which
require substantial computational cost and time. Recent works try to explore
more efficient alternatives by adjusting LVLMs' internal representations.
Although promising, these methods may cause hallucinations to be insufficiently
suppressed or lead to excessive interventions that negatively affect normal
semantics. In this work, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify
semantic directions closely associated with either hallucinations or actuality,
realizing more precise and direct hallucination-related representations. Our
analysis demonstrates that interventions along the faithful direction we
identified can mitigate hallucinations, while those along the hallucinatory
direction can exacerbate them. Building on these insights, we propose Steering
LVLMs via SAE Latent Directions (SSL), a training-free method based on
SAE-derived latent directions to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SSL significantly outperforms existing decoding
approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining transferability
across different model architectures with negligible additional time overhead.

*Zirui Pang,Haosheng Tan,Yuhan Pu,Zhijie Deng,Zhouan Shen,Keyu Hu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: REVEAL框架通过结合视觉语言模型和标签清理方法，系统解决图像分类数据集中噪声标签和缺失标签问题，显著提升6个基准测试集的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分类数据集存在噪声标签和缺失标签问题，导致模型评估不准确。现有方法主要关注噪声标签，而缺失标签问题被忽视。

Method: REVEAL整合预训练视觉语言模型（如LLaVA、BLIP）与标签清理方法（如Cleanlab），通过置信度预测和共识过滤检测噪声标签和缺失标签。

Result: REVEAL显著提升了6个基准测试集的质量，并通过人类验证证明其标签准确性高度符合人类判断。

Conclusion: REVEAL为图像分类数据集提供了更准确的标签，支持更公平和有效的模型评估。

Abstract: Image classification benchmark datasets such as CIFAR, MNIST, and ImageNet
serve as critical tools for model evaluation. However, despite the cleaning
efforts, these datasets still suffer from pervasive noisy labels and often
contain missing labels due to the co-existing image pattern where multiple
classes appear in an image sample. This results in misleading model comparisons
and unfair evaluations. Existing label cleaning methods focus primarily on
noisy labels, but the issue of missing labels remains largely overlooked.
Motivated by these challenges, we present a comprehensive framework named
REVEAL, integrating state-of-the-art pre-trained vision-language models (e.g.,
LLaVA, BLIP, Janus, Qwen) with advanced machine/human label curation methods
(e.g., Docta, Cleanlab, MTurk), to systematically address both noisy labels and
missing label detection in widely-used image classification test sets. REVEAL
detects potential noisy labels and omissions, aggregates predictions from
various methods, and refines label accuracy through confidence-informed
predictions and consensus-based filtering. Additionally, we provide a thorough
analysis of state-of-the-art vision-language models and pre-trained image
classifiers, highlighting their strengths and limitations within the context of
dataset renovation by revealing 10 observations. Our method effectively reveals
missing labels from public datasets and provides soft-labeled results with
likelihoods. Through human verifications, REVEAL significantly improves the
quality of 6 benchmark test sets, highly aligning to human judgments and
enabling more accurate and meaningful comparisons in image classification.

*Hongchen Wei,Zhenzhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: FRANK Model是一种无需训练的MLLM，通过分层权重合并方法，将视觉预训练的MLLM与推理专用LLM结合，显著提升了多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态LLM（MLLM）的推理能力扩展面临高成本重训练和高质量数据集稀缺的问题，FRANK Model旨在无需梯度更新或额外监督的情况下解决这一问题。

Method: 通过观察MLLM解码器层中视觉与文本注意力的分布差异，提出分层权重合并方法，结合视觉预训练MLLM和推理专用LLM。采用泰勒导出的闭式融合机制，在深层解码器层中集成推理能力，同时保留浅层解码器层的视觉基础。

Result: 在MMMU基准测试中，FRANK-38B以69.2的准确率超越最强基线InternVL2.5-38B（+5.3），甚至优于专有模型GPT-4o。

Conclusion: FRANK Model通过分层融合方法有效提升了MLLM的推理能力，为多模态推理领域提供了高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o1) have
showcased impressive reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning.
However, extending these capabilities to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is hampered by
the prohibitive costs of retraining and the scarcity of high-quality,
verifiable multimodal reasoning datasets. This paper introduces FRANK Model, a
training-FRee ANd r1-liKe MLLM that imbues off-the-shelf MLLMs with reasoning
and reflection abilities, without any gradient updates or extra supervision.
Our key insight is to decouple perception and reasoning across MLLM decoder
layers. Specifically, we observe that compared to the deeper decoder layers,
the shallow decoder layers allocate more attention to visual tokens, while the
deeper decoder layers concentrate on textual semantics. This observation
motivates a hierarchical weight merging approach that combines a
visual-pretrained MLLM with a reasoning-specialized LLM. To this end, we
propose a layer-wise, Taylor-derived closed-form fusion mechanism that
integrates reasoning capacity into deep decoder layers while preserving visual
grounding in shallow decoder layers. Extensive experiments on challenging
multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
On the MMMU benchmark, our model FRANK-38B achieves an accuracy of 69.2,
outperforming the strongest baseline InternVL2.5-38B by +5.3, and even
surpasses the proprietary GPT-4o model. Our project homepage is at:

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了BadDepth，首个针对单目深度估计（MDE）模型的后门攻击方法，通过选择性操纵目标物体的深度并生成中毒数据集，验证了其在数字和物理世界中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击方法无法直接应用于MDE模型，因其标签形式为深度图，需填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出BadDepth方法，利用图像分割模型选择性操纵目标物体深度，并通过深度补全恢复周围区域，生成中毒数据集。引入数字到物理的增强以适应物理世界场景。

Result: 在多个模型上的实验验证了BadDepth在数字和物理世界中的有效性，且不受环境因素影响。

Conclusion: BadDepth填补了MDE模型后门攻击的研究空白，展示了其在现实场景中的潜在威胁。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models
have been widely applied in fields such as autonomous driving and robotics.
However, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains unexplored. To fill
the gap in this area, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of backdoor
attacks against MDE models. Typically, existing backdoor attack methods can not
be applied to MDE models. This is because the label used in MDE is in the form
of a depth map. To address this, we propose BadDepth, the first backdoor attack
targeting MDE models. BadDepth overcomes this limitation by selectively
manipulating the target object's depth using an image segmentation model and
restoring the surrounding areas via depth completion, thereby generating
poisoned datasets for object-level backdoor attacks. To improve robustness in
physical world scenarios, we further introduce digital-to-physical augmentation
to adapt to the domain gap between the physical world and the digital domain.
Extensive experiments on multiple models validate the effectiveness of BadDepth
in both the digital domain and the physical world, without being affected by
environmental factors.

### [156] [Breaking Complexity Barriers: High-Resolution Image Restoration with Rank Enhanced Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16157)
*Yuang Ai,Huaibo Huang,Tao Wu,Qihang Fan,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为RELA的线性注意力增强方法，并基于此构建了高效的图像修复Transformer模型LAformer，解决了传统Transformer在高分辨率图像处理中的计算复杂性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在图像修复任务中表现优异，但其自注意力的二次复杂度限制了其在高分辨率图像上的应用。现有方法通过稀疏或窗口注意力缓解问题，但牺牲了全局上下文建模能力。

Method: 提出Rank Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA)，通过轻量级深度卷积增强特征表示；基于RELA构建LAformer模型，结合线性注意力和通道注意力实现全局感知，并通过卷积门控前馈网络增强局部拟合能力。

Result: LAformer在7个图像修复任务和21个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，同时显著提升了计算效率。

Conclusion: LAformer通过消除硬件低效操作（如softmax和窗口移位），实现了对高分辨率图像的高效处理，为图像修复任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made remarkable progress in image restoration
(IR) tasks. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformer
hinders its applicability to high-resolution images. Existing methods mitigate
this issue with sparse or window-based attention, yet inherently limit global
context modeling. Linear attention, a variant of softmax attention,
demonstrates promise in global context modeling while maintaining linear
complexity, offering a potential solution to the above challenge. Despite its
efficiency benefits, vanilla linear attention suffers from a significant
performance drop in IR, largely due to the low-rank nature of its attention
map. To counter this, we propose Rank Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA), a
simple yet effective method that enriches feature representations by
integrating a lightweight depthwise convolution. Building upon RELA, we propose
an efficient and effective image restoration Transformer, named LAformer.
LAformer achieves effective global perception by integrating linear attention
and channel attention, while also enhancing local fitting capabilities through
a convolutional gated feed-forward network. Notably, LAformer eliminates
hardware-inefficient operations such as softmax and window shifting, enabling
efficient processing of high-resolution images. Extensive experiments across 7
IR tasks and 21 benchmarks demonstrate that LAformer outperforms SOTA methods
and offers significant computational advantages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超高清图像质量退化问题，总结深度学习在该领域的创新，为研究者提供资源。

Method: 总结退化模型，整理现有数据集，按退化类型分类文献，回顾技术发展并提出分类框架。

Result: 系统梳理了UHD图像恢复的现状，提出了分类框架，并指出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文为UHD图像恢复领域提供了全面综述，并提出了进一步发展的方向。

Abstract: Ultra-high-definition (UHD) image restoration aims to specifically solve the
problem of quality degradation in ultra-high-resolution images. Recent
advancements in this field are predominantly driven by deep learning-based
innovations, including enhancements in dataset construction, network
architecture, sampling strategies, prior knowledge integration, and loss
functions. In this paper, we systematically review recent progress in UHD image
restoration, covering various aspects ranging from dataset construction to
algorithm design. This serves as a valuable resource for understanding
state-of-the-art developments in the field. We begin by summarizing degradation
models for various image restoration subproblems, such as super-resolution,
low-light enhancement, deblurring, dehazing, deraining, and desnowing, and
emphasizing the unique challenges of their application to UHD image
restoration. We then highlight existing UHD benchmark datasets and organize the
literature according to degradation types and dataset construction methods.
Following this, we showcase major milestones in deep learning-driven UHD image
restoration, reviewing the progression of restoration tasks, technological
developments, and evaluations of existing methods. We further propose a
classification framework based on network architectures and sampling
strategies, helping to clearly organize existing methods. Finally, we share
insights into the current research landscape and propose directions for further
advancements. A related repository is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为RE-TRIP的新型3D地点识别描述符，结合几何测量和反射率信息，提升了在复杂场景中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR地点识别方法仅依赖几何信息，忽略了反射率数据，导致在几何退化、高相似性或动态环境中表现不佳。

Method: 提出RE-TRIP描述符，包括关键点提取、关键实例分割、匹配方法和反射率验证方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，RE-TRIP优于现有方法（如Scan Context、Intensity Scan Context和STD）。

Conclusion: RE-TRIP通过结合几何和反射率信息，显著提升了地点识别的性能。

Abstract: While most people associate LiDAR primarily with its ability to measure
distances and provide geometric information about the environment (via point
clouds), LiDAR also captures additional data, including reflectivity or
intensity values. Unfortunately, when LiDAR is applied to Place Recognition
(PR) in mobile robotics, most previous works on LiDAR-based PR rely only on
geometric measurements, neglecting the additional reflectivity information that
LiDAR provides. In this paper, we propose a novel descriptor for 3D PR, named
RE-TRIP (REflectivity-instance augmented TRIangle descriPtor). This new
descriptor leverages both geometric measurements and reflectivity to enhance
robustness in challenging scenarios such as geometric degeneracy, high
geometric similarity, and the presence of dynamic objects. To implement RE-TRIP
in real-world applications, we further propose (1) a keypoint extraction
method, (2) a key instance segmentation method, (3) a RE-TRIP matching method,
and (4) a reflectivity-combined loop verification method. Finally, we conduct a
series of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of RE-TRIP. Applied to
public datasets (i.e., HELIPR, FusionPortable) containing diverse scenarios
such as long corridors, bridges, large-scale urban areas, and highly dynamic
environments -- our experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Scan Context,
Intensity Scan Context, and STD.

TLDR: TRAIL提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的测试时适应框架，通过结合对抗目标和感知约束生成分布对齐的对抗样本，显著提升了跨模型攻击的迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法因生成的对抗特征与真实数据分布不匹配，导致跨模型迁移性受限。

Method: TRAIL在攻击时更新扩散U-Net权重，结合对抗目标和感知约束，通过迭代噪声注入和去噪生成对抗样本。

Result: 实验表明TRAIL在跨模型攻击迁移性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 分布对齐的对抗特征合成对实际黑盒攻击至关重要。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks exploiting unrestricted natural perturbations present
severe security risks to deep learning systems, yet their transferability
across models remains limited due to distribution mismatches between generated
adversarial features and real-world data. While recent works utilize
pre-trained diffusion models as adversarial priors, they still encounter
challenges due to the distribution shift between the distribution of ideal
adversarial samples and the natural image distribution learned by the diffusion
model. To address the challenge, we propose Transferable Robust Adversarial
Images via Latent Diffusion (TRAIL), a test-time adaptation framework that
enables the model to generate images from a distribution of images with
adversarial features and closely resembles the target images. To mitigate the
distribution shift, during attacks, TRAIL updates the diffusion U-Net's weights
by combining adversarial objectives (to mislead victim models) and perceptual
constraints (to preserve image realism). The adapted model then generates
adversarial samples through iterative noise injection and denoising guided by
these objectives. Experiments demonstrate that TRAIL significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in cross-model attack transferability, validating that
distribution-aligned adversarial feature synthesis is critical for practical
black-box attacks.

*Ping Liu,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文探讨了概念擦除技术是否真正消除了扩散模型生成目标概念的能力，还是仅实现了表面的、特定于提示的抑制。通过系统评估两种代表性方法，发现擦除的概念往往能通过轻微调整重新激活，揭示了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估当前概念擦除技术是否真正移除了生成目标概念的能力，而非仅实现表面的抑制。

Method: 采用实例级评估策略，通过轻量级微调测试擦除概念的重新激活潜力，定量和定性分析两种代表性方法（Unified Concept Editing和Erased Stable Diffusion）。

Result: 结果显示，擦除的概念常能通过轻微调整重新出现，视觉保真度高，表明现有方法未能完全消除潜在生成表示。

Conclusion: 结论指出现有概念擦除方法存在关键局限性，需更深入的表示级干预和更严格的评估标准以实现概念的真正不可逆移除。

Abstract: To what extent does concept erasure eliminate generative capacity in
diffusion models? While prior evaluations have primarily focused on measuring
concept suppression under specific textual prompts, we explore a complementary
and fundamental question: do current concept erasure techniques genuinely
remove the ability to generate targeted concepts, or do they merely achieve
superficial, prompt-specific suppression? We systematically evaluate the
robustness and reversibility of two representative concept erasure methods,
Unified Concept Editing and Erased Stable Diffusion, by probing their ability
to eliminate targeted generative behaviors in text-to-image models. These
methods attempt to suppress undesired semantic concepts by modifying internal
model parameters, either through targeted attention edits or model-level
fine-tuning strategies. To rigorously assess whether these techniques truly
erase generative capacity, we propose an instance-level evaluation strategy
that employs lightweight fine-tuning to explicitly test the reactivation
potential of erased concepts. Through quantitative metrics and qualitative
analyses, we show that erased concepts often reemerge with substantial visual
fidelity after minimal adaptation, indicating that current methods suppress
latent generative representations without fully eliminating them. Our findings
reveal critical limitations in existing concept erasure approaches and
highlight the need for deeper, representation-level interventions and more
rigorous evaluation standards to ensure genuine, irreversible removal of
concepts from generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: QuickVideo通过系统算法协同设计，加速长视频理解，解决解码和预填充瓶颈，支持实时应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解在视频监控、会议总结等应用中至关重要，但现有方法因解码和预填充问题导致高延迟和高内存消耗。

Method: 提出QuickVideo，包含QuickDecoder（并行解码）、QuickPrefill（高效预填充）和CPU-GPU重叠处理。

Result: 实验表明，QuickVideo显著减少推理时间，适用于不同时长和采样率的长视频处理。

Conclusion: QuickVideo通过优化解码和预填充，实现了高效的长视频理解，适用于资源有限的硬件。

Abstract: Long-video understanding has emerged as a crucial capability in real-world
applications such as video surveillance, meeting summarization, educational
lecture analysis, and sports broadcasting. However, it remains computationally
prohibitive for VideoLLMs, primarily due to two bottlenecks: 1) sequential
video decoding, the process of converting the raw bit stream to RGB frames can
take up to a minute for hour-long video inputs, and 2) costly prefilling of up
to several million tokens for LLM inference, resulting in high latency and
memory use. To address these challenges, we propose QuickVideo, a
system-algorithm co-design that substantially accelerates long-video
understanding to support real-time downstream applications. It comprises three
key innovations: QuickDecoder, a parallelized CPU-based video decoder that
achieves 2-3 times speedup by splitting videos into keyframe-aligned intervals
processed concurrently; QuickPrefill, a memory-efficient prefilling method
using KV-cache pruning to support more frames with less GPU memory; and an
overlapping scheme that overlaps CPU video decoding with GPU inference.
Together, these components infernece time reduce by a minute on long video
inputs, enabling scalable, high-quality video understanding even on limited
hardware. Experiments show that QuickVideo generalizes across durations and
sampling rates, making long video processing feasible in practice.

TLDR: Redemption Score是一种新颖的混合框架，通过结合三种互补信号（MID、DINO感知相似性和BERTScore）来评估图像标题，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像标题评估指标未能全面捕捉视觉语义和语言语用学，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 结合三种信号：MID用于全局图像-文本分布对齐，DINO感知相似性用于视觉基础，BERTScore用于上下文文本相似性。

Result: 在Flickr8k基准测试中，Kendall-τ为56.43，优于12种现有方法，且无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: Redemption Score提供了一种更全面、鲁棒的图像标题评估方法，适用于多种数据集。

Abstract: Evaluating image captions requires cohesive assessment of both visual
semantics and language pragmatics, which is often not entirely captured by most
metrics. We introduce Redemption Score, a novel hybrid framework that ranks
image captions by triangulating three complementary signals: (1) Mutual
Information Divergence (MID) for global image-text distributional alignment,
(2) DINO-based perceptual similarity of cycle-generated images for visual
grounding, and (3) BERTScore for contextual text similarity against human
references. A calibrated fusion of these signals allows Redemption Score to
offer a more holistic assessment. On the Flickr8k benchmark, Redemption Score
achieves a Kendall-$\tau$ of 56.43, outperforming twelve prior methods and
demonstrating superior correlation with human judgments without requiring
task-specific training. Our framework provides a more robust and nuanced
evaluation by effectively redeeming image semantics and linguistic
interpretability indicated by strong transfer of knowledge in the Conceptual
Captions and MS COCO datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨用户对图像编辑的需求类型及AI编辑器的实际表现，以改进AI技术。

Method: 分析2013-2025年间Reddit社区的83k个请求及305k个PSR-wizard编辑，对比AI与人类编辑效果。

Result: AI编辑器仅完成33%的请求，低创意任务表现不佳，且VLM评委与人类评委偏好不同。

Conclusion: AI编辑器需改进低创意任务的精确性，并减少非请求的修饰。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) holds significant promise for automating everyday image
editing tasks, especially following the recent release of GPT-4o on March 25,
2025. However, what subjects do people most often want edited? What kinds of
editing actions do they want to perform (e.g., removing or stylizing the
subject)? Do people prefer precise edits with predictable outcomes or highly
creative ones? By understanding the characteristics of real-world requests and
the corresponding edits made by freelance photo-editing wizards, can we draw
lessons for improving AI-based editors and determine which types of requests
can currently be handled successfully by AI editors? In this paper, we present
a unique study addressing these questions by analyzing 83k requests from the
past 12 years (2013-2025) on the Reddit community, which collected 305k
PSR-wizard edits. According to human ratings, approximately only 33% of
requests can be fulfilled by the best AI editors (including GPT-4o,
Gemini-2.0-Flash, SeedEdit). Interestingly, AI editors perform worse on
low-creativity requests that require precise editing than on more open-ended
tasks. They often struggle to preserve the identity of people and animals, and
frequently make non-requested touch-ups. On the other side of the table, VLM
judges (e.g., o1) perform differently from human judges and may prefer AI edits
more than human edits. Code and qualitative examples are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于推理的多模态语言模型在长文本推理链生成上取得一定成功，但在需要动态迭代聚焦视觉区域的任务中表现不足。

Method: 提出VLM-R$^3$框架，结合区域识别与推理能力，采用区域条件强化策略优化（R-GRPO）训练模型。

Result: 在MathVista、ScienceQA等基准测试中，VLM-R$^3$在零样本和少样本设置下达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: VLM-R$^3$显著提升了需要空间推理或细粒度视觉线索提取的任务性能。

Abstract: Recently, reasoning-based MLLMs have achieved a degree of success in
generating long-form textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle
with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on and
revisiting of visual regions to achieve precise grounding of textual reasoning
in visual evidence. We introduce \textbf{VLM-R$^3$} (\textbf{V}isual
\textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel with \textbf{R}egion \textbf{R}ecognition and
\textbf{R}easoning), a framework that equips an MLLM with the ability to (i)
decide \emph{when} additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine
\emph{where} to ground within the image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the
relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved chain-of-thought. The core
of our method is \textbf{Region-Conditioned Reinforcement Policy Optimization
(R-GRPO)}, a training paradigm that rewards the model for selecting informative
regions, formulating appropriate transformations (e.g.\ crop, zoom), and
integrating the resulting visual context into subsequent reasoning steps. To
bootstrap this policy, we compile a modest but carefully curated Visuo-Lingual
Interleaved Rationale (VLIR) corpus that provides step-level supervision on
region selection and textual justification. Extensive experiments on MathVista,
ScienceQA, and other benchmarks show that VLM-R$^3$ sets a new state of the art
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, with the largest gains appearing on
questions demanding subtle spatial reasoning or fine-grained visual cue
extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MedVQA模型存在模态偏好偏差，导致无法有效学习多模态知识，影响临床诊断效率。

Method: 提出MedCFVQA模型，利用因果图在推理阶段消除模态偏好偏差，并重构数据集以解决先验依赖问题。

Result: MedCFVQA在SLAKE、RadVQA及其重构数据集上显著优于非因果模型。

Conclusion: MedCFVQA有效解决了模态偏好偏差问题，提升了MedVQA的性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is crucial for enhancing the
efficiency of clinical diagnosis by providing accurate and timely responses to
clinicians' inquiries regarding medical images. Existing MedVQA models suffered
from modality preference bias, where predictions are heavily dominated by one
modality while overlooking the other (in MedVQA, usually questions dominate the
answer but images are overlooked), thereby failing to learn multimodal
knowledge. To overcome the modality preference bias, we proposed a Medical
CounterFactual VQA (MedCFVQA) model, which trains with bias and leverages
causal graphs to eliminate the modality preference bias during inference.
Existing MedVQA datasets exhibit substantial prior dependencies between
questions and answers, which results in acceptable performance even if the
model significantly suffers from the modality preference bias. To address this
issue, we reconstructed new datasets by leveraging existing MedVQA datasets and
Changed their P3rior dependencies (CP) between questions and their answers in
the training and test set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MedCFVQA
significantly outperforms its non-causal counterpart on both SLAKE, RadVQA and
SLAKE-CP, RadVQA-CP datasets.

Abstract: Total Body Photography (TBP) is becoming a useful screening tool for patients
at high risk for skin cancer. While much progress has been made, existing TBP
systems can be further improved for automatic detection and analysis of
suspicious skin lesions, which is in part related to the resolution and
sharpness of acquired images. This paper proposes a novel shape-aware TBP
system automatically capturing full-body images while optimizing image quality
in terms of resolution and sharpness over the body surface. The system uses
depth and RGB cameras mounted on a 360-degree rotary beam, along with 3D body
shape estimation and an in-focus surface optimization method to select the
optimal focus distance for each camera pose. This allows for optimizing the
focused coverage over the complex 3D geometry of the human body given the
calibrated camera poses. We evaluate the effectiveness of the system in
capturing high-fidelity body images. The proposed system achieves an average
resolution of 0.068 mm/pixel and 0.0566 mm/pixel with approximately 85% and 95%
of surface area in-focus, evaluated on simulation data of diverse body shapes
and poses as well as a real scan of a mannequin respectively. Furthermore, the
proposed shape-aware focus method outperforms existing focus protocols (e.g.

*Yuren Mao,Wenyi Xu,Yuyang Qin,Yunjun Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 本文提出CT-Agent，一种多模态代理框架，用于解决CT影像问答（CTQA）任务中的解剖复杂性和跨切片空间关系问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT扫描生成的三维医学数据对诊断至关重要，但放射科医生撰写报告耗时且易出错，亟需能自动回答问题和生成报告的视觉问答系统。

Method: CT-Agent采用解剖独立工具分解解剖复杂性，并通过全局-局部标记压缩策略高效捕捉跨切片空间关系。

Result: 在CT-RATE和RadGenome-ChestCT两个3D胸部CT数据集上的实验验证了CT-Agent的优越性能。

Conclusion: CT-Agent通过创新方法有效解决了CTQA任务中的关键挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) scan, which produces 3D volumetric medical data that
can be viewed as hundreds of cross-sectional images (a.k.a. slices), provides
detailed anatomical information for diagnosis. For radiologists, creating CT
radiology reports is time-consuming and error-prone. A visual question
answering (VQA) system that can answer radiologists' questions about some
anatomical regions on the CT scan and even automatically generate a radiology
report is urgently needed. However, existing VQA systems cannot adequately
handle the CT radiology question answering (CTQA) task for: (1) anatomic
complexity makes CT images difficult to understand; (2) spatial relationship
across hundreds slices is difficult to capture. To address these issues, this
paper proposes CT-Agent, a multimodal agentic framework for CTQA. CT-Agent
adopts anatomically independent tools to break down the anatomic complexity;
furthermore, it efficiently captures the across-slice spatial relationship with
a global-local token compression strategy. Experimental results on two 3D chest
CT datasets, CT-RATE and RadGenome-ChestCT, verify the superior performance of
CT-Agent.

*Zheng Chen,Zichen Zou,Kewei Zhang,Xiongfei Su,Xin Yuan,Yong Guo,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: DOVE是一种高效的单步扩散模型，用于真实世界视频超分辨率（VSR），通过微调预训练的视频扩散模型（如CogVideoX）实现，显著提升了推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在VSR中表现优异，但推理速度慢。单步采样技术虽能加速，但在VSR中实现单步仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用潜在像素训练策略，分两阶段逐步适应VSR任务，并设计高质量数据集HQ-VSR进行微调。

Result: DOVE性能与多步扩散方法相当或更优，推理速度提升28倍。

Conclusion: DOVE在高效性和性能上均表现突出，为VSR任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated promising performance in real-world video
super-resolution (VSR). However, the dozens of sampling steps they require,
make inference extremely slow. Sampling acceleration techniques, particularly
single-step, provide a potential solution. Nonetheless, achieving one step in
VSR remains challenging, due to the high training overhead on video data and
stringent fidelity demands. To tackle the above issues, we propose DOVE, an
efficient one-step diffusion model for real-world VSR. DOVE is obtained by
fine-tuning a pretrained video diffusion model (*i.e.*, CogVideoX). To
effectively train DOVE, we introduce the latent-pixel training strategy. The
strategy employs a two-stage scheme to gradually adapt the model to the video
super-resolution task. Meanwhile, we design a video processing pipeline to
construct a high-quality dataset tailored for VSR, termed HQ-VSR. Fine-tuning
on this dataset further enhances the restoration capability of DOVE. Extensive
experiments show that DOVE exhibits comparable or superior performance to
multi-step diffusion-based VSR methods. It also offers outstanding inference
efficiency, achieving up to a **28$\times$** speed-up over existing methods
such as MGLD-VSR. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/DOVE.

### [169] [Swin Transformer for Robust CGI Images Detection: Intra- and Inter-Dataset Analysis across Multiple Color Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16253)
*Preeti Mehta,Aman Sagar,Suchi Kumari*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 本研究提出了一种基于Swin Transformer的模型，用于在RGB、YCbCr和HSV三种颜色空间中区分计算机生成图像（CGI）与真实数字图像。模型通过分层架构捕获局部和全局特征，并在多个数据集上验证了其鲁棒性和领域泛化能力。RGB颜色空间表现最佳，模型在检测CGI方面优于传统CNN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类方法在处理CGI的复杂性和变异性方面存在局限性，需要一种更准确的区分方法。

Method: 采用Swin Transformer模型，利用其分层架构提取特征，并通过数据增强和t-SNE可视化验证特征可分性。在多个数据集上进行测试。

Result: RGB颜色空间表现最优，模型在检测CGI方面优于VGG-19和ResNet-50，展示了鲁棒性和领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: Swin Transformer模型在数字图像取证中具有潜力，特别是在区分CGI与自然图像方面，表现出高精度和可靠性。

Abstract: This study aims to address the growing challenge of distinguishing
computer-generated imagery (CGI) from authentic digital images across three
different color spaces; RGB, YCbCr, and HSV. Given the limitations of existing
classification methods in handling the complexity and variability of CGI, this
research proposes a Swin Transformer based model for accurate differentiation
between natural and synthetic images. The proposed model leverages the Swin
Transformer's hierarchical architecture to capture local and global features
for distinguishing CGI from natural images. Its performance was assessed
through intra- and inter-dataset testing across three datasets: CiFAKE, JSSSTU,
and Columbia. The model was evaluated individually on each dataset (D1, D2, D3)
and on the combined datasets (D1+D2+D3) to test its robustness and domain
generalization. To address dataset imbalance, data augmentation techniques were
applied. Additionally, t-SNE visualization was used to demonstrate the feature
separability achieved by the Swin Transformer across the selected color spaces.
The model's performance was tested across all color schemes, with the RGB color
scheme yielding the highest accuracy for each dataset. As a result, RGB was
selected for domain generalization analysis and compared with other CNN-based
models, VGG-19 and ResNet-50. The comparative results demonstrate the proposed
model's effectiveness in detecting CGI, highlighting its robustness and
reliability in both intra-dataset and inter-dataset evaluations. The findings
of this study highlight the Swin Transformer model's potential as an advanced
tool for digital image forensics, particularly in distinguishing CGI from
natural images. The model's strong performance indicates its capability for
domain generalization, making it a valuable asset in scenarios requiring
precise and reliable image classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: DualComp是一种轻量级、统一的双模态（图像和文本）无损压缩器，通过模态统一标记化、模态切换上下文学习和模态路由专家混合等结构增强，实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型压缩器多为单模态设计，缺乏灵活性，而多模态大模型复杂度高，难以实用。

Method: 提出DualComp，结合模态统一标记化、模态切换上下文学习和模态路由专家混合，采用重参数化训练策略。

Result: DualComp在桌面CPU上实现近实时推理（200KB/s），压缩性能与SOTA LLM方法相当，简化单模态版本在Kodak数据集上超越之前最佳图像压缩器9%。

Conclusion: DualComp通过轻量级设计和模态适应策略，实现了高效、灵活的多模态无损压缩。

Abstract: Most learning-based lossless compressors are designed for a single modality,
requiring separate models for multi-modal data and lacking flexibility.
However, different modalities vary significantly in format and statistical
properties, making it ineffective to use compressors that lack
modality-specific adaptations. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
offer a potential solution for modality-unified compression, their excessive
complexity hinders practical deployment. To address these challenges, we focus
on the two most common modalities, image and text, and propose DualComp, the
first unified and lightweight learning-based dual-modality lossless compressor.
Built on a lightweight backbone, DualComp incorporates three key structural
enhancements to handle modality heterogeneity: modality-unified tokenization,
modality-switching contextual learning, and modality-routing
mixture-of-experts. A reparameterization training strategy is also used to
boost compression performance. DualComp integrates both modality-specific and
shared parameters for efficient parameter utilization, enabling near real-time
inference (200KB/s) on desktop CPUs. With much fewer parameters, DualComp
achieves compression performance on par with the SOTA LLM-based methods for
both text and image datasets. Its simplified single-modality variant surpasses
the previous best image compressor on the Kodak dataset by about 9% using just
1.2% of the model size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的线检测方法虽然准确，但推理速度慢且需要在大数据集上预训练注意力机制，限制了其在低延迟视频分析中的应用。

Method: 提出了一种新的注意力机制Deformable Line Attention（DLA），并基于此构建了LINEA方法，无需预训练注意力机制。

Result: LINEA在速度上显著提升，并在分布外数据集测试中优于先前模型的sAP表现。

Conclusion: LINEA通过DLA机制实现了高效且无需预训练的线检测，为低延迟应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Line detection is a basic digital image processing operation used by
higher-level processing methods. Recently, transformer-based methods for line
detection have proven to be more accurate than methods based on CNNs, at the
expense of significantly lower inference speeds. As a result, video analysis
methods that require low latencies cannot benefit from current
transformer-based methods for line detection. In addition, current
transformer-based models require pretraining attention mechanisms on large
datasets (e.g., COCO or Object360). This paper develops a new transformer-based
method that is significantly faster without requiring pretraining the attention
mechanism on large datasets. We eliminate the need to pre-train the attention
mechanism using a new mechanism, Deformable Line Attention (DLA). We use the
term LINEA to refer to our new transformer-based method based on DLA. Extensive
experiments show that LINEA is significantly faster and outperforms previous
models on sAP in out-of-distribution dataset testing.

TLDR: DriveMoE是一个基于Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)架构的端到端自动驾驶框架，通过场景专用视觉MoE和技能专用动作MoE，动态选择相关摄像头和专家模块，实现了多样驾驶场景的高效处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶需要处理多视角感知数据并应对复杂驾驶场景，尤其是罕见操作（如激进转弯）。MoE架构在大型语言模型中的成功表明参数专业化具有强扩展性。

Method: DriveMoE基于Drive-π0框架，添加了视觉MoE（动态选择摄像头）和动作MoE（激活不同驾驶行为的专家模块），模拟人类驾驶的注意力选择机制。

Result: 在Bench2Drive闭环评估实验中，DriveMoE实现了最先进的性能，验证了视觉和动作MoE结合的有效性。

Conclusion: DriveMoE通过专业化设计解决了现有模型的模式平均问题，为自动驾驶任务提供了高效解决方案。代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) demands effective processing of
multi-view sensory data and robust handling of diverse and complex driving
scenarios, particularly rare maneuvers such as aggressive turns. Recent success
of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrates that specialization of parameters enables strong scalability. In
this work, we propose DriveMoE, a novel MoE-based E2E-AD framework, with a
Scene-Specialized Vision MoE and a Skill-Specialized Action MoE. DriveMoE is
built upon our $\pi_0$ Vision-Language-Action (VLA) baseline (originally from
the embodied AI field), called Drive-$\pi_0$. Specifically, we add Vision MoE
to Drive-$\pi_0$ by training a router to select relevant cameras according to
the driving context dynamically. This design mirrors human driving cognition,
where drivers selectively attend to crucial visual cues rather than
exhaustively processing all visual information. In addition, we add Action MoE
by training another router to activate specialized expert modules for different
driving behaviors. Through explicit behavioral specialization, DriveMoE is able
to handle diverse scenarios without suffering from modes averaging like
existing models. In Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation experiments, DriveMoE
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness
of combining vision and action MoE in autonomous driving tasks. We will release
our code and models of DriveMoE and Drive-$\pi_0$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型（LLM）作为交互式GUI代理面临长时动作序列优化和多模态反馈的挑战，现有方法在GUI环境中应用不足。

Method: 提出Agentic Replay Policy Optimization（ARPO），结合GRPO和回放缓冲区，并引入任务选择策略以稳定训练。

Result: 在OSWorld基准测试中，ARPO表现优异，为基于LLM的GUI代理设定了新的性能基准。

Conclusion: 强化学习在训练多轮视觉语言GUI代理方面具有显著效果，适用于复杂UI交互。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) as interactive agents for controlling
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents a unique challenge to optimize
long-horizon action sequences with multimodal feedback from complex
environments. While recent works have advanced multi-turn reinforcement
learning (RL) for reasoning and tool-using capabilities in LLMs, their
application to GUI-based agents remains relatively underexplored due to the
difficulty of sparse rewards, delayed feedback, and high rollout costs. In this
paper, we investigate end-to-end policy optimization for vision-language-based
GUI agents with the aim of improving performance on complex, long-horizon
computer tasks. We propose Agentic Replay Policy Optimization (ARPO), an
end-to-end RL approach that augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with a replay buffer to reuse the successful experience across training
iterations. To further stabilize the training process, we propose a task
selection strategy that filters tasks based on baseline agent performance,
allowing the agent to focus on learning from informative interactions.
Additionally, we compare ARPO with offline preference optimization approaches,
highlighting the advantages of policy-based methods in GUI environments.
Experiments on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that ARPO achieves competitive
results, establishing a new performance baseline for LLM-based GUI agents
trained via reinforcement learning. Our findings underscore the effectiveness
of reinforcement learning for training multi-turn, vision-language GUI agents
capable of managing complex real-world UI interactions. Codes and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在半监督医学图像分割中，标记数据的稀缺限制了原型的表达能力，导致类别嵌入的表示不完整。

Method: 基于Mean-Teacher框架，通过联合不确定性量化和数据增强生成高质量原型，并设计原型网络以减少内存需求。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，EPCL-JUDA优于现有方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: EPCL-JUDA通过增强原型表达和优化伪标签，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Recently, prototype learning has emerged in semi-supervised medical image
segmentation and achieved remarkable performance. However, the scarcity of
labeled data limits the expressiveness of prototypes in previous methods,
potentially hindering the complete representation of prototypes for class
embedding. To overcome this issue, we propose an efficient prototype
consistency learning via joint uncertainty quantification and data augmentation
(EPCL-JUDA) to enhance the semantic expression of prototypes based on the
framework of Mean-Teacher. The concatenation of original and augmented labeled
data is fed into student network to generate expressive prototypes. Then, a
joint uncertainty quantification method is devised to optimize pseudo-labels
and generate reliable prototypes for original and augmented unlabeled data
separately. High-quality global prototypes for each class are formed by fusing
labeled and unlabeled prototypes, which are utilized to generate
prototype-to-features to conduct consistency learning. Notably, a prototype
network is proposed to reduce high memory requirements brought by the
introduction of augmented data. Extensive experiments on Left Atrium,
Pancreas-NIH, Type B Aortic Dissection datasets demonstrate EPCL-JUDA's
superiority over previous state-of-the-art approaches, confirming the
effectiveness of our framework. The code will be released soon.

TLDR: 提出了一种新的弱监督目标检测框架，通过自分类增强模块和自分类校正算法解决多类分类任务中的模糊性问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督目标检测（WSOD）因标注成本低而备受关注，但现有方法在多类分类任务中存在分类模糊性，未能充分利用其优势。

Method: 引入自分类增强模块（ICBC）和自分类校正算法，结合多类分类任务，提升样本区分能力并减少误分类。

Result: 在VOC 2007和2012数据集上的实验表明，该框架性能优越。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了WSOD中的分类模糊性问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: In recent years, weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted much
attention due to its low labeling cost. The success of recent WSOD models is
often ascribed to the two-stage multi-class classification (MCC) task, i.e.,
multiple instance learning and online classification refinement. Despite
achieving non-trivial progresses, these methods overlook potential
classification ambiguities between these two MCC tasks and fail to leverage
their unique strengths. In this work, we introduce a novel WSOD framework to
ameliorate these two issues. For one thing, we propose a self-classification
enhancement module that integrates intra-class binary classification (ICBC) to
bridge the gap between the two distinct MCC tasks. The ICBC task enhances the
network's discrimination between positive and mis-located samples in a
class-wise manner and forges a mutually reinforcing relationship with the MCC
task. For another, we propose a self-classification correction algorithm during
inference, which combines the results of both MCC tasks to effectively reduce
the mis-classified predictions. Extensive experiments on the prevalent VOC 2007
& 2012 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework.

Abstract: To address the challenge of complex pathological feature extraction in
automated cardiac MRI segmentation, this study proposes an innovative
dual-encoder architecture named SAMba-UNet. The framework achieves cross-modal
feature collaborative learning by integrating the vision foundation model SAM2,
the state-space model Mamba, and the classical UNet. To mitigate domain
discrepancies between medical and natural images, a Dynamic Feature Fusion
Refiner is designed, which enhances small lesion feature extraction through
multi-scale pooling and a dual-path calibration mechanism across channel and
spatial dimensions. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Omni-Attention Convergence
Module (HOACM) is introduced, combining global contextual attention with
branch-selective emphasis mechanisms to effectively fuse SAM2's local
positional semantics and Mamba's long-range dependency modeling capabilities.
Experiments on the ACDC cardiac MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.9103 and an HD95 boundary error of 1.0859 mm,
significantly outperforming existing methods, particularly in boundary
localization for complex pathological structures such as right ventricular
anomalies. This work provides an efficient and reliable solution for automated
cardiac disease diagnosis, and the code will be open-sourced.

Recent architectures leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to
transform input images from one domain to another. In this work, we focus on
the study of both paired and unpaired image translation across multiple image
domains. For the paired task, we used a conditional GAN model, and for the
unpaired task, we trained it using cycle consistency loss. We experimented with
different types of loss functions, multiple Patch-GAN sizes, and model
architectures. New quantitative metrics - precision, recall, and FID score -
were used for analysis. In addition, a qualitative study of the results of
different experiments was conducted.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为TEA的新型对抗攻击方法，利用目标图像的边缘信息生成对抗样本，在低查询量下表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的黑盒对抗攻击方法通常仅利用决策边界的几何特性，而忽略了图像本身的信息，导致在特定目标分类任务中效果不佳。

Method: 提出TEA方法，通过利用目标图像的边缘信息，生成更接近源图像但仍能实现目标分类的对抗样本。

Result: TEA在低查询量下（减少近70%查询）优于现有方法，并为几何攻击提供了更好的初始化。

Conclusion: TEA是一种高效的黑盒对抗攻击方法，特别适用于查询受限的实际场景。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for image classification remain vulnerable to
adversarial examples -- small, imperceptible perturbations that induce
misclassifications. In black-box settings, where only the final prediction is
accessible, crafting targeted attacks that aim to misclassify into a specific
target class is particularly challenging due to narrow decision regions.
Current state-of-the-art methods often exploit the geometric properties of the
decision boundary separating a source image and a target image rather than
incorporating information from the images themselves. In contrast, we propose
Targeted Edge-informed Attack (TEA), a novel attack that utilizes edge
information from the target image to carefully perturb it, thereby producing an
adversarial image that is closer to the source image while still achieving the
desired target classification. Our approach consistently outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods across different models in low query settings (nearly
70\% fewer queries are used), a scenario especially relevant in real-world
applications with limited queries and black-box access. Furthermore, by
efficiently generating a suitable adversarial example, TEA provides an improved
target initialization for established geometry-based attacks.

Abstract: As vision-based machine learning models are increasingly integrated into
autonomous and cyber-physical systems, concerns about (physical) adversarial
patch attacks are growing. While state-of-the-art defenses can achieve
certified robustness with minimal impact on utility against highly-concentrated
localized patch attacks, they fall short in two important areas: (i)
State-of-the-art methods are vulnerable to low-noise distributed patches where
perturbations are subtly dispersed to evade detection or masking, as shown
recently by the DorPatch attack; (ii) Achieving high robustness with
state-of-the-art methods is extremely time and resource-consuming, rendering
them impractical for latency-sensitive applications in many cyber-physical
systems.
  To address both robustness and latency issues, this paper proposes a new
defense strategy for adversarial patch attacks called SuperPure. The key
novelty is developing a pixel-wise masking scheme that is robust against both
distributed and localized patches. The masking involves leveraging a GAN-based
super-resolution scheme to gradually purify the image from adversarial patches.
Our extensive evaluations using ImageNet and two standard classifiers, ResNet
and EfficientNet, show that SuperPure advances the state-of-the-art in three
major directions: (i) it improves the robustness against conventional localized
patches by more than 20%, on average, while also improving top-1 clean accuracy
by almost 10%; (ii) It achieves 58% robustness against distributed patch
attacks (as opposed to 0% in state-of-the-art method, PatchCleanser); (iii) It
decreases the defense end-to-end latency by over 98% compared to PatchCleanser.
Our further analysis shows that SuperPure is robust against white-box attacks
and different patch sizes. Our code is open-source.

*Jie Zhao,Xin Chen,Yongsheng Yuan,Michael Felsberg,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种轻量级、即插即用的运动提示跟踪方法，通过结合运动和视觉线索提升跟踪鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪器主要依赖视觉区分性，忽略了视频数据的时序一致性。

Method: 设计了运动编码器（含三种位置编码）、融合解码器和自适应权重机制，动态融合视觉与运动特征。

Result: 在七个挑战性跟踪基准测试中显著提升视觉跟踪器的鲁棒性，训练成本低且速度牺牲极小。

Conclusion: 运动提示模块能高效提升现有视觉跟踪器的性能。

Abstract: Due to the challenges of processing temporal information, most trackers
depend solely on visual discriminability and overlook the unique temporal
coherence of video data. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and
plug-and-play motion prompt tracking method. It can be easily integrated into
existing vision-based trackers to build a joint tracking framework leveraging
both motion and vision cues, thereby achieving robust tracking through
efficient prompt learning. A motion encoder with three different positional
encodings is proposed to encode the long-term motion trajectory into the visual
embedding space, while a fusion decoder and an adaptive weight mechanism are
designed to dynamically fuse visual and motion features. We integrate our
motion module into three different trackers with five models in total.
Experiments on seven challenging tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed motion module significantly improves the robustness of vision-based
trackers, with minimal training costs and negligible speed sacrifice. Code is
available at https://github.com/zj5559/Motion-Prompt-Tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: TensorAR是一种新的自回归范式，通过将图像生成从单令牌预测扩展到张量预测，实现了对生成内容的迭代优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归（AR）图像生成模型缺乏对先前预测的优化机制，限制了生成质量，TensorAR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TensorAR通过滑动窗口生成重叠的图像块（张量），并提出离散张量噪声方案以防止训练中的信息泄漏。

Result: 实验表明，TensorAR显著提升了自回归模型的生成性能。

Conclusion: TensorAR作为一种即插即用模块，为自回归图像生成提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generators offer a language-model-friendly approach
to image generation by predicting discrete image tokens in a causal sequence.
However, unlike diffusion models, AR models lack a mechanism to refine previous
predictions, limiting their generation quality. In this paper, we introduce
TensorAR, a new AR paradigm that reformulates image generation from next-token
prediction to next-tensor prediction. By generating overlapping windows of
image patches (tensors) in a sliding fashion, TensorAR enables iterative
refinement of previously generated content. To prevent information leakage
during training, we propose a discrete tensor noising scheme, which perturbs
input tokens via codebook-indexed noise. TensorAR is implemented as a
plug-and-play module compatible with existing AR models. Extensive experiments
on LlamaGEN, Open-MAGVIT2, and RAR demonstrate that TensorAR significantly
improves the generation performance of autoregressive models.

TLDR: 论文提出全景描述任务（panoptic captioning），旨在生成图像的全面文本描述，并提出数据引擎PancapEngine和方法PancapChain以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在全景描述任务中表现有限，需改进数据和方法以实现更全面的图像描述。

Method: 提出PancapEngine生成高质量数据，PancapChain分阶段生成全景描述，并贡献评估指标PancapScore和测试集。

Result: PancapChain-13B模型超越开源和专有模型（如GPT-4o和Gemini-2.0-Pro），验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PancapEngine和PancapChain为全景描述任务提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: This work introduces panoptic captioning, a novel task striving to seek the
minimum text equivalence of images. We take the first step towards panoptic
captioning by formulating it as a task of generating a comprehensive textual
description for an image, which encapsulates all entities, their respective
locations and attributes, relationships among entities, as well as global image
state.Through an extensive evaluation, our work reveals that state-of-the-art
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have limited performance in solving
panoptic captioning. To address this, we propose an effective data engine named
PancapEngine to produce high-quality data and a novel method named PancapChain
to improve panoptic captioning. Specifically, our PancapEngine first detects
diverse categories of entities in images by an elaborate detection suite, and
then generates required panoptic captions using entity-aware prompts.
Additionally, our PancapChain explicitly decouples the challenging panoptic
captioning task into multiple stages and generates panoptic captions step by
step. More importantly, we contribute a comprehensive metric named PancapScore
and a human-curated test set for reliable model evaluation.Experiments show
that our PancapChain-13B model can beat state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs like
InternVL-2.5-78B and even surpass proprietary models like GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.0-Pro, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data engine and method.

TLDR: FPQVAR是一种高效的浮点量化框架，通过算法和硬件协同设计，显著降低了VAR模型的内存和计算成本，同时提升了图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型在图像生成中表现出色，但其大参数和高计算成本限制了在边缘设备上的部署。FPQVAR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出双格式量化、分组Hadamard变换和GHT感知可学习变换，设计了低比特FP量化器和乘法器，并开发了基于FPGA的加速器。

Result: 在4位量化下，FID从10.83降至3.58，IS从175.9提升至241.5；6位量化性能接近FP16模型。FPGA加速器吞吐量达1.1图像/秒，能效显著提升。

Conclusion: FPQVAR通过算法和硬件优化，显著提升了VAR模型的效率和性能，适合边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling has marked a paradigm shift in image
generation from next-token prediction to next-scale prediction. VAR predicts a
set of tokens at each step from coarse to fine scale, leading to better image
quality and faster inference speed compared to existing diffusion models.
However, the large parameter size and computation cost hinder its deployment on
edge devices. To reduce the memory and computation cost, we propose FPQVAR, an
efficient post-training floating-point (FP) quantization framework for VAR
featuring algorithm and hardware co-design. At the algorithm level, we first
identify the challenges of quantizing VAR. To address them, we propose Dual
Format Quantization for the highly imbalanced input activation. We further
propose Group-wise Hadamard Transformation and GHT-Aware Learnable
Transformation to address the time-varying outlier channels. At the hardware
level, we design the first low-bit FP quantizer and multiplier with lookup
tables on FPGA and propose the first FPGA-based VAR accelerator featuring
low-bit FP computation and an elaborate two-level pipeline. Extensive
experiments show that compared to the state-of-the-art quantization method, our
proposed FPQVAR significantly improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from
10.83 to 3.58, Inception Score (IS) from 175.9 to 241.5 under 4-bit
quantization. FPQVAR also significantly improves the performance of 6-bit
quantized VAR, bringing it on par with the FP16 model. Our accelerator on
AMD-Xilinx VCK190 FPGA achieves a throughput of 1.1 image/s, which is 3.1x
higher than the integer-based accelerator. It also demonstrates 3.6x and 2.8x
higher energy efficiency compared to the integer-based accelerator and GPU
baseline, respectively.

Abstract: Accurate classification of skin lesions from dermatoscopic images is
essential for diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer. In this study, we
investigate the utility of a dermatology-specific foundation model, PanDerm, in
comparison with two Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures (ViT base and Swin
Transformer V2 base) for the task of skin lesion classification. Using frozen
features extracted from PanDerm, we apply non-linear probing with three
different classifiers, namely, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), XGBoost, and
TabNet. For the ViT-based models, we perform full fine-tuning to optimize
classification performance. Our experiments on the HAM10000 and MSKCC datasets
demonstrate that the PanDerm-based MLP model performs comparably to the
fine-tuned Swin transformer model, while fusion of PanDerm and Swin Transformer
predictions leads to further performance improvements. Future work will explore
additional foundation models, fine-tuning strategies, and advanced fusion
techniques.

TLDR: 论文提出两种基于扩散模型的语义一致风格迁移方法（CACTI和CACTIF），用于提升合成数据训练的视觉模型在真实场景中的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 解决合成数据训练的语义分割模型在真实图像中表现不佳的问题，尤其是在标注数据稀缺的恶劣条件下。

Method: 引入CACTI（基于语义类别的自适应实例归一化和交叉注意力）和CACTIF（带选择性注意力过滤的CACTI），通过选择性统计归一化和注意力过滤实现风格迁移。

Result: 实验表明，方法在GTA5到Cityscapes/ACDC的迁移中生成更高质量图像，FID分数更低且内容保留更好。

Conclusion: 类感知的扩散风格迁移能有效缩小合成到真实的领域差距，推动鲁棒感知系统的发展。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic data often perform poorly
on real-world images due to domain gaps, particularly in adverse conditions
where labeled data is scarce. Yet, recent foundation models enable to generate
realistic images without any training. This paper proposes to leverage such
diffusion models to improve the performance of vision models when learned on
synthetic data. We introduce two novel techniques for semantically consistent
style transfer using diffusion models: Class-wise Adaptive Instance
Normalization and Cross-Attention (CACTI) and its extension with selective
attention Filtering (CACTIF). CACTI applies statistical normalization
selectively based on semantic classes, while CACTIF further filters
cross-attention maps based on feature similarity, preventing artifacts in
regions with weak cross-attention correspondences. Our methods transfer style
characteristics while preserving semantic boundaries and structural coherence,
unlike approaches that apply global transformations or generate content without
constraints. Experiments using GTA5 as source and Cityscapes/ACDC as target
domains show that our approach produces higher quality images with lower FID
scores and better content preservation. Our work demonstrates that class-aware
diffusion-based style transfer effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real domain
gap even with minimal target domain data, advancing robust perception systems
for challenging real-world applications. The source code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情因其短暂和局部性难以准确识别，现有方法准确率低，需探索多模态融合技术以提升性能。

Method: 提出TSFmicro框架，整合Retention Network和Transformer网络，采用并行时空融合方法在高维特征空间融合时空信息。

Result: TSFmicro在三个知名微表情数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSFmicro通过高效时空特征融合，显著提升了微表情识别的准确性和语义信息丰富度。

Abstract: When emotions are repressed, an individual's true feelings may be revealed
through micro-expressions. Consequently, micro-expressions are regarded as a
genuine source of insight into an individual's authentic emotions. However, the
transient and highly localised nature of micro-expressions poses a significant
challenge to their accurate recognition, with the accuracy rate of
micro-expression recognition being as low as 50%, even for professionals. In
order to address these challenges, it is necessary to explore the field of
dynamic micro expression recognition (DMER) using multimodal fusion techniques,
with special attention to the diverse fusion of temporal and spatial modal
features. In this paper, we propose a novel Temporal and Spatial feature Fusion
framework for DMER (TSFmicro). This framework integrates a Retention Network
(RetNet) and a transformer-based DMER network, with the objective of efficient
micro-expression recognition through the capture and fusion of temporal and
spatial relations. Meanwhile, we propose a novel parallel time-space fusion
method from the perspective of modal fusion, which fuses spatio-temporal
information in high-dimensional feature space, resulting in complementary
"where-how" relationships at the semantic level and providing richer semantic
information for the model. The experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance of the TSFmicro method in comparison to other contemporary
state-of-the-art methods. This is evidenced by its effectiveness on three
well-recognised micro-expression datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法因计算成本高难以扩展，需高效处理长视频中的大量片段。

Method: 引入轻量级编码器（sidekick encoder）提取密集特征并生成显著性图，再通过专家编码器处理关键片段，结合DeCaf-Grounder统一多尺度特征。

Result: 在基准数据集上，计算量减少47%，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeCafNet在效率和性能上均达到新水平，为长视频时间定位提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Long Video Temporal Grounding (LVTG) aims at identifying specific moments
within lengthy videos based on user-provided text queries for effective content
retrieval. The approach taken by existing methods of dividing video into clips
and processing each clip via a full-scale expert encoder is challenging to
scale due to prohibitive computational costs of processing a large number of
clips in long videos. To address this issue, we introduce DeCafNet, an approach
employing ``delegate-and-conquer'' strategy to achieve computation efficiency
without sacrificing grounding performance. DeCafNet introduces a sidekick
encoder that performs dense feature extraction over all video clips in a
resource-efficient manner, while generating a saliency map to identify the most
relevant clips for full processing by the expert encoder. To effectively
leverage features from sidekick and expert encoders that exist at different
temporal resolutions, we introduce DeCaf-Grounder, which unifies and refines
them via query-aware temporal aggregation and multi-scale temporal refinement
for accurate grounding. Experiments on two LTVG benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DeCafNet reduces computation by up to 47\% while still outperforming
existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art for LTVG in terms of both
efficiency and performance. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有视线估计方法仅预测视线方向或屏幕注视点，无法提供全面的6-DoF信息，且个体差异影响泛化能力。

Result: 在MPIIFaceGaze、EYEDIAP和IMRGaze数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MAGE能够有效预测6-DoF视线信息，适用于真实人机交互场景，且校准模块显著提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Eye gaze can provide rich information on human psychological activities, and
has garnered significant attention in the field of Human-Robot Interaction
(HRI). However, existing gaze estimation methods merely predict either the gaze
direction or the Point-of-Gaze (PoG) on the screen, failing to provide
sufficient information for a comprehensive six Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) gaze
analysis in 3D space. Moreover, the variations of eye shape and structure among
individuals also impede the generalization capability of these methods. In this
study, we propose MAGE, a Multi-task Architecture for Gaze Estimation with an
efficient calibration module, to predict the 6-DoF gaze information that is
applicable for the real-word HRI. Our basic model encodes both the directional
and positional features from facial images, and predicts gaze results with
dedicated information flow and multiple decoders. To reduce the impact of
individual variations, we propose a novel calibration module, namely
Easy-Calibration, to fine-tune the basic model with subject-specific data,
which is efficient to implement without the need of a screen. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the public MPIIFaceGaze, EYEDIAP, and our built IMRGaze datasets.

Conclusion: Sketchy-3DIS框架在粗糙边界框监督下有效提升了3D实例分割性能。

Abstract: Bounding box supervision has gained considerable attention in weakly
supervised 3D instance segmentation. While this approach alleviates the need
for extensive point-level annotations, obtaining accurate bounding boxes in
practical applications remains challenging. To this end, we explore the
inaccurate bounding box, named sketchy bounding box, which is imitated through
perturbing ground truth bounding box by adding scaling, translation, and
rotation. In this paper, we propose Sketchy-3DIS, a novel weakly 3D instance
segmentation framework, which jointly learns pseudo labeler and segmentator to
improve the performance under the sketchy bounding-box supervisions.
Specifically, we first propose an adaptive box-to-point pseudo labeler that
adaptively learns to assign points located in the overlapped parts between two
sketchy bounding boxes to the correct instance, resulting in compact and pure
pseudo instance labels. Then, we present a coarse-to-fine instance segmentator
that first predicts coarse instances from the entire point cloud and then
learns fine instances based on the region of coarse instances. Finally, by
using the pseudo instance labels to supervise the instance segmentator, we can
gradually generate high-quality instances through joint training. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
the ScanNetV2 and S3DIS benchmarks, and even outperforms several fully
supervised methods using sketchy bounding boxes. Code is available at

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are typical complex intelligent systems with artificial
intelligence at their core. However, perception methods based on deep learning
are extremely vulnerable to adversarial samples, resulting in safety accidents.
How to generate effective adversarial examples in the physical world and
evaluate object detection systems is a huge challenge. In this study, we
propose a unified joint adversarial training framework for both 2D and 3D
samples to address the challenges of intra-class diversity and environmental
variations in real-world scenarios. Building upon this framework, we introduce
an adversarial sample reality enhancement approach that incorporates non-rigid
surface modeling and a realistic 3D matching mechanism. We compare with 5
advanced adversarial patches and evaluate their attack performance on 8 object
detecotrs, including single-stage, two-stage, and transformer-based models.
Extensive experiment results in digital and physical environments demonstrate
that the adversarial textures generated by our method can effectively mislead
the target detection model. Moreover, proposed method demonstrates excellent
robustness and transferability under multi-angle attacks, varying lighting
conditions, and different distance in the physical world. The demo video and

Motivation: LVLM在生成文本时经常出现与视觉内容不符的幻觉现象，现有方法在减少幻觉时会导致延迟显著增加。

Conclusion: SPIN是一种高效且无需额外开销的幻觉抑制方法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable progress in multimodal understanding tasks, large
vision language models (LVLMs) often suffer from "hallucinations", generating
texts misaligned with the visual context. Existing methods aimed at reducing
hallucinations through inference time intervention incur a significant increase
in latency. To mitigate this, we present SPIN, a task-agnostic attention-guided
head suppression strategy that can be seamlessly integrated during inference,
without incurring any significant compute or latency overhead. We investigate
whether hallucination in LVLMs can be linked to specific model components. Our
analysis suggests that hallucinations can be attributed to a dynamic subset of
attention heads in each layer. Leveraging this insight, for each text query
token, we selectively suppress attention heads that exhibit low attention to
image tokens, keeping the top-K attention heads intact. Extensive evaluations
on visual question answering and image description tasks demonstrate the
efficacy of SPIN in reducing hallucination scores up to 2.7x while maintaining
F1, and improving throughput by 1.8x compared to existing alternatives. Code is

Abstract: Pose-invariant face recognition has become a challenging problem for modern
AI-based face recognition systems. It aims at matching a profile face captured
in the wild with a frontal face registered in a database. Existing methods
perform face frontalization via either generative models or learning a pose
robust feature representation. In this paper, a new method is presented to
perform face frontalization and recognition within the feature space. First, a
novel feature space pose frontalization module (FSPFM) is proposed to transform
profile images with arbitrary angles into frontal counterparts. Second, a new
training paradigm is proposed to maximize the potential of FSPFM and boost its
performance. The latter consists of a pre-training and an attention-guided
fine-tuning stage. Moreover, extensive experiments have been conducted on five
popular face recognition benchmarks. Results show that not only our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art in the pose-invariant face recognition task
but also maintains superior performance in other standard scenarios.

Result: 实验表明，Circle-RoPE有效减少位置偏差并保留图像空间信息。

Conclusion: Circle-RoPE为视觉语言模型提供了更鲁棒和灵活的位置编码框架。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is a widely adopted technique for encoding
relative positional information in large language models (LLMs). However, when
extended to large vision-language models (LVLMs), its variants introduce
unintended cross-modal positional biases. Specifically, they enforce relative
positional dependencies between text token indices and image tokens, causing
spurious alignments. This issue arises because image tokens representing the
same content but located at different spatial positions are assigned distinct
positional biases, leading to inconsistent cross-modal associations. To address
this, we propose Per-Token Distance (PTD) - a simple yet effective metric for
quantifying the independence of positional encodings across modalities.
Informed by this analysis, we introduce Circle-RoPE, a novel encoding scheme
that maps image token indices onto a circular trajectory orthogonal to the
linear path of text token indices, forming a cone-like structure. This
configuration ensures that each text token maintains an equal distance to all
image tokens, reducing artificial cross-modal biases while preserving
intra-image spatial information. To further enhance performance, we propose a
staggered layer strategy that applies different RoPE variants across layers.
This design leverages the complementary strengths of each RoPE variant, thereby
enhancing the model's overall performance. Our experimental results demonstrate
that our method effectively preserves spatial information from images while
reducing relative positional bias, offering a more robust and flexible
positional encoding framework for LVLMs. The code is available at

Motivation: 研究人类如何获取物体内部表征的机制，并利用深度神经网络（DNNs）作为工具，探讨不同训练范式下模型表征与人类表征的相似性。

Method: 采用基于Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输的无监督对齐方法，比较人类与模型在细粒度和粗粒度水平上的物体表征。

Result: CLIP训练的模型在细粒度和粗粒度水平上与人类表征匹配度高，而自监督模型仅在粗粒度上形成与人类相似的类别结构。

Conclusion: 语言信息在获取精确物体表征中起重要作用，自监督学习在捕捉粗粒度类别结构方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The learning mechanisms by which humans acquire internal representations of
objects are not fully understood. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a
useful tool for investigating this question, as they have internal
representations similar to those of humans as a byproduct of optimizing their
objective functions. While previous studies have shown that models trained with
various learning paradigms - such as supervised, self-supervised, and CLIP -
acquire human-like representations, it remains unclear whether their similarity
to human representations is primarily at a coarse category level or extends to
finer details. Here, we employ an unsupervised alignment method based on
Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport to compare human and model object
representations at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. The unique
feature of this method compared to conventional representational similarity
analysis is that it estimates optimal fine-grained mappings between the
representation of each object in human and model representations. We used this
unsupervised alignment method to assess the extent to which the representation
of each object in humans is correctly mapped to the corresponding
representation of the same object in models. Using human similarity judgments
of 1,854 objects from the THINGS dataset, we find that models trained with CLIP
consistently achieve strong fine- and coarse-grained matching with human object
representations. In contrast, self-supervised models showed limited matching at
both fine- and coarse-grained levels, but still formed object clusters that
reflected human coarse category structure. Our results offer new insights into
the role of linguistic information in acquiring precise object representations
and the potential of self-supervised learning to capture coarse categorical
structures.

Conclusion: FPWC通过前瞻性规划和世界模型显著提升移动设备自动控制性能。

Abstract: The automatic control of mobile devices is essential for efficiently
performing complex tasks that involve multiple sequential steps. However, these
tasks pose significant challenges due to the limited environmental information
available at each step, primarily through visual observations. As a result,
current approaches, which typically rely on reactive policies, focus solely on
immediate observations and often lead to suboptimal decision-making. To address
this problem, we propose \textbf{Foresighted Planning with World Model-Driven
Code Execution (FPWC)},a framework that prioritizes natural language
understanding and structured reasoning to enhance the agent's global
understanding of the environment by developing a task-oriented, refinable
\emph{world model} at the outset of the task. Foresighted actions are
subsequently generated through iterative planning within this world model,
executed in the form of executable code. Extensive experiments conducted in
simulated environments and on real mobile devices demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous approaches, particularly achieving a 44.4\% relative
improvement in task success rate compared to the state-of-the-art in the
simulated environment. Code and demo are provided in the supplementary

Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在利用时间信息时难以保持时间一致性，且依赖精确的光流估计。

Method: JFFRA通过迭代优化光流和特征修复，结合多尺度处理和遮挡感知损失函数。

Result: 在去噪、去模糊和超分辨率任务中，性能提升高达1.62 dB。

Conclusion: JFFRA通过协同优化光流和特征修复，显著提升了视频修复效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video restoration have focused on recovering
high-quality video frames from low-quality inputs. Compared with static images,
the performance of video restoration significantly depends on efficient
exploitation of temporal correlations among successive video frames. The
numerous techniques make use of temporal information via flow-based strategies
or recurrent architectures. However, these methods often encounter difficulties
in preserving temporal consistency as they utilize degraded input video frames.
To resolve this issue, we propose a novel video restoration framework named
Joint Flow and Feature Refinement using Attention (JFFRA). The proposed JFFRA
is based on key philosophy of iteratively enhancing data through the
synergistic collaboration of flow (alignment) and restoration. By leveraging
previously enhanced features to refine flow and vice versa, JFFRA enables
efficient feature enhancement using temporal information. This interplay
between flow and restoration is executed at multiple scales, reducing the
dependence on precise flow estimation. Moreover, we incorporate an
occlusion-aware temporal loss function to enhance the network's capability in
eliminating flickering artifacts. Comprehensive experiments validate the
versatility of JFFRA across various restoration tasks such as denoising,
deblurring, and super-resolution. Our method demonstrates a remarkable
performance improvement of up to 1.62 dB compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

Motivation: 测试时适应在现实环境中在线学习的需求日益增长，但熵最小化方法在持续适应中容易导致模型崩溃。

Method: 通过渐进掩码策略结构化预测难度，逐步对齐模型在不同难度级别的概率分布，同时保持熵的排名顺序。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 排名熵最小化方法显著提升了测试时适应的稳定性，适用于持续场景。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to adapt to realistic environments in an online
manner by learning during test time. Entropy minimization has emerged as a
principal strategy for test-time adaptation due to its efficiency and
adaptability. Nevertheless, it remains underexplored in continual test-time
adaptation, where stability is more important. We observe that the entropy
minimization method often suffers from model collapse, where the model
converges to predicting a single class for all images due to a trivial
solution. We propose ranked entropy minimization to mitigate the stability
problem of the entropy minimization method and extend its applicability to
continuous scenarios. Our approach explicitly structures the prediction
difficulty through a progressive masking strategy. Specifically, it gradually
aligns the model's probability distributions across different levels of
prediction difficulty while preserving the rank order of entropy. The proposed
method is extensively evaluated across various benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness through empirical results. Our code is available at

Conclusion: MAFE R-CNN通过多线索样本选择和特征增强显著提升了小物体检测性能。

Abstract: Small object detection in intricate environments has consistently represented
a major challenge in the field of object detection. In this paper, we identify
that this difficulty stems from the detectors' inability to effectively learn
discriminative features for objects of small size, compounded by the complexity
of selecting high-quality small object samples during training, which motivates
the proposal of the Multi-Clue Assignment and Feature Enhancement
R-CNN.Specifically, MAFE R-CNN integrates two pivotal components.The first is
the Multi-Clue Sample Selection (MCSS) strategy, in which the Intersection over
Union (IoU) distance, predicted category confidence, and ground truth region
sizes are leveraged as informative clues in the sample selection process. This
methodology facilitates the selection of diverse positive samples and ensures a
balanced distribution of object sizes during training, thereby promoting
effective model learning.The second is the Category-aware Feature Enhancement
Mechanism (CFEM), where we propose a simple yet effective category-aware memory
module to explore the relationships among object features. Subsequently, we
enhance the object feature representation by facilitating the interaction
between category-aware features and candidate box features.Comprehensive
experiments conducted on the large-scale small object dataset SODA validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该模型为心脏功能评估提供了一种更高效和准确的方法，有望改善心血管疾病的预后估计。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient quantification of cardiac function is essential for
the estimation of prognosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). One of the most
commonly used metrics for evaluating cardiac pumping performance is left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, LVEF can be affected by factors
such as inter-observer variability and varying pre-load and after-load
conditions, which can reduce its reproducibility. Additionally, cardiac
dysfunction may not always manifest as alterations in LVEF, such as in heart
failure and cardiotoxicity diseases. An alternative measure that can provide a
relatively load-independent quantitative assessment of myocardial contractility
is myocardial strain and strain rate. By using LVEF in combination with
myocardial strain, it is possible to obtain a thorough description of cardiac
function. Automated estimation of LVEF and other volumetric measures from
cine-MRI sequences can be achieved through segmentation models, while strain
calculation requires the estimation of tissue displacement between sequential
frames, which can be accomplished using registration models. These tasks are
often performed separately, potentially limiting the assessment of cardiac
function. To address this issue, in this study we propose an end-to-end deep
learning (DL) model that jointly estimates groupwise (GW) registration and
segmentation for cardiac cine-MRI images. The proposed anatomically-guided Deep
GW network was trained and validated on a large dataset of 4-chamber view
cine-MRI image series of 374 subjects. A quantitative comparison with
conventional GW registration using elastix and two DL-based methods showed that
the proposed model improved performance and substantially reduced computation
time.

Result: MAGIC在推理准确性和时间一致性上优于现有物理感知生成方法和视频扩散模型。

Conclusion: MAGIC提供了一种无需监督或调优的物理合理动态生成方案，解决了视觉与物理的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in static 3D generation have intensified the demand for
physically consistent dynamic 3D content. However, existing video generation
models, including diffusion-based methods, often prioritize visual realism
while neglecting physical plausibility, resulting in implausible object
dynamics. Prior approaches for physics-aware dynamic generation typically rely
on large-scale annotated datasets or extensive model fine-tuning, which imposes
significant computational and data collection burdens and limits scalability
across scenarios. To address these challenges, we present MAGIC, a
training-free framework for single-image physical property inference and
dynamic generation, integrating pretrained image-to-video diffusion models with
iterative LLM-based reasoning. Our framework generates motion-rich videos from
a static image and closes the visual-to-physical gap through a
confidence-driven LLM feedback loop that adaptively steers the diffusion model
toward physics-relevant motion. To translate visual dynamics into controllable
physical behavior, we further introduce a differentiable MPM simulator
operating directly on 3D Gaussians reconstructed from the single image,
enabling physically grounded, simulation-ready outputs without any supervision
or model tuning. Experiments show that MAGIC outperforms existing physics-aware
generative methods in inference accuracy and achieves greater temporal
coherence than state-of-the-art video diffusion models.

Result: 在ImageNet分类中提升9.0%准确率或减少46.7%FLOPs，COCO检测中mAP提升81.3%。

Conclusion: AnchorFormer高效且性能优越，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance on
vision tasks by measuring the global self-attention among the image patches.
Given $n$ patches, they will have quadratic complexity such as
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and the time cost is high when splitting the input image
with a small granularity. Meanwhile, the pivotal information is often randomly
gathered in a few regions of an input image, some tokens may not be helpful for
the downstream tasks. To handle this problem, we introduce an anchor-based
efficient vision transformer (AnchorFormer), which employs the anchor tokens to
learn the pivotal information and accelerate the inference. Firstly, by
estimating the bipartite attention between the anchors and tokens, the
complexity will be reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$, where
$m$ is an anchor number and $m < n$. Notably, by representing the anchors with
the neurons in a neural layer, we can differentiable learn these distributions
and approximate global self-attention through the Markov process. Moreover, we
extend the proposed model to three downstream tasks including classification,
detection, and segmentation. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of
our AnchorFormer, e.g., achieving up to a 9.0% higher accuracy or 46.7% FLOPs
reduction on ImageNet classification, 81.3% higher mAP on COCO detection under
comparable FLOPs, as compared to the current baselines.

Result: 在机器人视频预测和科学时空预测实验中，ForeDiff在预测准确性和样本一致性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ForeDiff为扩散模型在世界建模中的应用提供了新方向，显著提升了一致性表现。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based models have enabled significant progress in
generation tasks across various modalities and have recently found applications
in world modeling. However, unlike typical generation tasks that encourage
sample diversity, world models entail different sources of uncertainty and
require consistent samples aligned with the ground-truth trajectory, which is a
limitation we empirically observe in diffusion models. We argue that a key
bottleneck in learning consistent diffusion-based world models lies in the
suboptimal predictive ability, which we attribute to the entanglement of
condition understanding and target denoising within shared architectures and
co-training schemes. To address this, we propose Foresight Diffusion
(ForeDiff), a diffusion-based world modeling framework that enhances
consistency by decoupling condition understanding from target denoising.
ForeDiff incorporates a separate deterministic predictive stream to process
conditioning inputs independently of the denoising stream, and further
leverages a pretrained predictor to extract informative representations that
guide generation. Extensive experiments on robot video prediction and
scientific spatiotemporal forecasting show that ForeDiff improves both
predictive accuracy and sample consistency over strong baselines, offering a
promising direction for diffusion-based world models.

Conclusion: AllWeatherNight数据集和ClearNight框架对多天气夜间图像恢复具有重要价值。

Abstract: Restoring nighttime images affected by multiple adverse weather conditions is
a practical yet under-explored research problem, as multiple weather conditions
often coexist in the real world alongside various lighting effects at night.
This paper first explores the challenging multi-weather nighttime image
restoration task, where various types of weather degradations are intertwined
with flare effects. To support the research, we contribute the AllWeatherNight
dataset, featuring large-scale high-quality nighttime images with diverse
compositional degradations, synthesized using our introduced illumination-aware
degradation generation. Moreover, we present ClearNight, a unified nighttime
image restoration framework, which effectively removes complex degradations in
one go. Specifically, ClearNight extracts Retinex-based dual priors and
explicitly guides the network to focus on uneven illumination regions and
intrinsic texture contents respectively, thereby enhancing restoration
effectiveness in nighttime scenarios. In order to better represent the common
and unique characters of multiple weather degradations, we introduce a
weather-aware dynamic specific-commonality collaboration method, which
identifies weather degradations and adaptively selects optimal candidate units
associated with specific weather types. Our ClearNight achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world images.
Comprehensive ablation experiments validate the necessity of AllWeatherNight

Abstract: The problems that tobacco workshops encounter include poor curing,
inconsistencies in supplies, irregular scheduling, and a lack of oversight, all
of which drive up expenses and worse quality. Large quantities make manual
examination costly, sluggish, and unreliable. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently made strides in capabilities that transcend those of
conventional methods. To effectively enhance them, nevertheless, extensive
customization is needed to account for subtle variations in tobacco grade. This
study introduces InspectionV3, an integrated solution for automated flue-cured
tobacco grading that makes use of a customized deep convolutional neural
network architecture. A scope that covers color, maturity, and curing
subtleties is established via a labelled dataset consisting of 21,113 images
spanning 20 quality classes. Expert annotators performed preprocessing on the
tobacco leaf images, including cleaning, labelling, and augmentation.
Multi-layer CNN factors use batch normalization to describe domain properties
like as permeability and moisture spots, and so account for the subtleties of
the workshop. Its expertise lies in converting visual patterns into useful
information for enhancing workflow. Fast notifications are made possible by
real-time, on-the-spot grading that matches human expertise. Images-powered
analytics dashboards facilitate the tracking of yield projections, inventories,
bottlenecks, and the optimization of data-driven choices. More labelled images
are assimilated after further retraining, improving representational capacities
and enabling adaptations for seasonal variability. Metrics demonstrate 97%
accuracy, 95% precision and recall, 96% F1-score and AUC, 95% specificity;

Conclusion: DigiShield通过细粒度分析合成视频中面部特征的时序演化，有效识别隐蔽伪影。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of deepfake technology has given rise
to an emerging and serious threat to public security: diffusion model-based
digital human generation. Unlike traditional face manipulation methods, such
models can generate highly realistic videos with consistency through multimodal
control signals. Their flexibility and covertness pose severe challenges to
existing detection strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DigiFakeAV, the
first large-scale multimodal digital human forgery dataset based on diffusion
models. Employing five latest digital human generation methods (Sonic, Hallo,
etc.) and voice cloning method, we systematically produce a dataset comprising
60,000 videos (8.4 million frames), covering multiple nationalities, skin
tones, genders, and real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing data
diversity and realism. User studies show that the confusion rate between forged
and real videos reaches 68%, and existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection
models exhibit large drops in AUC values on DigiFakeAV, highlighting the
challenge of the dataset. To address this problem, we further propose
DigiShield, a detection baseline based on spatiotemporal and cross-modal
fusion. By jointly modeling the 3D spatiotemporal features of videos and the
semantic-acoustic features of audio, DigiShield achieves SOTA performance on
both the DigiFakeAV and DF-TIMIT datasets. Experiments show that this method
effectively identifies covert artifacts through fine-grained analysis of the
temporal evolution of facial features in synthetic videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 塑料回收率低（仅8%），主要因污染、经济激励不足和技术难题。自动分拣是关键，但现有光学识别技术在实际应用中效果不佳。

Method: 研究通过20,000多张图像数据集，结合公共和自定义机器学习流程，评估光学识别能力。使用Grad-CAM、显著性图和混淆矩阵分析模型行为。

Result: 光学识别方法在现实塑料分拣中效果有限，因其依赖颜色和形状等物理特性。

Conclusion: 光学识别技术需改进以应对现实分拣挑战，未来研究应关注更全面的识别方法。

Abstract: According to the EPA, only 25% of waste is recycled, and just 60% of U.S.
municipalities offer curbside recycling. Plastics fare worse, with a recycling
rate of only 8%; an additional 16% is incinerated, while the remaining 76% ends
up in landfills. The low plastic recycling rate stems from contamination, poor
economic incentives, and technical difficulties, making efficient recycling a
challenge. To improve recovery, automated sorting plays a critical role.
Companies like AMP Robotics and Greyparrot utilize optical systems for sorting,
while Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs) employ Near-Infrared (NIR) sensors
to detect plastic types.
  Modern optical sorting uses advances in computer vision such as object
recognition and instance segmentation, powered by machine learning. Two-stage
detectors like Mask R-CNN use region proposals and classification with deep
backbones like ResNet. Single-stage detectors like YOLO handle detection in one
pass, trading some accuracy for speed. While such methods excel under ideal
conditions with a large volume of labeled training data, challenges arise in
realistic scenarios, emphasizing the need to further examine the efficacy of
optic detection for automated sorting.
  In this study, we compiled novel datasets totaling 20,000+ images from varied
sources. Using both public and custom machine learning pipelines, we assessed
the capabilities and limitations of optical recognition for sorting. Grad-CAM,
saliency maps, and confusion matrices were employed to interpret model
behavior. We perform this analysis on our custom trained models from the
compiled datasets. To conclude, our findings are that optic recognition methods
have limited success in accurate sorting of real-world plastics at MRFs,
primarily because they rely on physical properties such as color and shape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有测试时适应方法在高方差任务中优化不稳定和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 利用源模型的倒数第二层特征生成低维指纹，构建键值码本，并使用岭杠杆得分计算合并系数。

Result: 在nuScenes-C上NDS提升14.9%，在nuScenes-to-KITTI上mAP提升7.6%，且无需训练即可提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: CodeMerge提供了一种高效且稳定的模型合并方法，显著提升了3D感知任务的性能。

Abstract: Maintaining robust 3D perception under dynamic and unpredictable test-time
conditions remains a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems.
Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often fail in high-variance tasks
like 3D object detection due to unstable optimization and sharp minima. While
recent model merging strategies based on linear mode connectivity (LMC) offer
improved stability by interpolating between fine-tuned checkpoints, they are
computationally expensive, requiring repeated checkpoint access and multiple
forward passes. In this paper, we introduce CodeMerge, a lightweight and
scalable model merging framework that bypasses these limitations by operating
in a compact latent space. Instead of loading full models, CodeMerge represents
each checkpoint with a low-dimensional fingerprint derived from the source
model's penultimate features and constructs a key-value codebook. We compute
merging coefficients using ridge leverage scores on these fingerprints,
enabling efficient model composition without compromising adaptation quality.
Our method achieves strong performance across challenging benchmarks, improving
end-to-end 3D detection 14.9% NDS on nuScenes-C and LiDAR-based detection by
over 7.6% mAP on nuScenes-to-KITTI, while benefiting downstream tasks such as
online mapping, motion prediction and planning even without training. Code and
pretrained models are released in the supplementary material.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种名为Compact Gaussian Streaming (ComGS)的新框架，通过关键点驱动的运动表示，显著降低了动态场景在线重建的存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线自由视点视频（FVV）重建方法因逐点建模导致存储需求过高，无法充分利用运动特性。

Method: ComGS利用动态场景中运动的局部性和一致性，通过关键点驱动的运动表示建模对象一致的高斯点运动，仅传输关键点属性以减少存储。具体包括：1）使用视空间梯度差异策略定位运动区域中的稀疏关键点；2）提出自适应运动驱动机制预测空间影响场，传播关键点运动；3）采用误差感知校正策略选择性优化关键帧重建。

Result: ComGS实现了显著的存储降低（相比3DGStream减少159倍，相比QUEEN减少14倍），同时保持视觉保真度和渲染速度。

Conclusion: ComGS为动态场景在线重建提供了一种高效且存储友好的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a high-fidelity and efficient
paradigm for online free-viewpoint video (FVV) reconstruction, offering viewers
rapid responsiveness and immersive experiences. However, existing online
methods face challenge in prohibitive storage requirements primarily due to
point-wise modeling that fails to exploit the motion properties. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel Compact Gaussian Streaming (ComGS)
framework, leveraging the locality and consistency of motion in dynamic scene,
that models object-consistent Gaussian point motion through keypoint-driven
motion representation. By transmitting only the keypoint attributes, this
framework provides a more storage-efficient solution. Specifically, we first
identify a sparse set of motion-sensitive keypoints localized within motion
regions using a viewspace gradient difference strategy. Equipped with these
keypoints, we propose an adaptive motion-driven mechanism that predicts a
spatial influence field for propagating keypoint motion to neighboring Gaussian
points with similar motion. Moreover, ComGS adopts an error-aware correction
strategy for key frame reconstruction that selectively refines erroneous
regions and mitigates error accumulation without unnecessary overhead. Overall,
ComGS achieves a remarkable storage reduction of over 159 X compared to
3DGStream and 14 X compared to the SOTA method QUEEN, while maintaining
competitive visual fidelity and rendering speed. Our code will be released.

TLDR: 提出一种动态3D场景重建框架，结合三平面变形场、SH注意力机制和潜在扩散先验，实现高效时空表示和高质量渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态3D场景重建中时空表示效率低、运动建模复杂的问题，并提升渲染质量和泛化能力。

Method: 使用三平面变形场编码4D场景，SH注意力机制优化渲染，潜在扩散模块增强时空一致性。

Result: 在合成基准测试中表现优异，超越HexPlane和4D Gaussian Splatting。

Conclusion: 该框架在动态场景重建中实现了高效、高质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction that
integrates three key components: an explicit tri-plane deformation field, a
view-conditioned canonical radiance field with spherical harmonics (SH)
attention, and a temporally-aware latent diffusion prior. Our method encodes 4D
scenes using three orthogonal 2D feature planes that evolve over time, enabling
efficient and compact spatiotemporal representation. These features are
explicitly warped into a canonical space via a deformation offset field,
eliminating the need for MLP-based motion modeling.
  In canonical space, we replace traditional MLP decoders with a structured
SH-based rendering head that synthesizes view-dependent color via attention
over learned frequency bands improving both interpretability and rendering
efficiency. To further enhance fidelity and temporal consistency, we introduce
a transformer-guided latent diffusion module that refines the tri-plane and
deformation features in a compressed latent space. This generative module
denoises scene representations under ambiguous or out-of-distribution (OOD)
motion, improving generalization.
  Our model is trained in two stages: the diffusion module is first pre-trained
independently, and then fine-tuned jointly with the full pipeline using a
combination of image reconstruction, diffusion denoising, and temporal
consistency losses. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on synthetic
benchmarks, surpassing recent methods such as HexPlane and 4D Gaussian
Splatting in visual quality, temporal coherence, and robustness to sparse-view
dynamic inputs.

TLDR: TextureSAM是一种针对纹理主导场景优化的分割模型，通过纹理增强技术改进SAM模型，显著提升了纹理分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型在语义分割任务中表现优异，但对纹理特征的关注不足，限制了其在医学影像、材料分类等领域的应用。

Method: 采用纹理增强技术对ADE20K数据集进行修改，通过微调方法训练TextureSAM，使其更关注纹理特征。

Result: TextureSAM在自然和合成纹理数据集上的性能显著优于SAM-2（分别提升0.2和0.18 mIoU）。

Conclusion: TextureSAM有效解决了SAM模型对形状偏好的问题，为纹理主导场景提供了更优的分割解决方案。

Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAM) have achieved remarkable success in object
segmentation tasks across diverse datasets. However, these models are
predominantly trained on large-scale semantic segmentation datasets, which
introduce a bias toward object shape rather than texture cues in the image.
This limitation is critical in domains such as medical imaging, material
classification, and remote sensing, where texture changes define object
boundaries. In this study, we investigate SAM's bias toward semantics over
textures and introduce a new texture-aware foundation model, TextureSAM, which
performs superior segmentation in texture-dominant scenarios. To achieve this,
we employ a novel fine-tuning approach that incorporates texture augmentation
techniques, incrementally modifying training images to emphasize texture
features. By leveraging a novel texture-alternation of the ADE20K dataset, we
guide TextureSAM to prioritize texture-defined regions, thereby mitigating the
inherent shape bias present in the original SAM model. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that TextureSAM significantly outperforms SAM-2 on both
natural (+0.2 mIoU) and synthetic (+0.18 mIoU) texture-based segmentation
datasets. The code and texture-augmented dataset will be publicly available.

Conclusion: Auto-nnU-Net显著改进医学图像分割性能，适用于资源受限的实际场景。

Abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) includes diverse tasks, from bone to organ
segmentation, each with its own challenges in finding the best segmentation
model. The state-of-the-art AutoML-related MIS-framework nnU-Net automates many
aspects of model configuration but remains constrained by fixed hyperparameters
and heuristic design choices. As a full-AutoML framework for MIS, we propose
Auto-nnU-Net, a novel nnU-Net variant enabling hyperparameter optimization
(HPO), neural architecture search (NAS), and hierarchical NAS (HNAS).
Additionally, we propose Regularized PriorBand to balance model accuracy with
the computational resources required for training, addressing the resource
constraints often faced in real-world medical settings that limit the
feasibility of extensive training procedures. We evaluate our approach across
diverse MIS datasets from the well-established Medical Segmentation Decathlon,
analyzing the impact of AutoML techniques on segmentation performance,
computational efficiency, and model design choices. The results demonstrate
that our AutoML approach substantially improves the segmentation performance of
nnU-Net on 6 out of 10 datasets and is on par on the other datasets while
maintaining practical resource requirements. Our code is available at

Abstract: We tackle the problem of monocular-to-stereo video conversion and propose a
novel architecture for inpainting and refinement of the warped right view
obtained by depth-based reprojection of the input left view. We extend the
Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) model to utilize the input left video, the warped
right video, and the disocclusion masks as conditioning input to generate a
high-quality right camera view. In order to effectively exploit information
from neighboring frames for inpainting, we modify the attention layers in SVD
to compute full attention for discoccluded pixels. Our model is trained to
generate the right view video in an end-to-end manner by minimizing image space
losses to ensure high-quality generation. Our approach outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods, obtaining an average rank of 1.43 among the 4

Abstract: Video captioning models have seen notable advancements in recent years,
especially with regard to their ability to capture temporal information. While
many research efforts have focused on architectural advancements, such as
temporal attention mechanisms, there remains a notable gap in understanding how
models capture and utilize temporal semantics for effective temporal feature
extraction, especially in the context of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. We
propose an automated LiDAR-based captioning procedure that focuses on the
temporal dynamics of traffic participants. Our approach uses a rule-based
system to extract essential details such as lane position and relative motion
from object tracks, followed by a template-based caption generation. Our
findings show that training SwinBERT, a video captioning model, using only
front camera images and supervised with our template-based captions,
specifically designed to encapsulate fine-grained temporal behavior, leads to
improved temporal understanding consistently across three datasets. In
conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that integrating LiDAR-based
caption supervision significantly enhances temporal understanding, effectively
addressing and reducing the inherent visual/static biases prevalent in current
state-of-the-art model architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 本文提出了一种新的平面单应性几何参数化方法，通过相似-核-相似（SKS）分解，避免了传统方法中需要解线性系统的问题，并保持了与四角位置偏移相当的估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于四角位置偏移的单应性参数化缺乏几何解释性且需要解线性系统，因此需要一种更直观且高效的方法。

Method: 利用相似-核-相似（SKS）分解，将单应性矩阵分解为两组独立的几何参数：一组用于相似变换，另一组用于核变换，并推导了核变换参数与角度偏移的线性关系。

Result: 提出的参数化方法可以直接通过矩阵乘法估计单应性，无需解线性系统，且在深度单应性估计中性能与四角位置偏移相当。

Conclusion: 新的几何参数化方法在保持性能的同时，提供了更高的几何解释性和计算效率。

Abstract: Planar homography, with eight degrees of freedom (DOFs), is fundamental in
numerous computer vision tasks. While the positional offsets of four corners
are widely adopted (especially in neural network predictions), this
parameterization lacks geometric interpretability and typically requires
solving a linear system to compute the homography matrix. This paper presents a
novel geometric parameterization of homographies, leveraging the
similarity-kernel-similarity (SKS) decomposition for projective
transformations. Two independent sets of four geometric parameters are
decoupled: one for a similarity transformation and the other for the kernel
transformation. Additionally, the geometric interpretation linearly relating
the four kernel transformation parameters to angular offsets is derived. Our
proposed parameterization allows for direct homography estimation through
matrix multiplication, eliminating the need for solving a linear system, and
achieves performance comparable to the four-corner positional offsets in deep
homography estimation.

TLDR: MEgoHand是一个多模态框架，通过结合RGB、文本和初始手部姿势生成物理合理的手-物体交互，显著降低了手腕平移和关节旋转误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在视角不稳定、遮挡和噪声问题下的局限性，以及依赖预定义3D物体先验和文本生成模糊的问题。

Method: 采用双层架构：高层使用视觉语言模型和深度估计器推断运动先验，低层通过DiT流匹配策略生成精细轨迹。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，手腕平移误差降低86.9%，关节旋转误差降低34.1%。

Conclusion: MEgoHand能准确建模手部关节结构，并在多样场景中表现出强泛化能力。

Abstract: Egocentric hand-object motion generation is crucial for immersive AR/VR and
robotic imitation but remains challenging due to unstable viewpoints,
self-occlusions, perspective distortion, and noisy ego-motion. Existing methods
rely on predefined 3D object priors, limiting generalization to novel objects,
which restricts their generalizability to novel objects. Meanwhile, recent
multimodal approaches suffer from ambiguous generation from abstract textual
cues, intricate pipelines for modeling 3D hand-object correlation, and
compounding errors in open-loop prediction. We propose MEgoHand, a multimodal
framework that synthesizes physically plausible hand-object interactions from
egocentric RGB, text, and initial hand pose. MEgoHand introduces a bi-level
architecture: a high-level "cerebrum" leverages a vision language model (VLM)
to infer motion priors from visual-textual context and a monocular depth
estimator for object-agnostic spatial reasoning, while a low-level DiT-based
flow-matching policy generates fine-grained trajectories with temporal
orthogonal filtering to enhance stability. To address dataset inconsistency, we
design a dataset curation paradigm with an Inverse MANO Retargeting Network and
Virtual RGB-D Renderer, curating a unified dataset of 3.35M RGB-D frames, 24K
interactions, and 1.2K objects. Extensive experiments across five in-domain and
two cross-domain datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MEgoHand, achieving
substantial reductions in wrist translation error (86.9%) and joint rotation
error (34.1%), highlighting its capacity to accurately model fine-grained hand
joint structures and generalize robustly across diverse scenarios.

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上达到最优性能，证明放射学报告对答案生成的提升作用。

Conclusion: 通过结合放射学报告，显著提升了CXR VQA任务的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Chest X-ray (CXR) Visual Question Answering
(VQA), addressing both single-image image-difference questions. Single-image
questions focus on abnormalities within a specific CXR ("What abnormalities are
seen in image X?"), while image-difference questions compare two longitudinal
CXRs acquired at different time points ("What are the differences between image
X and Y?"). We further explore how the integration of radiology reports can
enhance the performance of VQA models. While previous approaches have
demonstrated the utility of radiology reports during the pre-training phase, we
extend this idea by showing that the reports can also be leveraged as
additional input to improve the VQA model's predicted answers. First, we
propose a unified method that handles both types of questions and
auto-regressively generates the answers. For single-image questions, the model
is provided with a single CXR. For image-difference questions, the model is
provided with two CXRs from the same patient, captured at different time
points, enabling the model to detect and describe temporal changes. Taking
inspiration from 'Chain-of-Thought reasoning', we demonstrate that performance
on the CXR VQA task can be improved by grounding the answer generator module
with a radiology report predicted for the same CXR. In our approach, the VQA
model is divided into two steps: i) Report Generation (RG) and ii) Answer
Generation (AG). Our results demonstrate that incorporating predicted radiology
reports as evidence to the AG model enhances performance on both single-image
and image-difference questions, achieving state-of-the-art results on the
Medical-Diff-VQA dataset.

Motivation: 当前半监督医学图像分割方法主要关注前景建模，忽视了背景建模的潜在优势。本文旨在通过背景建模提升前景分割的置信度。

Method: 提出Cross-view Bidirectional Modeling (CVBM)框架，引入背景建模作为辅助视角，并通过双向一致性机制确保前景与背景预测的对齐。

Result: 在LA、Pancreas、ACDC和HRF数据集上达到SOTA性能，Pancreas数据集上仅用20%标注数据即超越全监督方法（DSC: 84.57% vs. 83.89%）。

Conclusion: CVBM通过背景建模和双向一致性机制显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) leverages unlabeled data
to reduce reliance on manually annotated images. However, current SOTA
approaches predominantly focus on foreground-oriented modeling (i.e.,
segmenting only the foreground region) and have largely overlooked the
potential benefits of explicitly modeling the background region. Our study
theoretically and empirically demonstrates that highly certain predictions in
background modeling enhance the confidence of corresponding foreground
modeling. Building on this insight, we propose the Cross-view Bidirectional
Modeling (CVBM) framework, which introduces a novel perspective by
incorporating background modeling to improve foreground modeling performance.
Within CVBM, background modeling serves as an auxiliary perspective, providing
complementary supervisory signals to enhance the confidence of the foreground
model. Additionally, CVBM introduces an innovative bidirectional consistency
mechanism, which ensures mutual alignment between foreground predictions and
background-guided predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves SOTA performance on the LA, Pancreas, ACDC, and HRF datasets.
Notably, on the Pancreas dataset, CVBM outperforms fully supervised methods
(i.e., DSC: 84.57% vs. 83.89%) while utilizing only 20% of the labeled data.

Motivation: 现有3D-MuPPET框架依赖纹理信息，限制了其适用性。本文旨在开发一种不依赖纹理的方法，提高通用性。

Method: 基于3D-MuPPET框架，引入分割方法生成个体轮廓，估计2D关键点后三角化为3D姿态，并在后续帧中跟踪身份。

Result: 纹理无关方法精度与原框架相当，且初步验证了在其他鸟类上的适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发更鲁棒的纹理无关姿态估计框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a texture-independent approach to estimate and
track 3D joint positions of multiple pigeons. For this purpose, we build upon
the existing 3D-MuPPET framework, which estimates and tracks the 3D poses of up
to 10 pigeons using a multi-view camera setup. We extend this framework by
using a segmentation method that generates silhouettes of the individuals,
which are then used to estimate 2D keypoints. Following 3D-MuPPET, these 2D
keypoints are triangulated to infer 3D poses, and identities are matched in the
first frame and tracked in 2D across subsequent frames. Our proposed
texture-independent approach achieves comparable accuracy to the original
texture-dependent 3D-MuPPET framework. Additionally, we explore our approach's
applicability to other bird species. To do that, we infer the 2D joint
positions of four bird species without additional fine-tuning the model trained
on pigeons and obtain preliminary promising results. Thus, we think that our
approach serves as a solid foundation and inspires the development of more
robust and accurate texture-independent pose estimation frameworks.

Method: 1. 提出了VideoSafetyBench（VSB-77k）基准；2. 开发了VideoSafety-R1框架，包括Alarm Token-Guided Safety Fine-Tuning（AT-SFT）和Safety-Guided GRPO。

Result: VideoSafety-R1在VSB-Eval-HH上提升了65.1%，在其他图像安全数据集上也有显著改进。

Conclusion: 通过主动推理而非被动识别，VideoSafety-R1显著提升了视频大语言模型的安全性。

Abstract: While the safety risks of image-based large language models have been
extensively studied, their video-based counterparts (Video LLMs) remain
critically under-examined. To systematically study this problem, we introduce
\textbf{VideoSafetyBench (VSB-77k) - the first large-scale, culturally diverse
benchmark for Video LLM safety}, which compromises 77,646 video-query pairs and
spans 19 principal risk categories across 10 language communities. \textit{We
reveal that integrating video modality degrades safety performance by an
average of 42.3\%, exposing systemic risks in multimodal attack exploitation.}
To address this vulnerability, we propose \textbf{VideoSafety-R1}, a dual-stage
framework achieving unprecedented safety gains through two innovations: (1)
Alarm Token-Guided Safety Fine-Tuning (AT-SFT) injects learnable alarm tokens
into visual and textual sequences, enabling explicit harm perception across
modalities via multitask objectives. (2) Then, Safety-Guided GRPO enhances
defensive reasoning through dynamic policy optimization with rule-based rewards
derived from dual-modality verification. These components synergize to shift
safety alignment from passive harm recognition to active reasoning. The
resulting framework achieves a 65.1\% improvement on VSB-Eval-HH, and improves
by 59.1\%, 44.3\%, and 15.0\% on the image safety datasets MMBench, VLGuard,
and FigStep, respectively. \textit{Our codes are available in the supplementary
materials.} \textcolor{red}{Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful

Method: 使用MedMultiPoints数据集，将任务转化为指令提示，并通过LoRA方法微调Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过提示驱动的微调，通用VLM可以适应专业医学任务，生成可解释的结构化输出，为可解释和多功能医学AI提供了可能。

Abstract: We investigate fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-task
medical image understanding, focusing on detection, localization, and counting
of findings in medical images. Our objective is to evaluate whether
instruction-tuned VLMs can simultaneously improve these tasks, with the goal of
enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Using MedMultiPoints, a
multimodal dataset with annotations from endoscopy (polyps and instruments) and
microscopy (sperm cells), we reformulate each task into instruction-based
prompts suitable for vision-language reasoning. We fine-tune
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) across multiple task
combinations. Results show that multi-task training improves robustness and
accuracy. For example, it reduces the Count Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and
increases Matching Accuracy in the Counting + Pointing task. However,
trade-offs emerge, such as more zero-case point predictions, indicating reduced
reliability in edge cases despite overall performance gains. Our study
highlights the potential of adapting general-purpose VLMs to specialized
medical tasks via prompt-driven fine-tuning. This approach mirrors clinical
workflows, where radiologists simultaneously localize, count, and describe
findings - demonstrating how VLMs can learn composite diagnostic reasoning
patterns. The model produces interpretable, structured outputs, offering a
promising step toward explainable and versatile medical AI. Code, model
weights, and scripts will be released for reproducibility at

Abstract: Due to the recent increase in the number of connected devices, the need to
promptly detect security issues is emerging. Moreover, the high number of
communication flows creates the necessity of processing huge amounts of data.
Furthermore, the connected devices are heterogeneous in nature, having
different computational capacities. For this reason, in this work we propose an
image-based representation of network traffic which allows to realize a compact
summary of the current network conditions with 1-second time windows. The
proposed representation highlights the presence of anomalies thus reducing the
need for complex processing architectures. Finally, we present an unsupervised
learning approach which effectively detects the presence of anomalies. The code

Conclusion: FarSight是一种通用的即插即用解码策略，通过优化因果掩码有效减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved performance in visual question answering. However, they
often suffer from hallucinations. In this work, hallucinations are categorized
into two main types: initial hallucinations and snowball hallucinations. We
argue that adequate contextual information can be extracted directly from the
token interaction process. Inspired by causal inference in the decoding
strategy, we propose to leverage causal masks to establish information
propagation between multimodal tokens. The hypothesis is that insufficient
interaction between those tokens may lead the model to rely on outlier tokens,
overlooking dense and rich contextual cues. Therefore, we propose to intervene
in the propagation process by tackling outlier tokens to enhance in-context
inference. With this goal, we present FarSight, a versatile plug-and-play
decoding strategy to reduce attention interference from outlier tokens merely
by optimizing the causal mask. The heart of our method is effective token
propagation. We design an attention register structure within the upper
triangular matrix of the causal mask, dynamically allocating attention to
capture attention diverted to outlier tokens. Moreover, a positional awareness
encoding method with a diminishing masking rate is proposed, allowing the model
to attend to further preceding tokens, especially for video sequence tasks.
With extensive experiments, FarSight demonstrates significant
hallucination-mitigating performance across different MLLMs on both image and
video benchmarks, proving its effectiveness.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种新的高光谱锐化方法，通过自适应权重神经网络解决现有方法在光谱保真度上的不足，确保所有波段的一致质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱锐化面临独特挑战，如波段数量多、噪声大、光谱不匹配等，现有方法难以保证所有波段的一致质量。

Method: 使用轻量级神经网络，动态调整权重以适应每个波段，并通过动态调整空间损失实现快速收敛。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在所有波段上均能提供一致的高质量锐化效果，性能与现有最优方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部数据训练，灵活且低复杂度，为高光谱锐化提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral pansharpening has received much attention in recent years due
to technological and methodological advances that open the door to new
application scenarios. However, research on this topic is only now gaining
momentum. The most popular methods are still borrowed from the more mature
field of multispectral pansharpening and often overlook the unique challenges
posed by hyperspectral data fusion, such as i) the very large number of bands,
ii) the overwhelming noise in selected spectral ranges, iii) the significant
spectral mismatch between panchromatic and hyperspectral components, iv) a
typically high resolution ratio. Imprecise data modeling especially affects
spectral fidelity. Even state-of-the-art methods perform well in certain
spectral ranges and much worse in others, failing to ensure consistent quality
across all bands, with the risk of generating unreliable results. Here, we
propose a hyperspectral pansharpening method that explicitly addresses this
problem and ensures uniform spectral quality. To this end, a single lightweight
neural network is used, with weights that adapt on the fly to each band. During
fine-tuning, the spatial loss is turned on and off to ensure a fast convergence
of the spectral loss to the desired level, according to a hysteresis-like
dynamic. Furthermore, the spatial loss itself is appropriately redefined to
account for nonlinear dependencies between panchromatic and spectral bands.
Overall, the proposed method is fully unsupervised, with no prior training on
external data, flexible, and low-complexity. Experiments on a recently
published benchmarking toolbox show that it ensures excellent sharpening
quality, competitive with the state-of-the-art, consistently across all bands.

Motivation: 医学异常检测面临数据隐私和稀缺问题，现有方法多忽略多异常类别区分。

Result: 实验证明方法在多异常检测中有效。

Conclusion: SD-MAD框架解决了少样本医学异常检测中的多类别识别问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is crucial for early clinical intervention,
yet it faces challenges due to limited access to high-quality medical imaging
data, caused by privacy concerns and data silos. Few-shot learning has emerged
as a promising approach to alleviate these limitations by leveraging the
large-scale prior knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs). Recent
advancements in few-shot medical AD have treated normal and abnormal cases as a
one-class classification problem, often overlooking the distinction among
multiple anomaly categories. Thus, in this paper, we propose a framework
tailored for few-shot medical anomaly detection in the scenario where the
identification of multiple anomaly categories is required. To capture the
detailed radiological signs of medical anomaly categories, our framework
incorporates diverse textual descriptions for each category generated by a
Large-Language model, under the assumption that different anomalies in medical
images may share common radiological signs in each category. Specifically, we
introduce SD-MAD, a two-stage Sign-Driven few-shot Multi-Anomaly Detection
framework: (i) Radiological signs are aligned with anomaly categories by
amplifying inter-anomaly discrepancy; (ii) Aligned signs are selected further
to mitigate the effect of the under-fitting and uncertain-sample issue caused
by limited medical data, employing an automatic sign selection strategy at
inference. Moreover, we propose three protocols to comprehensively quantify the
performance of multi-anomaly detection. Extensive experiments illustrate the
effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在融合2D图像、3D点云和文本指令时面临多模态数据稀缺和模态间冲突的挑战，需要一种有效的方法来整合不同模态的信息。

Method: 提出CoNav框架，通过跨模态信念对齐（Cross-Modal Belief Alignment）共享3D-text模型的结构化空间语义知识，轻量级微调导航代理以整合视觉和空间语义信息。

Result: 在四个导航基准（R2R、CVDN、REVERIE、SOON）和两个空间推理基准（ScanQA、SQA3D）上表现显著提升，且路径更短（SPL指标）。

Conclusion: CoNav展示了融合多模态数据在导航中的潜力，同时揭示了其挑战，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Embodied navigation demands comprehensive scene understanding and precise
spatial reasoning. While image-text models excel at interpreting pixel-level
color and lighting cues, 3D-text models capture volumetric structure and
spatial relationships. However, unified fusion approaches that jointly fuse 2D
images, 3D point clouds, and textual instructions face challenges in limited
availability of triple-modality data and difficulty resolving conflicting
beliefs among modalities. In this work, we introduce CoNav, a collaborative
cross-modal reasoning framework where a pretrained 3D-text model explicitly
guides an image-text navigation agent by providing structured spatial-semantic
knowledge to resolve ambiguities during navigation. Specifically, we introduce
Cross-Modal Belief Alignment, which operationalizes this cross-modal guidance
by simply sharing textual hypotheses from the 3D-text model to the navigation
agent. Through lightweight fine-tuning on a small 2D-3D-text corpus, the
navigation agent learns to integrate visual cues with spatial-semantic
knowledge derived from the 3D-text model, enabling effective reasoning in
embodied navigation. CoNav achieves significant improvements on four standard
embodied navigation benchmarks (R2R, CVDN, REVERIE, SOON) and two spatial
reasoning benchmarks (ScanQA, SQA3D). Moreover, under close navigation Success
Rate, CoNav often generates shorter paths compared to other methods (as
measured by SPL), showcasing the potential and challenges of fusing data from
different modalities in embodied navigation. Project Page:

Abstract: In this work, we aim to incentivize the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) and develop an
effective approach that mitigates the sparse reward and advantage vanishing
issues during RL. To this end, we propose Share-GRPO, a novel RL approach that
tackle these issues by exploring and sharing diverse reasoning trajectories
over expanded question space. Specifically, Share-GRPO first expands the
question space for a given question via data transformation techniques, and
then encourages MLLM to effectively explore diverse reasoning trajectories over
the expanded question space and shares the discovered reasoning trajectories
across the expanded questions during RL. In addition, Share-GRPO also shares
reward information during advantage computation, which estimates solution
advantages hierarchically across and within question variants, allowing more
accurate estimation of relative advantages and improving the stability of
policy training. Extensive evaluations over six widely-used reasoning
benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method. Code will be
available at https://github.com/HJYao00/R1-ShareVL.

Conclusion: VQA零样本学习在电池异常检测中具有潜力，未来可进一步优化其效果。

Abstract: Batteries are essential for various applications, including electric vehicles
and renewable energy storage, making safety and efficiency critical concerns.
Anomaly detection in battery thermal images helps identify failures early, but
traditional deep learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is
difficult to obtain, especially for anomalies due to safety risks and high data
collection costs. To overcome this, we explore zero-shot anomaly detection
using Visual Question Answering (VQA) models, which leverage pretrained
knowledge and textbased prompts to generalize across vision tasks. By
incorporating prior knowledge of normal battery thermal behavior, we design
prompts to detect anomalies without battery-specific training data. We evaluate
three VQA models (ChatGPT-4o, LLaVa-13b, and BLIP-2) analyzing their robustness
to prompt variations, repeated trials, and qualitative outputs. Despite the
lack of finetuning on battery data, our approach demonstrates competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art models that are trained with the
battery data. Our findings highlight the potential of VQA-based zero-shot
learning for battery anomaly detection and suggest future directions for
improving its effectiveness.

Motivation: 传统3D对象压缩方法在高压缩率下表现不佳，而语义压缩通过直接处理核心概念，解决了这一问题。

Method: 构建了一个基于公开生成模型的3D语义压缩流程，利用深度生成模型预测缺失信息。

Result: 在Objaverse数据集上实现了高达105x的压缩率，并在100x压缩率附近优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 语义压缩在高压缩率下表现优异，适合大规模协作项目，尤其是在增强和虚拟现实应用中。

Abstract: Traditional methods for 3D object compression operate only on structural
information within the object vertices, polygons, and textures. These methods
are effective at compression rates up to 10x for standard object sizes but
quickly deteriorate at higher compression rates with texture artifacts,
low-polygon counts, and mesh gaps. In contrast, semantic compression ignores
structural information and operates directly on the core concepts to push to
extreme levels of compression. In addition, it uses natural language as its
storage format, which makes it natively human-readable and a natural fit for
emerging applications built around large-scale, collaborative projects within
augmented and virtual reality. It deprioritizes structural information like
location, size, and orientation and predicts the missing information with
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In this work, we construct a pipeline
for 3D semantic compression from public generative models and explore the
quality-compression frontier for 3D object compression. We apply this pipeline
to achieve rates as high as 105x for 3D objects taken from the Objaverse
dataset and show that semantic compression can outperform traditional methods
in the important quality-preserving region around 100x compression.

Abstract: The Earth's surface is subject to complex and dynamic processes, ranging from
large-scale phenomena such as tectonic plate movements to localized changes
associated with ecosystems, agriculture, or human activity. Satellite images
enable global monitoring of these processes with extensive spatial and temporal
coverage, offering advantages over in-situ methods. In particular, resulting
satellite image time series (SITS) datasets contain valuable information. To
handle their large volume and complexity, some recent works focus on the use of
graph-based techniques that abandon the regular Euclidean structure of
satellite data to work at an object level. Besides, graphs enable modelling
spatial and temporal interactions between identified objects, which are crucial
for pattern detection, classification and regression tasks. This paper is an
effort to examine the integration of graph-based methods in spatio-temporal
remote-sensing analysis. In particular, it aims to present a versatile
graph-based pipeline to tackle SITS analysis. It focuses on the construction of
spatio-temporal graphs from SITS and their application to downstream tasks. The
paper includes a comprehensive review and two case studies, which highlight the
potential of graph-based approaches for land cover mapping and water resource
forecasting. It also discusses numerous perspectives to resolve current
limitations and encourage future developments.

Conclusion: 一步扩散生成在压缩任务中可行且高效，OneDC为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: While recent diffusion-based generative image codecs have shown impressive
performance, their iterative sampling process introduces unpleasing latency. In
this work, we revisit the design of a diffusion-based codec and argue that
multi-step sampling is not necessary for generative compression. Based on this
insight, we propose OneDC, a One-step Diffusion-based generative image Codec --
that integrates a latent compression module with a one-step diffusion
generator. Recognizing the critical role of semantic guidance in one-step
diffusion, we propose using the hyperprior as a semantic signal, overcoming the
limitations of text prompts in representing complex visual content. To further
enhance the semantic capability of the hyperprior, we introduce a semantic
distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge from a pretrained generative
tokenizer to the hyperprior codec. Additionally, we adopt a hybrid pixel- and
latent-domain optimization to jointly enhance both reconstruction fidelity and
perceptual realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneDC achieves SOTA
perceptual quality even with one-step generation, offering over 40% bitrate
reduction and 20x faster decoding compared to prior multi-step diffusion-based
codecs. Code will be released later.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal generative models have enabled significant
progress in instruction-based image editing. However, while these models
produce visually plausible outputs, their capacity for knowledge-based
reasoning editing tasks remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce
KRIS-Bench (Knowledge-based Reasoning in Image-editing Systems Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark designed to assess models through a cognitively informed
lens. Drawing from educational theory, KRIS-Bench categorizes editing tasks
across three foundational knowledge types: Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural.
Based on this taxonomy, we design 22 representative tasks spanning 7 reasoning
dimensions and release 1,267 high-quality annotated editing instances. To
support fine-grained evaluation, we propose a comprehensive protocol that
incorporates a novel Knowledge Plausibility metric, enhanced by knowledge hints

models reveal significant gaps in reasoning performance, highlighting the need
for knowledge-centric benchmarks to advance the development of intelligent

Motivation: 现有方法将几何和属性编码分开处理，增加了计算复杂度且未充分利用共享特征。

Result: 相比基于规则和学习的方法，SEDD-PCC表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: SEDD-PCC是一种高效且实用的点云压缩解决方案。

Abstract: To encode point clouds containing both geometry and attributes, most
learning-based compression schemes treat geometry and attribute coding
separately, employing distinct encoders and decoders. This not only increases
computational complexity but also fails to fully exploit shared features
between geometry and attributes. To address this limitation, we propose
SEDD-PCC, an end-to-end learning-based framework for lossy point cloud
compression that jointly compresses geometry and attributes. SEDD-PCC employs a
single encoder to extract shared geometric and attribute features into a
unified latent space, followed by dual specialized decoders that sequentially
reconstruct geometry and attributes. Additionally, we incorporate knowledge
distillation to enhance feature representation learning from a teacher model,
further improving coding efficiency. With its simple yet effective design,
SEDD-PCC provides an efficient and practical solution for point cloud
compression. Comparative evaluations against both rule-based and learning-based
methods demonstrate its competitive performance, highlighting SEDD-PCC as a
promising AI-driven compression approach.

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种表示差异桥接（RDB）方法，通过跨模态不对称适配器（CMAA）和双任务一致性损失（DTCL）解决遥感图像-文本检索中的模态不平衡问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调（PEFT）方法在视觉与语言预训练（VLP）模型中采用对称适配器结构，但文本模态的强判别性可能主导优化过程，抑制图像表示学习，导致跨模态优化不平衡。

Method: 提出RDB方法，包括跨模态不对称适配器（CMAA）和双任务一致性损失（DTCL）。CMAA通过视觉增强适配器（VEA）和文本语义适配器（TSA）分别优化图像和文本特征；DTCL通过自适应加权组合提升跨模态对齐鲁棒性。

Result: 在RSICD和RSITMD数据集上，RDB方法在mR指标上比现有PEFT方法提升6%-11%，比全微调GeoRSCLIP模型提升1.15%-2%。

Conclusion: RDB方法有效解决了跨模态优化不平衡问题，显著提升了遥感图像-文本检索的性能。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval (RSITR) plays a critical role in
geographic information interpretation, disaster monitoring, and urban planning
by establishing semantic associations between image and textual descriptions.
Existing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods for Vision-and-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models typically adopt symmetric adapter structures for
exploring cross-modal correlations. However, the strong discriminative nature
of text modality may dominate the optimization process and inhibits image
representation learning. The nonnegligible imbalanced cross-modal optimization
remains a bottleneck to enhancing the model performance. To address this issue,
this study proposes a Representation Discrepancy Bridging (RDB) method for the
RSITR task. On the one hand, a Cross-Modal Asymmetric Adapter (CMAA) is
designed to enable modality-specific optimization and improve feature
alignment. The CMAA comprises a Visual Enhancement Adapter (VEA) and a Text
Semantic Adapter (TSA). VEA mines fine-grained image features by Differential
Attention (DA) mechanism, while TSA identifies key textual semantics through
Hierarchical Attention (HA) mechanism. On the other hand, this study extends
the traditional single-task retrieval framework to a dual-task optimization
framework and develops a Dual-Task Consistency Loss (DTCL). The DTCL improves
cross-modal alignment robustness through an adaptive weighted combination of
cross-modal, classification, and exponential moving average consistency
constraints. Experiments on RSICD and RSITMD datasets show that the proposed
RDB method achieves a 6%-11% improvement in mR metrics compared to
state-of-the-art PEFT methods and a 1.15%-2% improvement over the full
fine-tuned GeoRSCLIP model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练模型存在数据偏差和低质量生成问题，全局强化学习方法难以捕捉局部结构细节。

Method: 采用Masked Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO)进行局部优化，结合边界边缘比（BER）和拓扑得分（TS）评估质量。

Result: 实验显示Mesh-RFT显著降低Hausdorff距离（24.6%）并提升拓扑得分（3.8%），优于全局方法。

Conclusion: Mesh-RFT通过细粒度优化实现了生产级网格生成的最高性能。

Abstract: Existing pretrained models for 3D mesh generation often suffer from data
biases and produce low-quality results, while global reinforcement learning
(RL) methods rely on object-level rewards that struggle to capture local
structure details. To address these challenges, we present \textbf{Mesh-RFT}, a
novel fine-grained reinforcement fine-tuning framework that employs Masked
Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable localized refinement via
quality-aware face masking. To facilitate efficient quality evaluation, we
introduce an objective topology-aware scoring system to evaluate geometric
integrity and topological regularity at both object and face levels through two
metrics: Boundary Edge Ratio (BER) and Topology Score (TS). By integrating
these metrics into a fine-grained RL strategy, Mesh-RFT becomes the first
method to optimize mesh quality at the granularity of individual faces,
resolving localized errors while preserving global coherence. Experiment
results show that our M-DPO approach reduces Hausdorff Distance (HD) by 24.6\%
and improves Topology Score (TS) by 3.8\% over pre-trained models, while
outperforming global DPO methods with a 17.4\% HD reduction and 4.9\% TS gain.
These results demonstrate Mesh-RFT's ability to improve geometric integrity and
topological regularity, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in
production-ready mesh generation. Project Page:

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了提示优化的性能，减少了对外部数据和模型的依赖。

Abstract: Text-to-image models are powerful for producing high-quality images based on
given text prompts, but crafting these prompts often requires specialized
vocabulary. To address this, existing methods train rewriting models with
supervision from large amounts of manually annotated data and trained aesthetic
assessment models. To alleviate the dependence on data scale for model training
and the biases introduced by trained models, we propose a novel prompt
optimization framework, designed to rephrase a simple user prompt into a
sophisticated prompt to a text-to-image model. Specifically, we employ the
large vision language models (LVLMs) as the solver to rewrite the user prompt,
and concurrently, employ LVLMs as a reward model to score the aesthetics and
alignment of the images generated by the optimized prompt. Instead of laborious
human feedback, we exploit the prior knowledge of the LVLM to provide rewards,
i.e., AI feedback. Simultaneously, the solver and the reward model are unified
into one model and iterated in reinforcement learning to achieve
self-improvement by giving a solution and judging itself. Results on two
popular datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other strong
competitors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注多模态输入和纯文本推理，而忽略了多模态输出推理的重要性，因此需要一个新的评估工具。

Method: 通过精心挑选803个涵盖数学、物理、计数和游戏的问题，构建RBench-V基准，要求模型进行图像生成和辅助线构建等视觉推理任务。

Result: 评估结果显示，即使是表现最好的模型o3，准确率仅为25.8%，远低于人类的82.3%。

Conclusion: 当前模型在多模态输出推理能力上仍有显著不足，RBench-V为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of native multi-modal models and omni-models,
exemplified by GPT-4o, Gemini, and o3, with their capability to process and
generate content across modalities such as text and images, marks a significant
milestone in the evolution of intelligence. Systematic evaluation of their
multi-modal output capabilities in visual thinking processes (also known as
multi-modal chain of thought, M-CoT) becomes critically important. However,
existing benchmarks for evaluating multi-modal models primarily focus on
assessing multi-modal inputs and text-only reasoning while neglecting the
importance of reasoning through multi-modal outputs. In this paper, we present
a benchmark, dubbed RBench-V, designed to assess models' vision-indispensable
reasoning abilities. To construct RBench-V, we carefully hand-pick 803
questions covering math, physics, counting, and games. Unlike previous
benchmarks that typically specify certain input modalities, RBench-V presents
problems centered on multi-modal outputs, which require image manipulation such
as generating novel images and constructing auxiliary lines to support the
reasoning process. We evaluate numerous open- and closed-source models on
RBench-V, including o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, etc. Even the
best-performing model, o3, achieves only 25.8% accuracy on RBench-V, far below
the human score of 82.3%, highlighting that current models struggle to leverage
multi-modal reasoning. Data and code are available at

TLDR: 本文提出了一种无监督学习框架，用于提取皮肤病学特征，替代传统的ImageNet预训练方法。结果表明，自监督学习在泛化能力和适应性上优于ImageNet预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据和计算资源，而基于ImageNet的预训练模型可能无法捕捉医学影像的领域特性。

Method: 使用变分自编码器（VAE）在皮肤病学数据集上进行无监督训练，构建临床相关的潜在空间，并与ImageNet预训练模型进行对比。

Result: 自监督模型的验证损失降低33.33%，准确率提升44.44%，且过拟合现象较少；ImageNet预训练模型虽收敛快，但过拟合严重。

Conclusion: 领域特定的特征提取在医学影像中至关重要，自监督学习表现出更强的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision but relies heavily on large
labeled datasets and computational resources. Transfer learning, particularly
fine-tuning pretrained models, offers a practical alternative; however, models
pretrained on natural image datasets such as ImageNet may fail to capture
domain-specific characteristics in medical imaging. This study introduces an
unsupervised learning framework that extracts high-value dermatological
features instead of relying solely on ImageNet-based pretraining. We employ a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained from scratch on a proprietary
dermatological dataset, allowing the model to learn a structured and clinically
relevant latent space. This self-supervised feature extractor is then compared
to an ImageNet-pretrained backbone under identical classification conditions,
highlighting the trade-offs between general-purpose and domain-specific
pretraining. Our results reveal distinct learning patterns. The self-supervised
model achieves a final validation loss of 0.110 (-33.33%), while the
ImageNet-pretrained model stagnates at 0.100 (-16.67%), indicating overfitting.
Accuracy trends confirm this: the self-supervised model improves from 45% to
65% (+44.44%) with a near-zero overfitting gap, whereas the ImageNet-pretrained
model reaches 87% (+50.00%) but plateaus at 75% (+19.05%), with its overfitting
gap increasing to +0.060. These findings suggest that while ImageNet
pretraining accelerates convergence, it also amplifies overfitting on
non-clinically relevant features. In contrast, self-supervised learning
achieves steady improvements, stronger generalization, and superior
adaptability, underscoring the importance of domain-specific feature extraction
in medical imaging.

Motivation: 现有少样本计数方法在领域偏移下泛化能力不足，尤其是单领域泛化问题尚未被探索。

Method: 提出URM模型，利用大规模预训练视觉语言模型的通用表示来构建相关性图，以学习高度泛化的原型。

Result: URM在领域内和新引入的领域泛化设置中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: URM通过结合通用视觉语言表示，显著提升了少样本计数模型对领域偏移的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Few-shot counting estimates the number of target objects in an image using
only a few annotated exemplars. However, domain shift severely hinders existing
methods to generalize to unseen scenarios. This falls into the realm of single
domain generalization that remains unexplored in few-shot counting. To solve
this problem, we begin by analyzing the main limitations of current methods,
which typically follow a standard pipeline that extract the object prototypes
from exemplars and then match them with image feature to construct the
correlation map. We argue that existing methods overlook the significance of
learning highly generalized prototypes. Building on this insight, we propose
the first single domain generalization few-shot counting model, Universal
Representation Matching, termed URM. Our primary contribution is the discovery
that incorporating universal vision-language representations distilled from a
large scale pretrained vision-language model into the correlation construction
process substantially improves robustness to domain shifts without compromising
in domain performance. As a result, URM achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both in domain and the newly introduced domain generalization setting.

paradigms are systematically explored and evaluated to effectively guide the
attention of large models, fully unleashing their powerful generalization and
adaptability abilities. Experimental results demonstrate that, with our
carefully designed approach, directly utilizing an individual multimodal model
already outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method which includes
several additional processes. Besides, an additional stage is further
introduced that facilitates the cooperation and ensemble of periodic results,
which achieves impressive performance improvements. We hope this work serves as
a valuable reference for the practical application of large models and inspires
future research in the field.

TLDR: HASTE是一种两阶段训练方法，通过阶段性终止对齐损失，显著加速DiTs训练，同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DiTs训练速度慢的问题，尤其是REPA方法在后期性能下降的局限性。

Method: 提出HASTE，分两阶段：第一阶段通过全面对齐损失快速收敛；第二阶段终止对齐损失，释放DiTs生成能力。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，HASTE仅用50轮达到基线性能，500轮匹配REPA最佳性能，优化步骤减少28倍。

Conclusion: HASTE是一种简单而有效的扩散训练方法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art image quality, yet
their training remains notoriously slow. A recent remedy -- representation
alignment (REPA) that matches DiT hidden features to those of a non-generative
teacher (e.g. DINO) -- dramatically accelerates the early epochs but plateaus
or even degrades performance later. We trace this failure to a capacity
mismatch: once the generative student begins modelling the joint data
distribution, the teacher's lower-dimensional embeddings and attention patterns
become a straitjacket rather than a guide. We then introduce HASTE (Holistic
Alignment with Stage-wise Termination for Efficient training), a two-phase
schedule that keeps the help and drops the hindrance. Phase I applies a
holistic alignment loss that simultaneously distills attention maps (relational
priors) and feature projections (semantic anchors) from the teacher into
mid-level layers of the DiT, yielding rapid convergence. Phase II then performs
one-shot termination that deactivates the alignment loss, once a simple trigger
such as a fixed iteration is hit, freeing the DiT to focus on denoising and
exploit its generative capacity. HASTE speeds up training of diverse DiTs
without architecture changes. On ImageNet 256X256, it reaches the vanilla
SiT-XL/2 baseline FID in 50 epochs and matches REPA's best FID in 500 epochs,
amounting to a 28X reduction in optimization steps. HASTE also improves
text-to-image DiTs on MS-COCO, demonstrating to be a simple yet principled
recipe for efficient diffusion training across various tasks. Our code is
available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/HASTE .

Abstract: Earth observation foundation models have shown strong generalization across
multiple Earth observation tasks, but their robustness under real-world
perturbations remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce REOBench,
the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of Earth
observation foundation models across six tasks and twelve types of image
corruptions, including both appearance-based and geometric perturbations. To
ensure realistic and fine-grained evaluation, our benchmark focuses on
high-resolution optical remote sensing images, which are widely used in
critical applications such as urban planning and disaster response. We conduct
a systematic evaluation of a broad range of models trained using masked image
modeling, contrastive learning, and vision-language pre-training paradigms. Our
results reveal that (1) existing Earth observation foundation models experience
significant performance degradation when exposed to input corruptions. (2) The
severity of degradation varies across tasks, model architectures, backbone
sizes, and types of corruption, with performance drop varying from less than 1%
to over 20%. (3) Vision-language models show enhanced robustness, particularly
in multimodal tasks. REOBench underscores the vulnerability of current Earth
observation foundation models to real-world corruptions and provides actionable
insights for developing more robust and reliable models.

Method: 采用V2V方法，绕过事件流生成，直接转换视频帧为事件体素网格，支持参数随机化。

Result: 存储需求减少150倍，训练了10,000个视频（52小时），模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: V2V方法高效且可扩展，为事件视觉模型的大规模训练提供了新途径。

Abstract: Event-based cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution,
high dynamic range, and low power consumption. However, the massive storage
requirements and I/O burdens of existing synthetic data generation pipelines
and the scarcity of real data prevent event-based training datasets from
scaling up, limiting the development and generalization capabilities of event
vision models. To address this challenge, we introduce Video-to-Voxel (V2V), an
approach that directly converts conventional video frames into event-based
voxel grid representations, bypassing the storage-intensive event stream
generation entirely. V2V enables a 150 times reduction in storage requirements
while supporting on-the-fly parameter randomization for enhanced model
robustness. Leveraging this efficiency, we train several video reconstruction
and optical flow estimation model architectures on 10,000 diverse videos
totaling 52 hours--an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets,
yielding substantial improvements.

Abstract: The integration of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) into autonomous driving
systems has shown promise in addressing key challenges such as learning
complexity, interpretability, and common-sense reasoning. However, existing
approaches often struggle with efficient integration and realtime
decision-making due to computational demands. In this paper, we introduce
SOLVE, an innovative framework that synergizes VLMs with end-to-end (E2E)
models to enhance autonomous vehicle planning. Our approach emphasizes
knowledge sharing at the feature level through a shared visual encoder,
enabling comprehensive interaction between VLM and E2E components. We propose a
Trajectory Chain-of-Thought (T-CoT) paradigm, which progressively refines
trajectory predictions, reducing uncertainty and improving accuracy. By
employing a temporal decoupling strategy, SOLVE achieves efficient cooperation
by aligning high-quality VLM outputs with E2E real-time performance. Evaluated
on the nuScenes dataset, our method demonstrates significant improvements in
trajectory prediction accuracy, paving the way for more robust and reliable
autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Existing methods for multimodal MRI segmentation with missing modalities
typically assume that all MRI modalities are available during training.
However, in clinical practice, some modalities may be missing due to the
sequential nature of MRI acquisition, leading to performance degradation.
Furthermore, retraining models to accommodate newly available modalities can be
inefficient and may cause overfitting, potentially compromising previously
learned knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Replay-based
Hypergraph Domain Incremental Learning (ReHyDIL) for brain tumor segmentation
with missing modalities. ReHyDIL leverages Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) to
enable the segmentation model to learn from newly acquired MRI modalities
without forgetting previously learned information. To enhance segmentation
performance across diverse patient scenarios, we introduce the Cross-Patient
Hypergraph Segmentation Network (CHSNet), which utilizes hypergraphs to capture
high-order associations between patients. Additionally, we incorporate
Tversky-Aware Contrastive (TAC) loss to effectively mitigate information
imbalance both across and within different modalities. Extensive experiments on
the BraTS2019 dataset demonstrate that ReHyDIL outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving an improvement of over 2\% in the Dice Similarity
Coefficient across various tumor regions. Our code is available at ReHyDIL.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in video restoration under rainy
conditions over the past decade, largely propelled by advancements in deep
learning. Nevertheless, existing methods that depend on paired data struggle to
generalize effectively to real-world scenarios, primarily due to the disparity
between synthetic and authentic rain effects. To address these limitations, we
propose a dual-branch spatio-temporal state-space model to enhance rain streak
removal in video sequences. Specifically, we design spatial and temporal
state-space model layers to extract spatial features and incorporate temporal
dependencies across frames, respectively. To improve multi-frame feature
fusion, we derive a dynamic stacking filter, which adaptively approximates
statistical filters for superior pixel-wise feature refinement. Moreover, we
develop a median stacking loss to enable semi-supervised learning by generating
pseudo-clean patches based on the sparsity prior of rain. To further explore
the capacity of deraining models in supporting other vision-based tasks in
rainy environments, we introduce a novel real-world benchmark focused on object
detection and tracking in rainy conditions. Our method is extensively evaluated
across multiple benchmarks containing numerous synthetic and real-world rainy
videos, consistently demonstrating its superiority in quantitative metrics,
visual quality, efficiency, and its utility for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Embodied AI has developed rapidly in recent years, but it is still mainly
deployed in laboratories, with various distortions in the Real-world limiting
its application. Traditionally, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are
applied to predict human preferences for distorted images; however, there is no
IQA method to assess the usability of an image in embodied tasks, namely, the
perceptual quality for robots. To provide accurate and reliable quality
indicators for future embodied scenarios, we first propose the topic: IQA for
Embodied AI. Specifically, we (1) based on the Mertonian system and
meta-cognitive theory, constructed a perception-cognition-decision-execution
pipeline and defined a comprehensive subjective score collection process; (2)
established the Embodied-IQA database, containing over 36k reference/distorted
image pairs, with more than 5m fine-grained annotations provided by Vision
Language Models/Vision Language Action-models/Real-world robots; (3) trained
and validated the performance of mainstream IQA methods on Embodied-IQA,
demonstrating the need to develop more accurate quality indicators for Embodied
AI. We sincerely hope that through evaluation, we can promote the application
of Embodied AI under complex distortions in the Real-world. Project page:

### [252] [Action2Dialogue: Generating Character-Centric Narratives from Scene-Level Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16819)
*Taewon Kang,Ming C. Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种模块化流程，将动作级提示转化为视觉和听觉基础叙事对话，丰富视觉叙事。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成系统在角色对话和语音方面研究不足，需填补这一空白。

Method: 结合视觉语言编码器提取语义特征，引导大语言模型生成自然对话，并通过递归叙事银行确保上下文一致性。

Result: 生成角色一致、自然对话的语音视频叙事，适用于多种故事场景。

Conclusion: 无需额外训练，框架可广泛应用于不同故事类型，提升叙事体验。

Abstract: Recent advances in scene-based video generation have enabled systems to
synthesize coherent visual narratives from structured prompts. However, a
crucial dimension of storytelling -- character-driven dialogue and speech --
remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a modular pipeline that
transforms action-level prompts into visually and auditorily grounded narrative
dialogue, enriching visual storytelling with natural voice and character
expression. Our method takes as input a pair of prompts per scene, where the
first defines the setting and the second specifies a character's behavior.
While a story generation model such as Text2Story generates the corresponding
visual scene, we focus on generating expressive character utterances from these
prompts and the scene image. We apply a pretrained vision-language encoder to
extract a high-level semantic feature from the representative frame, capturing
salient visual context. This feature is then combined with the structured
prompts and used to guide a large language model in synthesizing natural,
character-consistent dialogue. To ensure contextual consistency across scenes,
we introduce a Recursive Narrative Bank that conditions each dialogue
generation on the accumulated dialogue history from prior scenes. This approach
enables characters to speak in ways that reflect their evolving goals and
interactions throughout a story. Finally, we render each utterance as
expressive, character-consistent speech, resulting in fully-voiced video
narratives. Our framework requires no additional training and demonstrates
applicability across a variety of story settings, from fantasy adventures to
slice-of-life episodes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上多模态虚假信息的快速传播引发关注，但现有研究因缺乏大规模多样化数据集而受限，且方法易过拟合。

Method: 提出FakeVV数据集和Fact-R1框架，结合深度推理与协作式规则强化学习，通过三阶段训练实现。

Result: Fact-R1在多模态虚假信息检测中展现出与高级文本强化学习系统相当的推理能力。

Conclusion: 研究为虚假信息检测建立了新范式，结合大规模视频理解、推理引导对齐和可解释验证。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media has raised
growing concerns, while research on video misinformation detection remains
limited due to the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets. Existing methods
often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive
content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale
benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained,
interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel
framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based
reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1)
misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference
alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This
enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those
observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more
complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm
for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding,
reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: LaViDa是一种基于离散扩散模型（DMs）的视觉语言模型（VLM），通过并行解码和双向上下文实现快速推理和可控生成，性能优于现有自回归模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视觉语言模型（如LLaVA）在推理速度和可控生成方面表现不佳，离散扩散模型在语言任务中表现优异，但在多模态任务中潜力未被充分探索。

Method: LaViDa通过为DMs配备视觉编码器并联合微调，引入互补掩码、前缀KV缓存和时间步偏移等技术，优化训练和推理。

Result: LaViDa在多模态基准测试（如MMMU）中表现优异，COCO字幕任务中CIDEr得分提升4.1，推理速度提升1.92倍；双向任务中诗歌完成提升59%。

Conclusion: LaViDa展示了离散扩散模型在多模态任务中的潜力，是自回归模型的强有力替代方案。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve a wide range of tasks
requiring visual reasoning. In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for
VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining
outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR)
VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs)
offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference
and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling.
While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks
is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build
LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the
combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges
encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking
for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep
shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves
competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such
as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible
speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO
captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x
speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained
Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR
VLMs. Code and models will be released in the camera-ready version.

Motivation: 现有方法基于扩散模型，不适用于ERP全景图（违反i.i.d.假设），且将文本生成和图像生成视为独立任务。

Method: 提出PAR框架，利用掩码自回归建模避免i.i.d.假设，统一文本和图像条件生成，并引入循环填充和一致性对齐策略。

Result: 实验表明PAR在文本到图像生成和全景图外绘任务中表现优异，具有良好扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PAR为全景图像生成提供了一种高效统一的解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress in panoramic image generation has underscored two critical
limitations in existing approaches. First, most methods are built upon
diffusion models, which are inherently ill-suited for equirectangular
projection (ERP) panoramas due to the violation of the identically and
independently distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise assumption caused by their
spherical mapping. Second, these methods often treat text-conditioned
generation (text-to-panorama) and image-conditioned generation (panorama
outpainting) as separate tasks, relying on distinct architectures and
task-specific data. In this work, we propose a unified framework, Panoramic
AutoRegressive model (PAR), which leverages masked autoregressive modeling to
address these challenges. PAR avoids the i.i.d. assumption constraint and
integrates text and image conditioning into a cohesive architecture, enabling
seamless generation across tasks. To address the inherent discontinuity in
existing generative models, we introduce circular padding to enhance spatial
coherence and propose a consistency alignment strategy to improve generation
quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive performance in
text-to-image generation and panorama outpainting tasks while showcasing
promising scalability and generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散Transformer模型的计算需求过高，限制了其实际部署。主要问题包括自注意力的二次复杂性和扩散模型的多步特性。

Method: Jenga结合了动态注意力雕刻（使用3D空间填充曲线动态选择相关token交互）和渐进分辨率生成（逐步增加潜在分辨率）。

Result: 实验表明，Jenga在多个先进视频扩散模型上实现了显著加速（8.83倍速度提升，VBench性能仅下降0.01%）。

Conclusion: Jenga作为一种即插即用解决方案，无需重新训练模型，即可将推理时间从分钟级降至秒级，实现高质量视频生成。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable generation quality of video Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) models, their practical deployment is severely hindered by extensive
computational requirements. This inefficiency stems from two key challenges:
the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to token length and the
multi-step nature of diffusion models. To address these limitations, we present
Jenga, a novel inference pipeline that combines dynamic attention carving with
progressive resolution generation. Our approach leverages two key insights: (1)
early denoising steps do not require high-resolution latents, and (2) later
steps do not require dense attention. Jenga introduces a block-wise attention
mechanism that dynamically selects relevant token interactions using 3D
space-filling curves, alongside a progressive resolution strategy that
gradually increases latent resolution during generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that Jenga achieves substantial speedups across multiple
state-of-the-art video diffusion models while maintaining comparable generation
quality (8.83$\times$ speedup with 0.01\% performance drop on VBench). As a
plug-and-play solution, Jenga enables practical, high-quality video generation
on modern hardware by reducing inference time from minutes to seconds --
without requiring model retraining. Code:

TLDR: 论文提出了T2I-ConBench，一个用于文本到图像模型持续后训练的统一基准，解决了缺乏标准化评估协议的问题，并分析了四种维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续后训练可以避免为每个新任务单独训练模型，但现有方法容易遗忘预训练知识并损害零样本组合性，且缺乏标准化评估协议。

Method: 引入T2I-ConBench基准，结合自动化指标、人类偏好建模和视觉语言问答，评估四种维度：通用性保留、目标任务性能、灾难性遗忘和跨任务泛化。

Result: 测试了十种代表性方法，发现没有方法在所有方面表现优异，跨任务泛化仍未解决。

Conclusion: T2I-ConBench为文本到图像模型的持续后训练研究提供了标准化评估工具，并公开了数据集和代码以加速研究。

Abstract: Continual post-training adapts a single text-to-image diffusion model to
learn new tasks without incurring the cost of separate models, but naive
post-training causes forgetting of pretrained knowledge and undermines
zero-shot compositionality. We observe that the absence of a standardized
evaluation protocol hampers related research for continual post-training. To
address this, we introduce T2I-ConBench, a unified benchmark for continual
post-training of text-to-image models. T2I-ConBench focuses on two practical
scenarios, item customization and domain enhancement, and analyzes four
dimensions: (1) retention of generality, (2) target-task performance, (3)
catastrophic forgetting, and (4) cross-task generalization. It combines
automated metrics, human-preference modeling, and vision-language QA for
comprehensive assessment. We benchmark ten representative methods across three
realistic task sequences and find that no approach excels on all fronts. Even
joint "oracle" training does not succeed for every task, and cross-task
generalization remains unsolved. We release all datasets, code, and evaluation
tools to accelerate research in continual post-training for text-to-image
models.

Abstract: Ethological research increasingly benefits from the growing affordability and
accessibility of drones, which enable the capture of high-resolution footage of
animal movement at fine spatial and temporal scales. However, analyzing such
footage presents the technical challenge of separating animal movement from
drone motion. While non-trivial, computer vision techniques such as image
registration and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) offer practical solutions. For
conservationists, open-source tools that are user-friendly, require minimal
setup, and deliver timely results are especially valuable for efficient data
interpretation. This study evaluates three approaches: a bioimaging-based
registration technique, an SfM pipeline, and a hybrid interpolation method. We
apply these to a recorded escape event involving 44 plains zebras, captured in
a single drone video. Using the best-performing method, we extract individual
trajectories and identify key behavioral patterns: increased alignment
(polarization) during escape, a brief widening of spacing just before stopping,
and tighter coordination near the group's center. These insights highlight the
method's effectiveness and its potential to scale to larger datasets,
contributing to broader investigations of collective animal behavior.

Conclusion: RealEngine通过逼真渲染和几何精度，为驾驶代理的评估提供了高效且全面的模拟环境。

Abstract: Driving simulation plays a crucial role in developing reliable driving agents
by providing controlled, evaluative environments. To enable meaningful
assessments, a high-quality driving simulator must satisfy several key
requirements: multi-modal sensing capabilities (e.g., camera and LiDAR) with
realistic scene rendering to minimize observational discrepancies; closed-loop
evaluation to support free-form trajectory behaviors; highly diverse traffic
scenarios for thorough evaluation; multi-agent cooperation to capture
interaction dynamics; and high computational efficiency to ensure affordability
and scalability. However, existing simulators and benchmarks fail to
comprehensively meet these fundamental criteria. To bridge this gap, this paper
introduces RealEngine, a novel driving simulation framework that holistically
integrates 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis techniques to
achieve realistic and flexible closed-loop simulation in the driving context.
By leveraging real-world multi-modal sensor data, RealEngine reconstructs
background scenes and foreground traffic participants separately, allowing for
highly diverse and realistic traffic scenarios through flexible scene
composition. This synergistic fusion of scene reconstruction and view synthesis
enables photorealistic rendering across multiple sensor modalities, ensuring
both perceptual fidelity and geometric accuracy. Building upon this
environment, RealEngine supports three essential driving simulation categories:
non-reactive simulation, safety testing, and multi-agent interaction,
collectively forming a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the
real-world performance of driving agents.

Method: 提出DetailMaster基准，包含四个关键评估维度（如属性绑定、空间关系），并测试了12种T2I模型。

Result: 现有模型在关键维度上仅达到约50%准确率，且性能随提示长度增加而下降。

Abstract: While recent text-to-image (T2I) models show impressive capabilities in
synthesizing images from brief descriptions, their performance significantly
degrades when confronted with long, detail-intensive prompts required in
professional applications. We present DetailMaster, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate T2I models' systematical abilities
to handle extended textual inputs that contain complex compositional
requirements. Our benchmark introduces four critical evaluation dimensions:
Character Attributes, Structured Character Locations, Multi-Dimensional Scene
Attributes, and Explicit Spatial/Interactive Relationships. The benchmark
comprises long and detail-rich prompts averaging 284.89 tokens, with high
quality validated by expert annotators. Evaluation on 7 general-purpose and 5
long-prompt-optimized T2I models reveals critical performance limitations:
state-of-the-art models achieve merely ~50% accuracy in key dimensions like
attribute binding and spatial reasoning, while all models showing progressive
performance degradation as prompt length increases. Our analysis highlights
systemic failures in structural comprehension and detail overload handling,
motivating future research into architectures with enhanced compositional
reasoning. We open-source the dataset, data curation code, and evaluation tools
to advance detail-rich T2I generation and enable broad applications that would
otherwise be infeasible due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark.

TLDR: 提出了一种更高效的全对相关体积采样实现方法，显著降低了内存使用和计算复杂度，同时保持与现有方法相同的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光流估计方法在处理高分辨率图像时，由于计算和内存复杂度过高，通常需要降低分辨率，导致细节丢失。

Method: 提出了一种更高效的全对相关体积采样实现方法，与RAFT定义的数学操作符完全匹配，同时显著降低内存使用。

Result: 新方法在内存使用上比默认实现低95%，比按需计算快90%，整体推理时间节省50%，并在高分辨率数据集上达到最优效果。

Conclusion: 该方法在内存受限环境下实现了高效的光流估计，同时在高分辨率图像上保持了高精度。

Abstract: Recent optical flow estimation methods often employ local cost sampling from
a dense all-pairs correlation volume. This results in quadratic computational
and memory complexity in the number of pixels. Although an alternative
memory-efficient implementation with on-demand cost computation exists, this is
slower in practice and therefore prior methods typically process images at
reduced resolutions, missing fine-grained details.
  To address this, we propose a more efficient implementation of the all-pairs
correlation volume sampling, still matching the exact mathematical operator as
defined by RAFT. Our approach outperforms on-demand sampling by up to 90% while
maintaining low memory usage, and performs on par with the default
implementation with up to 95% lower memory usage. As cost sampling makes up a
significant portion of the overall runtime, this can translate to up to 50%
savings for the total end-to-end model inference in memory-constrained
environments. Our evaluation of existing methods includes an 8K
ultra-high-resolution dataset and an additional inference-time modification of
the recent SEA-RAFT method. With this, we achieve state-of-the-art results at
high resolutions both in accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有医学VQA基准多关注单图像分析，而临床诊断通常需要比较多张图像，因此需开发更贴近实际的多图像推理评估工具。

Method: 开发自动化流程提取医学视频中的时序连贯帧，并通过多阶段过滤策略（模型和人工审核）确保数据质量，构建包含2,851个VQA对的数据集。

Result: 评估10种多模态LLM显示，模型表现普遍较差（准确率低于50%），且错误包括忽略关键发现、证据误聚合和错误传播。

Conclusion: MedFrameQA为多图像推理研究提供了基准，有望推动更强大的诊断AI系统发展。

Abstract: Existing medical VQA benchmarks mostly focus on single-image analysis, yet
clinicians almost always compare a series of images before reaching a
diagnosis. To better approximate this workflow, we introduce MedFrameQA -- the
first benchmark that explicitly evaluates multi-image reasoning in medical VQA.
To build MedFrameQA both at scale and in high-quality, we develop 1) an
automated pipeline that extracts temporally coherent frames from medical videos
and constructs VQA items whose content evolves logically across images, and 2)
a multiple-stage filtering strategy, including model-based and manual review,
to preserve data clarity, difficulty, and medical relevance. The resulting
dataset comprises 2,851 VQA pairs (gathered from 9,237 high-quality frames in
3,420 videos), covering nine human body systems and 43 organs; every question
is accompanied by two to five images. We comprehensively benchmark ten advanced
Multimodal LLMs -- both proprietary and open source, with and without explicit
reasoning modules -- on MedFrameQA. The evaluation challengingly reveals that
all models perform poorly, with most accuracies below 50%, and accuracy
fluctuates as the number of images per question increases. Error analysis
further shows that models frequently ignore salient findings, mis-aggregate
evidence across images, and propagate early mistakes through their reasoning
chains; results also vary substantially across body systems, organs, and
modalities. We hope this work can catalyze research on clinically grounded,
multi-image reasoning and accelerate progress toward more capable diagnostic AI
systems.

Conclusion: UniPhy提供了一种无需先验材料信息的通用方法，显著提升了材料特性推断的准确性和适用性。

Abstract: We propose UniPhy, a common latent-conditioned neural constitutive model that
can encode the physical properties of diverse materials. At inference UniPhy
allows `inverse simulation' i.e. inferring material properties by optimizing
the scene-specific latent to match the available observations via
differentiable simulation. In contrast to existing methods that treat such
inference as system identification, UniPhy does not rely on user-specified
material type information. Compared to prior neural constitutive modeling
approaches which learn instance specific networks, the shared training across
materials improves both, robustness and accuracy of the estimates. We train
UniPhy using simulated trajectories across diverse geometries and materials --
elastic, plasticine, sand, and fluids (Newtonian & non-Newtonian). At
inference, given an object with unknown material properties, UniPhy can infer
the material properties via latent optimization to match the motion
observations, and can then allow re-simulating the object under diverse
scenarios. We compare UniPhy against prior inverse simulation methods, and show
that the inference from UniPhy enables more accurate replay and re-simulation
under novel conditions.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) has drawn increasing attention for its
capacity to generalize segmentation beyond predefined categories. However,
existing methods typically predict segmentation masks with simple forward
inference, lacking explicit reasoning and interpretability. This makes it
challenging for OVS model to distinguish similar categories in open-world
settings due to the lack of contextual understanding and discriminative visual
cues. To address this limitation, we propose a step-by-step visual reasoning
framework for open-vocabulary segmentation, named OpenSeg-R. The proposed
OpenSeg-R leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to perform hierarchical
visual reasoning before segmentation. Specifically, we generate both generic
and image-specific reasoning for each image, forming structured triplets that
explain the visual reason for objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on
these reasoning steps, we can compose detailed description prompts, and feed
them to the segmentor to produce more accurate segmentation masks. To the best
of our knowledge, OpenSeg-R is the first framework to introduce explicit
step-by-step visual reasoning into OVS. Experimental results demonstrate that
OpenSeg-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation across five benchmark datasets. Moreover, it achieves
consistent gains across all metrics on open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation.
Qualitative results further highlight the effectiveness of our reasoning-guided
framework in improving both segmentation precision and interpretability. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/Hanzy1996/OpenSeg-R.

Abstract: Contemporary diffusion models show remarkable capability in text-to-image
generation, while still being limited to restricted resolutions (e.g., 1,024 X
1,024). Recent advances enable tuning-free higher-resolution image generation
by recycling pre-trained diffusion models and extending them via regional
denoising or dilated sampling/convolutions. However, these models struggle to
simultaneously preserve global semantic structure and produce creative regional
details in higher-resolution images. To address this, we present C-Upscale, a
new recipe of tuning-free image upscaling that pivots on global-regional priors
derived from given global prompt and estimated regional prompts via Multimodal
LLM. Technically, the low-frequency component of low-resolution image is
recognized as global structure prior to encourage global semantic consistency
in high-resolution generation. Next, we perform regional attention control to
screen cross-attention between global prompt and each region during regional
denoising, leading to regional attention prior that alleviates object
repetition issue. The estimated regional prompts containing rich descriptive
details further act as regional semantic prior to fuel the creativity of
regional detail generation. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our C-Upscale manages to generate ultra-high-resolution images
(e.g., 4,096 X 4,096 and 8,192 X 8,192) with higher visual fidelity and more
creative regional details.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过语义点匹配和3D感知线索有效改进了扩散模型在虚拟试穿任务中的表现。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown preliminary success in virtual try-on (VTON)
task. The typical dual-branch architecture comprises two UNets for implicit
garment deformation and synthesized image generation respectively, and has
emerged as the recipe for VTON task. Nevertheless, the problem remains
challenging to preserve the shape and every detail of the given garment due to
the intrinsic stochasticity of diffusion model. To alleviate this issue, we
novelly propose to explicitly capitalize on visual correspondence as the prior
to tame diffusion process instead of simply feeding the whole garment into UNet
as the appearance reference. Specifically, we interpret the fine-grained
appearance and texture details as a set of structured semantic points, and
match the semantic points rooted in garment to the ones over target person
through local flow warping. Such 2D points are then augmented into 3D-aware
cues with depth/normal map of target person. The correspondence mimics the way
of putting clothing on human body and the 3D-aware cues act as semantic point
matching to supervise diffusion model training. A point-focused diffusion loss
is further devised to fully take the advantage of semantic point matching.
Extensive experiments demonstrate strong garment detail preservation of our
approach, evidenced by state-of-the-art VTON performances on both VITON-HD and
DressCode datasets. Code is publicly available at:

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为DPIDM的新框架，利用扩散模型解决视频虚拟试穿中的动态姿态交互问题，显著提升了时间一致性和视觉效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频虚拟试穿方法多关注时间模块，但忽略了人与服装之间的时空姿态交互，导致效果不佳。

Method: DPIDM通过骨架姿态适配器和分层注意力模块，结合空间和时间注意力机制，建模帧内和跨帧的姿态交互，并利用时间正则化注意力损失增强一致性。

Result: 在VITON-HD、VVT和ViViD数据集上，DPIDM表现优异，VFID分数为0.506，比现有最佳方法提升60.5%。

Conclusion: DPIDM通过动态姿态交互建模，显著提升了视频虚拟试穿的效果和时间一致性。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly dress a subject in a video with a
specific garment. The primary challenge involves preserving the visual
authenticity of the garment while dynamically adapting to the pose and physique
of the subject. While existing methods have predominantly focused on
image-based virtual try-on, extending these techniques directly to videos often
results in temporal inconsistencies. Most current video virtual try-on
approaches alleviate this challenge by incorporating temporal modules, yet
still overlook the critical spatiotemporal pose interactions between human and
garment. Effective pose interactions in videos should not only consider spatial
alignment between human and garment poses in each frame but also account for
the temporal dynamics of human poses throughout the entire video. With such
motivation, we propose a new framework, namely Dynamic Pose Interaction
Diffusion Models (DPIDM), to leverage diffusion models to delve into dynamic
pose interactions for video virtual try-on. Technically, DPIDM introduces a
skeleton-based pose adapter to integrate synchronized human and garment poses
into the denoising network. A hierarchical attention module is then exquisitely
designed to model intra-frame human-garment pose interactions and long-term
human pose dynamics across frames through pose-aware spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms. Moreover, DPIDM capitalizes on a temporal regularized
attention loss between consecutive frames to enhance temporal consistency.
Extensive experiments conducted on VITON-HD, VVT and ViViD datasets demonstrate
the superiority of our DPIDM against the baseline methods. Notably, DPIDM
achieves VFID score of 0.506 on VVT dataset, leading to 60.5% improvement over
the state-of-the-art GPD-VVTO approach.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为Feature Mixing的快速多模态异常合成方法，用于改进OOD检测和分割，并在多个数据集上实现了显著的性能提升和速度优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界应用多为多模态，而现有研究主要关注单模态图像数据，缺乏对未知数据的监督信号，导致OOD样本预测过于自信。

Method: 提出Feature Mixing方法，通过多模态特征混合合成异常数据，理论支持其有效性，并适用于多种模态组合。

Result: 在多个数据集（如SemanticKITTI、nuScenes、CARLA-OOD）上实现了最先进的性能，速度提升10至370倍。

Conclusion: Feature Mixing是一种简单高效的多模态OOD检测方法，适用于多种应用场景，并开源了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and segmentation are crucial for
deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as
autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery. While prior research has
primarily focused on unimodal image data, real-world applications are
inherently multimodal, requiring the integration of multiple modalities for
improved OOD detection. A key challenge is the lack of supervision signals from
unknown data, leading to overconfident predictions on OOD samples. To address
this challenge, we propose Feature Mixing, an extremely simple and fast method
for multimodal outlier synthesis with theoretical support, which can be further
optimized to help the model better distinguish between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD data. Feature Mixing is modality-agnostic and applicable to various
modality combinations. Additionally, we introduce CARLA-OOD, a novel multimodal
dataset for OOD segmentation, featuring synthetic OOD objects across diverse
scenes and weather conditions. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI,
nuScenes, CARLA-OOD datasets, and the MultiOOD benchmark demonstrate that
Feature Mixing achieves state-of-the-art performance with a $10 \times$ to $370
\times$ speedup. Our source code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 解决纯离散扩散方法导致的训练不稳定、性能不佳和长度偏差问题。

Result: Dimple-7B性能提升3.9%，推理迭代次数减少至响应长度的1/3，预填充技术提速1.5x至7x。

Conclusion: 验证了DMLLM的可行性和优势，提升了推理效率和可控性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose Dimple, the first Discrete Diffusion Multimodal
Large Language Model (DMLLM). We observe that training with a purely discrete
diffusion approach leads to significant training instability, suboptimal
performance, and severe length bias issues. To address these challenges, we
design a novel training paradigm that combines an initial autoregressive phase
with a subsequent diffusion phase. This approach yields the Dimple-7B model,
trained on the same dataset and using a similar training pipeline as
LLaVA-NEXT. Dimple-7B ultimately surpasses LLaVA-NEXT in performance by 3.9%,
demonstrating that DMLLM can achieve performance comparable to that of
autoregressive models. To improve inference efficiency, we propose a decoding
strategy termed confident decoding, which dynamically adjusts the number of
tokens generated at each step, significantly reducing the number of generation
iterations. In autoregressive models, the number of forward iterations during
generation equals the response length. With confident decoding, however, the
number of iterations needed by Dimple is even only $\frac{\text{response
length}}{3}$. We also re-implement the prefilling technique in autoregressive
models and demonstrate that it does not significantly impact performance on
most benchmark evaluations, while offering a speedup of 1.5x to 7x.
Additionally, we explore Dimple's capability to precisely control its response
using structure priors. These priors enable structured responses in a manner
distinct from instruction-based or chain-of-thought prompting, and allow
fine-grained control over response format and length, which is difficult to
achieve in autoregressive models. Overall, this work validates the feasibility
and advantages of DMLLM and enhances its inference efficiency and
controllability. Code and models are available at

Result: 在ASR基准测试中，实现了三倍训练加速和最高12.54%的词错误率改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大型ASR模型在低资源设备上的部署问题，同时显著提升了小型模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancement in deep learning encouraged developing large automatic
speech recognition (ASR) models that achieve promising results while ignoring
computational and memory constraints. However, deploying such models on low
resource devices is impractical despite of their favorable performance.
Existing approaches (pruning, distillation, layer skip etc.) transform the
large models into smaller ones at the cost of significant performance
degradation or require prolonged training of smaller models for better
performance. To address these issues, we introduce an efficacious two-step
representation learning based approach capable of producing several small sized
models from a single large model ensuring considerably better performance in
limited number of epochs. Comprehensive experimentation on ASR benchmarks
reveals the efficacy of our approach, achieving three-fold training speed-up
and up to 12.54% word error rate improvement.

Conclusion: 为原生、主干级分割提供了新范式，无需掩码监督即可实现强零样本效果。

Abstract: Uniform downsampling remains the de facto standard for reducing spatial
resolution in vision backbones. In this work, we propose an alternative design
built around a content-aware spatial grouping layer, that dynamically assigns
tokens to a reduced set based on image boundaries and their semantic content.
Stacking our grouping layer across consecutive backbone stages results in
hierarchical segmentation that arises natively in the feature extraction
process, resulting in our coined Native Segmentation Vision Transformer. We
show that a careful design of our architecture enables the emergence of strong
segmentation masks solely from grouping layers, that is, without additional
segmentation-specific heads. This sets the foundation for a new paradigm of
native, backbone-level segmentation, which enables strong zero-shot results
without mask supervision, as well as a minimal and efficient standalone model
design for downstream segmentation tasks. Our project page is

sparse-view natural and the extremely-large viewpoint changes between satellite

observation that street-view specific elements, including the sky and
illumination effects are only visible in street-view panoramas, and present a
novel approach Sat2Density++ to accomplish the goal of photo-realistic
street-view panoramas rendering by modeling these street-view specific in

Abstract: We study the task of learning association between faces and voices, which is
gaining interest in the multimodal community lately. These methods suffer from
the deliberate crafting of negative mining procedures as well as the reliance
on the distant margin parameter. These issues are addressed by learning a joint
embedding space in which orthogonality constraints are applied to the fused
embeddings of faces and voices. However, embedding spaces of faces and voices
possess different characteristics and require spaces to be aligned before
fusing them. To this end, we propose a method that accurately aligns the
embedding spaces and fuses them with an enhanced gated fusion thereby improving
the performance of face-voice association. Extensive experiments on the
VoxCeleb dataset reveals the merits of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: CoMo通过连续运动表示和新指标，显著提升了运动学习的效果，适用于多种视频域和任务。

Abstract: Learning latent motion from Internet videos is crucial for building
generalist robots. However, existing discrete latent action methods suffer from
information loss and struggle with complex and fine-grained dynamics. We
propose CoMo, which aims to learn more informative continuous motion
representations from diverse, internet-scale videos. CoMo employs a early
temporal feature difference mechanism to prevent model collapse and suppress
static appearance noise, effectively discouraging shortcut learning problem.
Furthermore, guided by the information bottleneck principle, we constrain the
latent motion embedding dimensionality to achieve a better balance between
retaining sufficient action-relevant information and minimizing the inclusion
of action-irrelevant appearance noise. Additionally, we also introduce two new
metrics for more robustly and affordably evaluating motion and guiding motion
learning methods development: (i) the linear probing MSE of action prediction,
and (ii) the cosine similarity between past-to-current and future-to-current
motion embeddings. Critically, CoMo exhibits strong zero-shot generalization,
enabling it to generate continuous pseudo actions for previously unseen video
domains. This capability facilitates unified policy joint learning using pseudo
actions derived from various action-less video datasets (such as
cross-embodiment videos and, notably, human demonstration videos), potentially
augmented with limited labeled robot data. Extensive experiments show that
policies co-trained with CoMo pseudo actions achieve superior performance with
both diffusion and autoregressive architectures in simulated and real-world
settings.

<details>

Motivation: 人工分析岩石薄片矿物学特征存在主观性和耗时性问题，现有技术如QEMSCAN成本高且耗时，因此需要一种更高效、低成本的自动化方法。

Method: 使用U-Net语义分割架构，基于平面和交叉偏振薄片图像训练模型，以QEMSCAN映射为目标，区分多种矿物相。

Result: 模型在矿物边界划分和分布估计方面表现良好，R^2值在训练过的岩相中超过0.97，未训练过的岩相中为0.88。

Conclusion: 模型展示了良好的泛化能力，但分割质量受图像分辨率差异和岩石纹理多样性影响。

Abstract: Interpreting the mineralogical aspects of rock thin sections is an important
task for oil and gas reservoirs evaluation. However, human analysis tend to be
subjective and laborious. Technologies like QEMSCAN(R) are designed to automate
the mineralogical mapping process, but also suffer from limitations like high
monetary costs and time-consuming analysis. This work proposes a Convolutional
Neural Network model for automatic mineralogical segmentation of thin section
images of carbonate rocks. The model is able to mimic the QEMSCAN mapping
itself in a low-cost, generalized and efficient manner. For this, the U-Net
semantic segmentation architecture is trained on plane and cross polarized thin
section images using the corresponding QEMSCAN maps as target, which is an
approach not widely explored. The model was instructed to differentiate
occurrences of Calcite, Dolomite, Mg-Clay Minerals, Quartz, Pores and the
remaining mineral phases as an unique class named "Others", while it was
validated on rock facies both seen and unseen during training, in order to
address its generalization capability. Since the images and maps are provided
in different resolutions, image registration was applied to align then
spatially. The study reveals that the quality of the segmentation is very much
dependent on these resolution differences and on the variety of learnable rock
textures. However, it shows promising results, especially with regard to the
proper delineation of minerals boundaries on solid textures and precise
estimation of the minerals distributions, describing a nearly linear
relationship between expected and predicted distributions, with coefficient of
determination (R^2) superior to 0.97 for seen facies and 0.88 for unseen.

Conclusion: AdapTok实现了样本级、内容感知的动态标记分配，提高了视频建模的可扩展性和标记效率。

Abstract: We propose AdapTok, an adaptive temporal causal video tokenizer that can
flexibly allocate tokens for different frames based on video content. AdapTok
is equipped with a block-wise masking strategy that randomly drops tail tokens
of each block during training, and a block causal scorer to predict the
reconstruction quality of video frames using different numbers of tokens.
During inference, an adaptive token allocation strategy based on integer linear
programming is further proposed to adjust token usage given predicted scores.
Such design allows for sample-wise, content-aware, and temporally dynamic token
allocation under a controllable overall budget. Extensive experiments for video
reconstruction and generation on UCF-101 and Kinetics-600 demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Without additional image data, AdapTok
consistently improves reconstruction quality and generation performance under
different token budgets, allowing for more scalable and token-efficient
generative video modeling.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced in visual

leaving them ill-suited for robotics and other real-world applications that
require multi-frame reasoning. In this paper, we propose a framework to equip
MLLMs with robust multi-frame spatial understanding by integrating depth

introduce a comprehensive benchmark that tests a wide spectrum of spatial tasks
under uniform metrics. Our resulting model, Multi-SpatialMLLM, achieves
significant gains over baselines and proprietary systems, demonstrating
scalable, generalizable multi-frame reasoning. We further observe multi-task
benefits and early indications of emergent capabilities in challenging
scenarios, and showcase how our model can serve as a multi-frame reward

Abstract: Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central
to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image
generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents
unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass
ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and
designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler
rule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these
explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific
challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this
gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO
algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain
performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of
different reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal
that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward
models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially
enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore,
we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both
their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into
efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a
new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms
to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image
generation. Code is released at

Abstract: Recent advances have shown success in eliciting strong reasoning abilities in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through rule-based reinforcement
learning (RL) with outcome rewards. However, this paradigm typically lacks
supervision over the thinking process leading to the final outcome.As a result,
the model may learn sub-optimal reasoning strategies, which can hinder its
generalization ability. In light of this, we propose SophiaVL-R1, as an attempt
to add reward signals for the thinking process in this paradigm. To achieve
this, we first train a thinking reward model that evaluates the quality of the
entire thinking process. Given that the thinking reward may be unreliable for
certain samples due to reward hacking, we propose the Trust-GRPO method, which
assigns a trustworthiness weight to the thinking reward during training. This
weight is computed based on the thinking reward comparison of responses leading
to correct answers versus incorrect answers, helping to mitigate the impact of
potentially unreliable thinking rewards. Moreover, we design an annealing
training strategy that gradually reduces the thinking reward over time,
allowing the model to rely more on the accurate rule-based outcome reward in
later training stages. Experiments show that our SophiaVL-R1 surpasses a series
of reasoning MLLMs on various benchmarks (e.g., MathVisita, MMMU),
demonstrating strong reasoning and generalization capabilities. Notably, our
SophiaVL-R1-7B even outperforms LLaVA-OneVision-72B on most benchmarks, despite
the latter having 10 times more parameters. All code, models, and datasets are
made publicly available at https://github.com/kxfan2002/SophiaVL-R1.

*Chenhao Zhang,Yazhe Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出Let Androids Dream (LAD)框架，通过三阶段方法解决图像隐喻理解问题，性能优于现有MLLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统难以理解图像中的文化、情感和上下文隐喻，LAD旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：感知（视觉信息转文本）、搜索（跨域知识整合）、推理（生成上下文对齐的隐喻解释）。

Result: 在英文和中文图像隐喻基准测试中表现优异，部分任务超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: LAD为AI理解图像隐喻提供了新思路，推动了视觉语言推理和人机交互的发展。

Abstract: Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for AI
systems, as existing models struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional,
and contextual implications embedded in visual content. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) excel in basic Visual Question Answer (VQA) tasks, they
struggle with a fundamental limitation on image implication tasks: contextual
gaps that obscure the relationships between different visual elements and their
abstract meanings. Inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Let
Androids Dream (LAD), a novel framework for image implication understanding and
reasoning. LAD addresses contextual missing through the three-stage framework:
(1) Perception: converting visual information into rich and multi-level textual
representations, (2) Search: iteratively searching and integrating cross-domain
knowledge to resolve ambiguity, and (3) Reasoning: generating context-alignment
image implication via explicit reasoning. Our framework with the lightweight
GPT-4o-mini model achieves SOTA performance compared to 15+ MLLMs on English
image implication benchmark and a huge improvement on Chinese benchmark,
performing comparable with the GPT-4o model on Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ)
and outperforms 36.7% on Open-Style Question (OSQ). Additionally, our work
provides new insights into how AI can more effectively interpret image
implications, advancing the field of vision-language reasoning and human-AI
interaction. Our project is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: CrossLMM通过双交叉注意力机制减少长视频序列中的视觉令牌数量，显著降低计算成本，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着输入复杂性增加（如长视频序列），所需令牌数量激增，导致计算成本二次增长，亟需高效压缩视频令牌的方法。

Method: 采用池化方法减少视觉令牌数量，并在LLM层中引入视觉-视觉和文本-视觉交叉注意力机制，优化令牌利用。

Result: 在多种视频LMM基准测试中表现优异，计算资源消耗显著减少。

Conclusion: CrossLMM为高效处理多模态数据提供了可行方案，平衡了性能与计算成本。

Abstract: The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has significantly enhanced Large
Language Models (LLMs) to process and interpret diverse data modalities (e.g.,
image and video). However, as input complexity increases, particularly with
long video sequences, the number of required tokens has grown significantly,
leading to quadratically computational costs. This has made the efficient
compression of video tokens in LMMs, while maintaining performance integrity, a
pressing research challenge. In this paper, we introduce CrossLMM, decoupling
long video sequences from LMMs via a dual cross-attention mechanism, which
substantially reduces visual token quantity with minimal performance
degradation. Specifically, we first implement a significant token reduction
from pretrained visual encoders through a pooling methodology. Then, within LLM
layers, we employ a visual-to-visual cross-attention mechanism, wherein the
pooled visual tokens function as queries against the original visual token set.
This module enables more efficient token utilization while retaining
fine-grained informational fidelity. In addition, we introduce a text-to-visual
cross-attention mechanism, for which the text tokens are enhanced through
interaction with the original visual tokens, enriching the visual comprehension
of the text tokens. Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that our
approach achieves comparable or superior performance across diverse video-based
LMM benchmarks, despite utilizing substantially fewer computational resources.

Motivation: 现有基准多关注英语，忽视了阿拉伯语等丰富语言和文化背景，需填补这一空白。

Method: 构建ARB基准，包含1,356个多模态样本和5,119个人工标注的推理步骤，评估12种LMM模型。

Result: 模型在连贯性、忠实性和文化背景方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: ARB为多模态推理提供了结构化框架，推动更具包容性和文化意识的AI发展。

Abstract: As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) become more capable, there is growing
interest in evaluating their reasoning processes alongside their final outputs.
However, most benchmarks remain focused on English, overlooking languages with
rich linguistic and cultural contexts, such as Arabic. To address this gap, we
introduce the Comprehensive Arabic Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark (ARB), the
first benchmark designed to evaluate step-by-step reasoning in Arabic across
both textual and visual modalities. ARB spans 11 diverse domains, including
visual reasoning, document understanding, OCR, scientific analysis, and
cultural interpretation. It comprises 1,356 multimodal samples paired with
5,119 human-curated reasoning steps and corresponding actions. We evaluated 12
state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LMMs and found persistent challenges
in coherence, faithfulness, and cultural grounding. ARB offers a structured
framework for diagnosing multimodal reasoning in underrepresented languages and
marks a critical step toward inclusive, transparent, and culturally aware AI
systems. We release the benchmark, rubric, and evaluation suit to support
future research and reproducibility. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉生成模型在处理复杂提示（涉及多对象精确空间关系和属性）时表现不佳，需要更有效的语义和空间推理能力。

Method: GoT-R1采用强化学习，结合双阶段多维奖励框架，利用MLLMs评估推理过程和最终输出，统一监督语义对齐、空间准确性和视觉质量。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench基准测试中，GoT-R1在涉及精确空间关系和属性绑定的任务上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: GoT-R1通过将复杂推理能力引入视觉生成领域，推动了图像生成技术的进步，并公开了代码和预训练模型以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Visual generation models have made remarkable progress in creating realistic
images from text prompts, yet struggle with complex prompts that specify
multiple objects with precise spatial relationships and attributes. Effective
handling of such prompts requires explicit reasoning about the semantic content
and spatial layout. We present GoT-R1, a framework that applies reinforcement
learning to enhance semantic-spatial reasoning in visual generation. Building
upon the Generation Chain-of-Thought approach, GoT-R1 enables models to
autonomously discover effective reasoning strategies beyond predefined
templates through carefully designed reinforcement learning. To achieve this,
we propose a dual-stage multi-dimensional reward framework that leverages MLLMs
to evaluate both the reasoning process and final output, enabling effective
supervision across the entire generation pipeline. The reward system assesses
semantic alignment, spatial accuracy, and visual quality in a unified approach.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements on T2I-CompBench
benchmark, particularly in compositional tasks involving precise spatial
relationships and attribute binding. GoT-R1 advances the state-of-the-art in
image generation by successfully transferring sophisticated reasoning
capabilities to the visual generation domain. To facilitate future research, we
make our code and pretrained models publicly available at

TLDR: MAPS是一个多语言基准测试套件，旨在评估基于LLM的代理AI系统在多种语言和任务中的表现，填补了现有基准测试仅关注英语的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在多语言环境中表现不佳，代理AI系统可能继承这些限制，影响全球用户的可靠性和安全性，因此需要多语言评估工具。

Method: MAPS基于四个广泛使用的代理基准测试（GAIA、SWE-bench、MATH和Agent Security Benchmark），将其翻译成十种语言，生成805个任务和8,855个语言特定实例。

Result: 实验表明，从英语切换到其他语言时，代理的性能和安全性普遍下降，严重程度因任务和翻译输入量而异。

Conclusion: MAPS为多语言环境下的代理AI系统开发和评估提供了标准化框架，促进公平、可靠且全球可访问的AI研究。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which build on Large Language Models (LLMs) and interact
with tools and memory, have rapidly advanced in capability and scope. Yet,
since LLMs have been shown to struggle in multilingual settings, typically
resulting in lower performance and reduced safety, agentic systems risk
inheriting these limitations. This raises concerns about the global
accessibility of such systems, as users interacting in languages other than
English may encounter unreliable or security-critical agent behavior. Despite
growing interest in evaluating agentic AI, existing benchmarks focus
exclusively on English, leaving multilingual settings unexplored. To address
this gap, we propose MAPS, a multilingual benchmark suite designed to evaluate
agentic AI systems across diverse languages and tasks. MAPS builds on four
widely used agentic benchmarks - GAIA (real-world tasks), SWE-bench (code
generation), MATH (mathematical reasoning), and the Agent Security Benchmark
(security). We translate each dataset into ten diverse languages, resulting in
805 unique tasks and 8,855 total language-specific instances. Our benchmark
suite enables a systematic analysis of how multilingual contexts affect agent
performance and robustness. Empirically, we observe consistent degradation in
both performance and security when transitioning from English to other
languages, with severity varying by task and correlating with the amount of
translated input. Building on these findings, we provide actionable
recommendations to guide agentic AI systems development and assessment under
multilingual settings. This work establishes a standardized evaluation
framework, encouraging future research towards equitable, reliable, and
globally accessible agentic AI. MAPS benchmark suite is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为DuFFin的双层指纹框架，用于在黑盒设置下验证大型语言模型（LLM）的所有权，解决了现有方法对文本生成过程的影响或需要白盒访问的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护大型语言模型的知识产权（IP）免受恶意窃取或未经授权部署的威胁，现有方法存在不足。

Method: DuFFin通过提取触发模式和知识级指纹来识别可疑模型的来源，支持黑盒设置。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能准确验证基础保护LLM在其变体上的版权，IP-ROC指标大于0.95。

Conclusion: DuFFin是一种高效且实用的LLM知识产权保护方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are considered valuable Intellectual Properties
(IP) for legitimate owners due to the enormous computational cost of training.
It is crucial to protect the IP of LLMs from malicious stealing or unauthorized
deployment. Despite existing efforts in watermarking and fingerprinting LLMs,
these methods either impact the text generation process or are limited in
white-box access to the suspect model, making them impractical. Hence, we
propose DuFFin, a novel $\textbf{Du}$al-Level $\textbf{Fin}$gerprinting
$\textbf{F}$ramework for black-box setting ownership verification. DuFFin
extracts the trigger pattern and the knowledge-level fingerprints to identify
the source of a suspect model. We conduct experiments on a variety of models
collected from the open-source website, including four popular base models as
protected LLMs and their fine-tuning, quantization, and safety alignment
versions, which are released by large companies, start-ups, and individual
users. Results show that our method can accurately verify the copyright of the
base protected LLM on their model variants, achieving the IP-ROC metric greater
than 0.95. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Collapse Trap（CTRAP）的新防御机制，通过诱导模型崩溃来防止恶意微调攻击，而非选择性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性遗忘方法无法有效防止LLMs因强大适应性而重新学习或转向恶意任务，需要一种更彻底的防御手段。

Method: 提出CTRAP机制，在模型对齐时预配置崩溃触发条件，若检测到恶意微调则逐步削弱模型核心能力。

Result: 实验证明CTRAP能有效抵御多种LLMs的恶意微调攻击，同时不影响正常微调的性能。

Conclusion: CTRAP通过模型崩溃机制解决了选择性遗忘的局限性，为LLM安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-tuning-as-a-service, while commercially successful for Large Language
Model (LLM) providers, exposes models to harmful fine-tuning attacks. As a
widely explored defense paradigm against such attacks, unlearning attempts to
remove malicious knowledge from LLMs, thereby essentially preventing them from
being used to perform malicious tasks. However, we highlight a critical flaw:
the powerful general adaptability of LLMs allows them to easily bypass
selective unlearning by rapidly relearning or repurposing their capabilities
for harmful tasks. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a
paradigm shift: instead of selective removal, we advocate for inducing model
collapse--effectively forcing the model to "unlearn everything"--specifically
in response to updates characteristic of malicious adaptation. This collapse
directly neutralizes the very general capabilities that attackers exploit,
tackling the core issue unaddressed by selective unlearning. We introduce the
Collapse Trap (CTRAP) as a practical mechanism to implement this concept
conditionally. Embedded during alignment, CTRAP pre-configures the model's
reaction to subsequent fine-tuning dynamics. If updates during fine-tuning
constitute a persistent attempt to reverse safety alignment, the pre-configured
trap triggers a progressive degradation of the model's core language modeling
abilities, ultimately rendering it inert and useless for the attacker.
Crucially, this collapse mechanism remains dormant during benign fine-tuning,
ensuring the model's utility and general capabilities are preserved for
legitimate users. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that CTRAP
effectively counters harmful fine-tuning risks across various LLMs and attack
settings, while maintaining high performance in benign scenarios. Our code is
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CTRAP.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新型安全威胁：通过操纵LLMs的系统提示，使其在特定目标问题上生成恶意回答，同时在其他问题上表现正常。攻击算法CAIN能在黑盒设置下自动生成此类有害提示，并在实验中表现出显著的对抗效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs易受对抗攻击，但现有研究未充分探讨通过系统提示操纵对话的威胁。本文旨在揭示这种攻击的潜在危害及其大规模信息操纵的可能性。

Method: 提出CAIN算法，自动生成针对特定问题的有害系统提示，无需访问LLM参数，适用于黑盒设置。

Result: CAIN在非目标攻击中使目标问题F1下降40%，在目标攻击中使特定有害回答的F1超过70%，同时对良性问题影响最小。

Conclusion: 研究强调了增强LLMs鲁棒性的紧迫性，以确保其在现实应用中的安全性和完整性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many applications, but are also
known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce a
novel security threat: hijacking AI-human conversations by manipulating LLMs'
system prompts to produce malicious answers only to specific targeted questions
(e.g., "Who should I vote for US President?", "Are Covid vaccines safe?"),
while behaving benignly on others. This attack is detrimental as it can enable
malicious actors to exercise large-scale information manipulation by spreading
harmful but benign-looking system prompts online. To demonstrate such an
attack, we develop CAIN, an algorithm that can automatically curate such
harmful system prompts for a specific target question in a black-box setting or
without the need to access the LLM's parameters. Evaluated on both open-source
and commercial LLMs, CAIN demonstrates significant adversarial impact. In
untargeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output incorrect answers, CAIN achieves
up to 40% F1 degradation on targeted questions while preserving high accuracy
on benign inputs. For targeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output specific
harmful answers, CAIN achieves over 70% F1 scores on these targeted responses
with minimal impact on benign questions. Our results highlight the critical
need for enhanced robustness measures to safeguard the integrity and safety of
LLMs in real-world applications. All source code will be publicly available.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在微调即服务（FTaaS）中存在后门攻击风险，恶意微调可植入后门。

Method: BYE框架通过三阶段流程：提取注意力图、计算熵分数和敏感层分析、无监督聚类过滤可疑样本。

Result: BYE在多种数据集和触发类型下实现接近零的攻击成功率，同时保持干净任务性能。

Conclusion: BYE为MLLMs中的后门威胁提供了一种鲁棒且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in
fine-tuning-as-a-service (FTaaS) settings, where user-submitted datasets adapt
general-purpose models to downstream tasks. This flexibility, however,
introduces serious security risks, as malicious fine-tuning can implant
backdoors into MLLMs with minimal effort. In this paper, we observe that
backdoor triggers systematically disrupt cross-modal processing by causing
abnormal attention concentration on non-semantic regions--a phenomenon we term
attention collapse. Based on this insight, we propose Believe Your Eyes (BYE),
a data filtering framework that leverages attention entropy patterns as
self-supervised signals to identify and filter backdoor samples. BYE operates
via a three-stage pipeline: (1) extracting attention maps using the fine-tuned
model, (2) computing entropy scores and profiling sensitive layers via bimodal
separation, and (3) performing unsupervised clustering to remove suspicious
samples. Unlike prior defenses, BYE equires no clean supervision, auxiliary
labels, or model modifications. Extensive experiments across various datasets,
models, and diverse trigger types validate BYE's effectiveness: it achieves
near-zero attack success rates while maintaining clean-task performance,
offering a robust and generalizable solution against backdoor threats in MLLMs.

TLDR: 稀疏自编码器（SAE）用于解释大型语言模型（LLM）的内部激活，但现有评估忽略了概念表示对输入扰动的鲁棒性。本文提出鲁棒性量化方法，发现微小扰动即可操纵SAE解释，表明其脆弱性。

Motivation: 现有SAE评估忽视概念表示的鲁棒性，而鲁棒性是概念标签保真度的关键。

Method: 通过输入空间优化问题量化鲁棒性，开发包含对抗性扰动的评估框架。

Result: 微小对抗性扰动可显著操纵SAE概念解释，而不明显影响LLM输出。

Conclusion: SAE概念表示脆弱，可能不适合模型监控和监管应用。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are commonly used to interpret the internal
activations of large language models (LLMs) by mapping them to
human-interpretable concept representations. While existing evaluations of SAEs
focus on metrics such as the reconstruction-sparsity tradeoff, human
(auto-)interpretability, and feature disentanglement, they overlook a critical
aspect: the robustness of concept representations to input perturbations. We
argue that robustness must be a fundamental consideration for concept
representations, reflecting the fidelity of concept labeling. To this end, we
formulate robustness quantification as input-space optimization problems and
develop a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring realistic scenarios in
which adversarial perturbations are crafted to manipulate SAE representations.
Empirically, we find that tiny adversarial input perturbations can effectively
manipulate concept-based interpretations in most scenarios without notably
affecting the outputs of the base LLMs themselves. Overall, our results suggest
that SAE concept representations are fragile and may be ill-suited for
applications in model monitoring and oversight.

Result: 实验表明，Merge to Mix在数据集选择方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Merge to Mix提供了一种高效的数据集混合构建方法，减少了微调需求。

Abstract: Mixing datasets for fine-tuning large models (LMs) has become critical for
maximizing performance on downstream tasks. However, composing effective
dataset mixtures typically relies on heuristics and trial-and-error, often
requiring multiple fine-tuning runs to achieve the desired outcome. We propose
a novel method, $\textit{Merge to Mix}$, that accelerates composing dataset
mixtures through model merging. Model merging is a recent technique that
combines the abilities of multiple individually fine-tuned LMs into a single LM
by using a few simple arithmetic operations. Our key insight is that merging
models individually fine-tuned on each dataset in a mixture can effectively
serve as a surrogate for a model fine-tuned on the entire mixture. Merge to Mix
leverages this insight to accelerate selecting dataset mixtures without
requiring full fine-tuning on each candidate mixture. Our experiments
demonstrate that Merge to Mix surpasses state-of-the-art methods in dataset
selection for fine-tuning LMs.

the merging coefficients, limiting their scalability and generality. In this
work, we revisit model merging through the lens of least-squares optimization
and show that the optimal merging weights should scale with the amount of
task-specific information encoded in each model. Based on this insight, we
propose NAN, a simple yet effective method that estimates model merging
coefficients via the inverse of parameter norm. NAN is training-free,
plug-and-play, and applicable to a wide range of merging strategies. Extensive
experiments on show that NAN consistently improves performance of baseline
methods.

*Zhihang Cai,Xingjun Zhang,Zhendong Tan,Zheng Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: NQKV算法通过量化KV缓存，显著减少内存消耗，提升LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理时KV缓存的内存消耗成为瓶颈，现有量化方法难以进一步降低比特数。

Method: 分析KV缓存的元素分布，设计基于块级分位数量化的NQKV算法。

Result: NQKV使OPT模型推理批次扩大2倍或上下文长度增加4倍，吞吐量提升9.3倍。

Conclusion: NQKV为低比特量化KV缓存提供了高效解决方案，显著提升LLM部署效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across
a wide range of tasks. However, LLMs often require larger batch sizes to
enhance throughput or longer context lengths to meet task demands, which
significantly increases the memory resource consumption of the Key-Value (KV)
cache during inference, becoming a major bottleneck in LLM deployment. To
address this issue, quantization is a common and straightforward approach.
Currently, quantization methods for activations are limited to 8-bit, and
quantization to even lower bits can lead to substantial accuracy drops. To
further save space by quantizing the KV cache to even lower bits, we analyzed
the element distribution of the KV cache and designed the NQKV algorithm. Since
the elements within each block of the KV cache follow a normal distribution,
NQKV employs per-block quantile quantization to achieve
information-theoretically optimal quantization error. Without significantly
compromising model output quality, NQKV enables the OPT model to perform
inference with an 2x larger batch size or a 4x longer context length, and it
improves throughput by 9.3x compared to when the KV cache is not used.

TLDR: AdaSTaR是一种自适应采样算法，通过平衡训练数据和动态调整难度，显著提升语言模型的性能和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机采样方法导致训练数据不平衡，过度训练简单样本而忽略困难样本。

Method: AdaSTaR结合两种自适应采样原则：多样性采样和课程采样，动态调整数据分布。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，AdaSTaR均取得最佳测试准确率，并减少58.6%的训练计算量。

Conclusion: AdaSTaR为自改进语言模型提供了更高效和有效的训练方法。

Abstract: Self-Taught Reasoners (STaR), synonymously known as Rejection sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT), is an integral part of the training pipeline of
self-improving reasoning Language Models (LMs). The self-improving mechanism
often employs random observation (data) sampling. However, this results in
trained observation imbalance; inefficiently over-training on solved examples
while under-training on challenging ones. In response, we introduce Adaptive
STaR (AdaSTaR), a novel algorithm that rectifies this by integrating two
adaptive sampling principles: (1) Adaptive Sampling for Diversity: promoting
balanced training across observations, and (2) Adaptive Sampling for
Curriculum: dynamically adjusting data difficulty to match the model's evolving
strength. Across six benchmarks, AdaSTaR achieves best test accuracy in all
instances (6/6) and reduces training FLOPs by an average of 58.6% against an
extensive list of baselines. These improvements in performance and efficiency
generalize to different pre-trained LMs and larger models, paving the way for
more efficient and effective self-improving LMs.

TLDR: 论文探讨了大规模强化学习（RL）如何显著提升中小型模型的推理能力，超越蒸馏方法的效果。通过数学和代码提示的分阶段训练，以及数据筛选和验证，实现了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大规模RL在推理任务中取得进展，但训练高表现模型的细节常被忽略，且蒸馏方法在小模型中更有效。本文旨在证明RL能显著提升中小型模型的推理能力。

Method: 分阶段RL训练：先数学提示，后代码提示。开发数据筛选流程，收集高质量提示和测试用例，支持验证式RL。

Result: 数学RL显著提升数学和代码任务表现（如AIME 2025提升14.6%/17.2%）。代码RL进一步优化代码任务，数学表现几乎不受影响。

Conclusion: RL不仅能激发预训练和监督微调获得的推理能力，还能突破模型极限，解决此前无法解决的问题。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for
reasoning, the training recipe for building high-performing reasoning models
remains elusive. Key implementation details of frontier models, such as
DeepSeek-R1, including data curation strategies and RL training recipe, are
often omitted. Moreover, recent research indicates distillation remains more
effective than RL for smaller models. In this work, we demonstrate that
large-scale RL can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of strong,
small- and mid-sized models, achieving results that surpass those of
state-of-the-art distillation-based models. We systematically study the RL
training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective
approach: first training on math-only prompts, then on code-only prompts.
Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the
performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks (e.g., +14.6% /
+17.2% on AIME 2025 for the 7B / 14B models), but also code reasoning tasks
(e.g., +6.8% / +5.8% on LiveCodeBench for the 7B / 14B models). In addition,
extended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks
with minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data
curation pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable
answers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains.
Finally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning
with progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of
on-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational
reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning
(e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning
ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: MoRE-Brain提出了一种基于大脑网络原理的混合专家框架，用于高保真、可适应且可解释的视觉重建，通过动态路由机制和扩散模型实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前fMRI视觉解码研究过于关注重建保真度而忽视可解释性，限制了神经科学洞察的获取。

Method: 采用分层混合专家架构，专家网络处理功能相关体素组，结合CLIP空间编码和双阶段路由机制的扩散模型。

Result: 实验验证了高重建保真度，有效利用fMRI信号，提供神经解码的机制性洞察。

Conclusion: MoRE-Brain在可泛化和可解释的fMRI视觉解码方面取得显著进展。

Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from fMRI offers a powerful avenue to understand
human perception and develop advanced brain-computer interfaces. However,
current progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while
overlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific
insight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework
designed for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction.
MoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture
where distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel
groups, mimicking specialized brain networks. The experts are first trained to
encode fMRI into the frozen CLIP space. A finetuned diffusion model then
synthesizes images, guided by expert outputs through a novel dual-stage routing
mechanism that dynamically weighs expert contributions across the diffusion
process. MoRE-Brain offers three main advancements: First, it introduces a
novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture grounded in brain network principles for
neuro-decoding. Second, it achieves efficient cross-subject generalization by
sharing core expert networks while adapting only subject-specific routers.
Third, it provides enhanced mechanistic insight, as the explicit routing
reveals precisely how different modeled brain regions shape the semantic and
spatial attributes of the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments validate
MoRE-Brain's high reconstruction fidelity, with bottleneck analyses further
demonstrating its effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine
neural decoding from over-reliance on generative priors. Consequently,
MoRE-Brain marks a substantial advance towards more generalizable and
interpretable fMRI-based visual decoding. Code will be publicly available soon:

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文探讨了微调大型语言模型（LLM）时安全性能下降的问题，并提出了一种安全感知探测（SAP）优化框架，以在保持任务性能的同时减少有害内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练阶段采用了安全对齐技术，但研究发现微调LLM时即使使用无害数据仍可能导致安全性能下降，因此需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SAP框架，通过在梯度传播过程中加入安全感知探测，识别潜在风险方向，从而减少安全性能下降。

Result: 实验表明，SAP能有效降低有害内容生成，同时保持与标准微调方法相当的测试损失。

Conclusion: SAP是一种有效的框架，可在微调LLM时兼顾任务性能与安全性。

Abstract: The significant progress of large language models (LLMs) has led to
remarkable achievements across numerous applications. However, their ability to
generate harmful content has sparked substantial safety concerns. Despite the
implementation of safety alignment techniques during the pre-training phase,
recent research indicates that fine-tuning LLMs on adversarial or even benign
data can inadvertently compromise their safety. In this paper, we re-examine
the fundamental issue of why fine-tuning on non-harmful data still results in
safety degradation. We introduce a safety-aware probing (SAP) optimization
framework designed to mitigate the safety risks of fine-tuning LLMs.
Specifically, SAP incorporates a safety-aware probe into the gradient
propagation process, mitigating the model's risk of safety degradation by
identifying potential pitfalls in gradient directions, thereby enhancing
task-specific performance while successfully preserving model safety. Our
extensive experimental results demonstrate that SAP effectively reduces
harmfulness below the original fine-tuned model and achieves comparable test
loss to standard fine-tuning methods. Our code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法在性能上不一致，GradPCA旨在通过梯度PCA和NTK对齐提供更稳定的解决方案。

Method: 对梯度类均值应用PCA，结合NTK对齐的理论支持，分析特征空间性质。

Result: GradPCA在标准图像分类基准上表现优异，特征质量（如预训练表示）对检测效果至关重要。

Conclusion: GradPCA性能优越，理论框架为设计更合理的谱OOD检测器提供指导。

Abstract: We introduce GradPCA, an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection method that
exploits the low-rank structure of neural network gradients induced by Neural
Tangent Kernel (NTK) alignment. GradPCA applies Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) to gradient class-means, achieving more consistent performance than
existing methods across standard image classification benchmarks. We provide a
theoretical perspective on spectral OOD detection in neural networks to support
GradPCA, highlighting feature-space properties that enable effective detection
and naturally emerge from NTK alignment. Our analysis further reveals that
feature quality -- particularly the use of pretrained versus non-pretrained
representations -- plays a crucial role in determining which detectors will
succeed. Extensive experiments validate the strong performance of GradPCA, and
our theoretical framework offers guidance for designing more principled
spectral OOD detectors.

Result: 在适应性和信任方面进行了基准测试，推理方面提供了文献驱动的见解，为联邦学习的系统评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: ATR-Bench为联邦学习的全面评估提供了框架，并计划公开代码和持续更新的资源库。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data privacy across decentralized participants.
As FL adoption grows, numerous techniques have been proposed to tackle its
practical challenges. However, the lack of standardized evaluation across key
dimensions hampers systematic progress and fair comparison of FL methods. In
this work, we introduce ATR-Bench, a unified framework for analyzing federated
learning through three foundational dimensions: Adaptation, Trust, and
Reasoning. We provide an in-depth examination of the conceptual foundations,
task formulations, and open research challenges associated with each theme. We
have extensively benchmarked representative methods and datasets for adaptation
to heterogeneous clients and trustworthiness in adversarial or unreliable
environments. Due to the lack of reliable metrics and models for reasoning in
FL, we only provide literature-driven insights for this dimension. ATR-Bench
lays the groundwork for a systematic and holistic evaluation of federated
learning with real-world relevance. We will make our complete codebase publicly
accessible and a curated repository that continuously tracks new developments
and research in the FL literature.

TLDR: Polar Express是一种GPU友好的算法，用于计算极分解，适用于深度学习中的Muon优化框架，具有快速收敛和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值分析方法在深度学习中效率不足，需要一种高效且GPU兼容的算法。

Method: Polar Express通过解决极小极大优化问题，动态调整多项式更新规则，仅使用矩阵乘法。

Result: 在Muon框架中应用Polar Express，显著提升了GPT-2等大规模模型的验证损失表现。

Conclusion: Polar Express在深度学习中表现优异，优于现有方法，尤其在GPU环境下。

Abstract: Computing the polar decomposition and the related matrix sign function, has
been a well-studied problem in numerical analysis for decades. More recently,
it has emerged as an important subroutine in deep learning, particularly within
the Muon optimization framework. However, the requirements in this setting
differ significantly from those of traditional numerical analysis. In deep
learning, methods must be highly efficient and GPU-compatible, but high
accuracy is often unnecessary. As a result, classical algorithms like
Newton-Schulz (which suffers from slow initial convergence) and methods based
on rational functions (which rely on QR decompositions or matrix inverses) are
poorly suited to this context. In this work, we introduce Polar Express, a
GPU-friendly algorithm for computing the polar decomposition. Like classical
polynomial methods such as Newton-Schulz, our approach uses only matrix-matrix
multiplications, making it GPU-compatible. Motivated by earlier work of Chen &
Chow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the polynomial update rule
at each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem, and we prove that
it enjoys a strong worst-case optimality guarantee. This property ensures both
rapid early convergence and fast asymptotic convergence. We also address
finite-precision issues, making it stable in bfloat16 in practice. We apply
Polar Express within the Muon optimization framework and show consistent
improvements in validation loss on large-scale models such as GPT-2,
outperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates.

Result: LLaDA-V在多模态任务中表现优异，缩小了与Qwen2-VL的性能差距，并在多模态理解上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在多模态任务中具有潜力，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce LLaDA-V, a purely diffusion-based Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) that integrates visual instruction tuning with masked
diffusion models, representing a departure from the autoregressive paradigms
dominant in current multimodal approaches. Built upon LLaDA, a representative
large language diffusion model, LLaDA-V incorporates a vision encoder and MLP
connector that projects visual features into the language embedding space,
enabling effective multimodal alignment. Our empirical investigation reveals
several intriguing results: First, LLaDA-V demonstrates promising multimodal
performance despite its language model being weaker on purely textual tasks
than counterparts like LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B. When trained on the same
instruction data, LLaDA-V is highly competitive to LLaMA3-V across multimodal
tasks with better data scalability. It also narrows the performance gap to
Qwen2-VL, suggesting the effectiveness of its architecture for multimodal
tasks. Second, LLaDA-V achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal
understanding compared to existing hybrid autoregressive-diffusion and purely
diffusion-based MLLMs. Our findings suggest that large language diffusion
models show promise in multimodal contexts and warrant further investigation in
future research. Project page and codes:

Method: 提出UFT范式，将SFT和RFT结合为一个统一过程，使模型能有效探索解决方案并整合监督信号。

Result: UFT在各类模型规模上均优于SFT和RFT，并理论上突破了RFT的指数样本复杂度瓶颈。

Conclusion: UFT是一种高效的后训练方法，显著提升了模型的推理能力，尤其在长程推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Post-training has demonstrated its importance in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The primary post-training methods
can be categorized into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT is efficient and well-suited for small language models,
but it may lead to overfitting and limit the reasoning abilities of larger
models. In contrast, RFT generally yields better generalization but depends
heavily on the strength of the base model. To address the limitations of SFT
and RFT, we propose Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), a novel post-training paradigm
that unifies SFT and RFT into a single, integrated process. UFT enables the
model to effectively explore solutions while incorporating informative
supervision signals, bridging the gap between memorizing and thinking
underlying existing methods. Notably, UFT outperforms both SFT and RFT in
general, regardless of model sizes. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that
UFT breaks RFT's inherent exponential sample complexity bottleneck, showing for
the first time that unified training can exponentially accelerate convergence
on long-horizon reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Datasets in engineering domains are often small, sparsely labeled, and
contain numerical as well as categorical conditions. Additionally.
computational resources are typically limited in practical applications which
hinders the adoption of generative models for engineering tasks. We introduce a
novel masked-conditioning approach, that enables generative models to work with
sparse, mixed-type data. We mask conditions during training to simulate sparse
conditions at inference time. For this purpose, we explore the use of various
sparsity schedules that show different strengths and weaknesses. In addition,
we introduce a flexible embedding that deals with categorical as well as
numerical conditions. We integrate our method into an efficient variational
autoencoder as well as a latent diffusion model and demonstrate the
applicability of our approach on two engineering-related datasets of 2D point
clouds and images. Finally, we show that small models trained on limited data
can be coupled with large pretrained foundation models to improve generation
quality while retaining the controllability induced by our conditioning scheme.

Result: 揭示了在最小化副作用与保持对抗提示鲁棒性之间的张力。

Conclusion: 强调了在扩散模型中进行全面概念擦除评估的重要性。

Abstract: Concept erasure, the ability to selectively prevent a model from generating
specific concepts, has attracted growing interest, with various approaches
emerging to address the challenge. However, it remains unclear how thoroughly
these methods erase the target concept. We begin by proposing two conceptual
models for the erasure mechanism in diffusion models: (i) reducing the
likelihood of generating the target concept, and (ii) interfering with the
model's internal guidance mechanisms. To thoroughly assess whether a concept
has been truly erased from the model, we introduce a suite of independent
evaluations. Our evaluation framework includes adversarial attacks, novel
probing techniques, and analysis of the model's alternative generations in
place of the erased concept. Our results shed light on the tension between
minimizing side effects and maintaining robustness to adversarial prompts.
Broadly, our work underlines the importance of comprehensive evaluation for
erasure in diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce RIPT-VLA, a simple and scalable reinforcement-learning-based
interactive post-training paradigm that fine-tunes pretrained
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using only sparse binary success rewards.
Existing VLA training pipelines rely heavily on offline expert demonstration
data and supervised imitation, limiting their ability to adapt to new tasks and
environments under low-data regimes. RIPT-VLA addresses this by enabling
interactive post-training with a stable policy optimization algorithm based on
dynamic rollout sampling and leave-one-out advantage estimation.
  RIPT-VLA has the following characteristics. First, it applies to various VLA
models, resulting in an improvement on the lightweight QueST model by 21.2%,
and the 7B OpenVLA-OFT model to an unprecedented 97.5% success rate. Second, it
is computationally efficient and data-efficient: with only one demonstration,
RIPT-VLA enables an unworkable SFT model (4%) to succeed with a 97% success
rate within 15 iterations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the policy learned
by RIPT-VLA generalizes across different tasks and scenarios and is robust to
the initial state context. These results highlight RIPT-VLA as a practical and
effective paradigm for post-training VLA models through minimal supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多种软件工程任务中表现优异，但功能驱动开发（FDD）这一实际任务仍未被充分探索。

Method: 构建了包含14,000训练和500测试样本的SWE-Dev数据集，提供可运行环境和开发者编写的单元测试，支持监督微调和强化学习。

Result: 评估显示FDD对当前AI极具挑战性（如Claude-3.7-Sonnet在困难测试集上仅22.45%通过率），但微调后7B模型表现接近GPT-4o。

Conclusion: SWE-Dev是改进模型的有效平台，其高质量数据对提升AI在功能开发任务中的表现具有重要价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capability in diverse software
engineering tasks, e.g. code completion, bug fixing, and document generation.
However, feature-driven development (FDD), a highly prevalent real-world task
that involves developing new functionalities for large, existing codebases,
remains underexplored. We therefore introduce SWE-Dev, the first large-scale
dataset (with 14,000 training and 500 test samples) designed to evaluate and
train autonomous coding systems on real-world feature development tasks. To
ensure verifiable and diverse training, SWE-Dev uniquely provides all instances
with a runnable environment and its developer-authored executable unit tests.
This collection not only provides high-quality data for Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), but also enables Reinforcement Learning (RL) by delivering accurate
reward signals from executable unit tests. Our extensive evaluations on
SWE-Dev, covering 17 chatbot LLMs, 10 reasoning models, and 10 Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS), reveal that FDD is a profoundly challenging frontier for current
AI (e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves only 22.45\% Pass@3 on the hard test
split). Crucially, we demonstrate that SWE-Dev serves as an effective platform
for model improvement: fine-tuning on training set enabled a 7B model
comparable to GPT-4o on \textit{hard} split, underscoring the value of its
high-quality training data. Code is available here

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are evolving into language-interactive
platforms, enabling more intuitive forms of human-drone interaction. While
prior works have primarily focused on high-level planning and long-horizon
navigation, we shift attention to language-guided fine-grained trajectory
control, where UAVs execute short-range, reactive flight behaviors in response
to language instructions. We formalize this problem as the Flying-on-a-Word
(Flow) task and introduce UAV imitation learning as an effective approach. In
this framework, UAVs learn fine-grained control policies by mimicking expert
pilot trajectories paired with atomic language instructions. To support this
paradigm, we present UAV-Flow, the first real-world benchmark for
language-conditioned, fine-grained UAV control. It includes a task formulation,
a large-scale dataset collected in diverse environments, a deployable control
framework, and a simulation suite for systematic evaluation. Our design enables
UAVs to closely imitate the precise, expert-level flight trajectories of human
pilots and supports direct deployment without sim-to-real gap. We conduct
extensive experiments on UAV-Flow, benchmarking VLN and VLA paradigms. Results
show that VLA models are superior to VLN baselines and highlight the critical
role of spatial grounding in the fine-grained Flow setting.

TLDR: VERDI框架通过将视觉语言模型的推理能力蒸馏到自动驾驶堆栈中，解决了现有方法的高计算成本和安全性问题。


<details>

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在部分可观测性和复杂现实环境中的决策能力不足，而人类驾驶员能通过常识推理做出高效决策。现有基于视觉语言模型的方法虽有效，但计算成本高且难以分解安全性。

Method: VERDI在训练时将视觉语言模型的推理过程和常识知识蒸馏到模块化自动驾驶模型中，通过中间模块输出与文本特征对齐实现推理能力内化。

Result: 在NuScenes数据集上，VERDI在保持高推理速度的同时，性能优于未嵌入推理的端到端方法10%（ℓ2距离）。

Conclusion: VERDI为自动驾驶系统提供了一种高效且安全的推理能力嵌入方法，避免了大型视觉语言模型的高计算成本。

Abstract: While autonomous driving (AD) stacks struggle with decision making under
partial observability and real-world complexity, human drivers are capable of
commonsense reasoning to make near-optimal decisions with limited information.
Recent work has attempted to leverage finetuned Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
for trajectory planning at inference time to emulate human behavior. Despite
their success in benchmark evaluations, these methods are often impractical to
deploy (a 70B parameter VLM inference at merely 8 tokens per second requires
more than 160G of memory), and their monolithic network structure prohibits
safety decomposition. To bridge this gap, we propose VLM-Embedded Reasoning for
autonomous Driving (VERDI), a training-time framework that distills the
reasoning process and commonsense knowledge of VLMs into the AD stack. VERDI
augments modular differentiable end-to-end (e2e) AD models by aligning
intermediate module outputs at the perception, prediction, and planning stages
with text features explaining the driving reasoning process produced by VLMs.
By encouraging alignment in latent space, \textsc{VERDI} enables the modular AD
stack to internalize structured reasoning, without incurring the inference-time
costs of large VLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the
NuScenes dataset and find that VERDI outperforms existing e2e methods that do
not embed reasoning by 10% in $\ell_{2}$ distance, while maintaining high
inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在机器人操作中存在空间理解和语义抽象不足的问题，3D点云模型缺乏语义抽象，2D图像编码器难以进行空间推理。

Method: SEM框架结合了空间增强器和机器人状态编码器，前者通过3D几何上下文增强视觉表示，后者通过基于图的关节依赖建模捕捉机器人状态。

Result: SEM在多种任务中表现出色，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SEM通过增强空间理解和机器人状态编码，为机器人操作提供了更鲁棒和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: A key challenge in robot manipulation lies in developing policy models with
strong spatial understanding, the ability to reason about 3D geometry, object
relations, and robot embodiment. Existing methods often fall short: 3D point
cloud models lack semantic abstraction, while 2D image encoders struggle with
spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose SEM (Spatial Enhanced
Manipulation model), a novel diffusion-based policy framework that explicitly
enhances spatial understanding from two complementary perspectives. A spatial
enhancer augments visual representations with 3D geometric context, while a
robot state encoder captures embodiment-aware structure through graphbased
modeling of joint dependencies. By integrating these modules, SEM significantly
improves spatial understanding, leading to robust and generalizable
manipulation across diverse tasks that outperform existing baselines.

TLDR: Raw2Drive是一种基于双流模型强化学习的方法，填补了在端到端自动驾驶中使用原始传感器数据的空白，并在CARLA Leaderboard 2.0上取得了领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习存在因果混淆和分布偏移问题，而强化学习在端到端自动驾驶中训练困难。现有的基于模型的强化学习方法通常需要特权信息而非原始传感器数据。

Method: 设计了Raw2Drive，通过训练特权世界模型和原始传感器世界模型，并利用Guidance Mechanism确保两者一致性，最终结合特权模型的先验知识指导原始传感器策略的训练。

Result: Raw2Drive是CARLA Leaderboard 2.0上唯一基于强化学习的端到端方法，并实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Raw2Drive成功解决了原始传感器数据在端到端自动驾驶中的应用问题，展示了强化学习在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) can mitigate the causal confusion and
distribution shift inherent to imitation learning (IL). However, applying RL to
end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) remains an open problem for its training
difficulty, and IL is still the mainstream paradigm in both academia and
industry. Recently Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) have demonstrated
promising results in neural planning; however, these methods typically require
privileged information as input rather than raw sensor data. We fill this gap
by designing Raw2Drive, a dual-stream MBRL approach. Initially, we efficiently
train an auxiliary privileged world model paired with a neural planner that
uses privileged information as input. Subsequently, we introduce a raw sensor
world model trained via our proposed Guidance Mechanism, which ensures
consistency between the raw sensor world model and the privileged world model
during rollouts. Finally, the raw sensor world model combines the prior
knowledge embedded in the heads of the privileged world model to effectively
guide the training of the raw sensor policy. Raw2Drive is so far the only RL
based end-to-end method on CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, and Bench2Drive and it
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 增强模型对物理交互的系统性推理能力，减少对标注数据的依赖。

Conclusion: ManipLVM-R1在提升泛化能力和适应性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently advanced robotic
manipulation by leveraging vision for scene perception and language for
instruction following. However, existing methods rely heavily on costly
human-annotated training datasets, which limits their generalization and causes
them to struggle in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios, reducing real-world
adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose ManipLVM-R1, a novel
reinforcement learning framework that replaces traditional supervision with
Reinforcement Learning using Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). By directly optimizing
for task-aligned outcomes, our method enhances generalization and physical
reasoning while removing the dependence on costly annotations. Specifically, we
design two rule-based reward functions targeting key robotic manipulation
subtasks: an Affordance Perception Reward to enhance localization of
interaction regions, and a Trajectory Match Reward to ensure the physical
plausibility of action paths. These rewards provide immediate feedback and
impose spatial-logical constraints, encouraging the model to go beyond shallow
pattern matching and instead learn deeper, more systematic reasoning about
physical interactions.

Motivation: 当前电影配音技术虽能实现语音与视频的完美同步和情感表达，但在配音风格多样性、对话处理及细节（如说话者年龄和性别）方面仍有不足。

Method: 采用多模态大视觉语言模型（VLM）分析视觉输入，识别配音类型和细节属性；利用大语音生成模型生成高质量配音；构建带标注的电影配音数据集以提升模型表现。

Conclusion: 多模态框架显著提升了电影配音的质量和适应性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Current movie dubbing technology can produce the desired speech using a
reference voice and input video, maintaining perfect synchronization with the
visuals while effectively conveying the intended emotions. However, crucial
aspects of movie dubbing, including adaptation to various dubbing styles,
effective handling of dialogue, narration, and monologues, as well as
consideration of subtle details such as speaker age and gender, remain
insufficiently explored. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a multi-modal
generative framework. First, it utilizes a multi-modal large vision-language
model (VLM) to analyze visual inputs, enabling the recognition of dubbing types
and fine-grained attributes. Second, it produces high-quality dubbing using
large speech generation models, guided by multi-modal inputs. Additionally, a
movie dubbing dataset with annotations for dubbing types and subtle details is
constructed to enhance movie understanding and improve dubbing quality for the
proposed multi-modal framework. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
In details, the LSE-D, SPK-SIM, EMO-SIM, and MCD exhibit improvements of up to
1.09%, 8.80%, 19.08%, and 18.74%, respectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种基于因果端到端框架的LLM路由方法，通过最小化决策遗憾从观测数据中学习路由策略，避免了传统方法的复合误差和高成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM路由方法采用解耦策略，容易产生复合误差且依赖高成本的完整反馈数据。论文旨在通过观测数据学习路由策略，解决这些问题。

Method: 提出因果端到端框架，引入两种理论基础的替代目标（分类上界和softmax加权遗憾近似），并通过区间条件架构处理异构成本偏好。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，该方法优于现有基线，实现了不同嵌入模型上的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出的框架能够高效地从观测数据中学习路由策略，显著提升性能并降低成本。

Abstract: LLM routing aims to select the most appropriate model for each query,
balancing competing performance metrics such as accuracy and cost across a pool
of language models. Prior approaches typically adopt a decoupled strategy,
where the metrics are first predicted and the model is then selected based on
these estimates. This setup is prone to compounding errors and often relies on
full-feedback data, where each query is evaluated by all candidate models,
which is costly to obtain and maintain in practice. In contrast, we learn from
observational data, which records only the outcome of the model actually
deployed. We propose a causal end-to-end framework that learns routing policies
by minimizing decision-making regret from observational data. To enable
efficient optimization, we introduce two theoretically grounded surrogate
objectives: a classification-based upper bound, and a softmax-weighted regret
approximation shown to recover the optimal policy at convergence. We further
extend our framework to handle heterogeneous cost preferences via an
interval-conditioned architecture. Experiments on public benchmarks show that
our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across different embedding models.

Abstract: We have seen remarkable progress in large language models (LLMs) empowered

experts with diverse skills. However, optimizing LLM-based multi-agent systems
remains challenging. In this work, we perform an empirical case study on group
optimization of role-based multi-agent systems utilizing natural language
feedback for challenging software development tasks under various evaluation
dimensions. We propose a two-step agent prompts optimization pipeline:
identifying underperforming agents with their failure explanations utilizing
textual feedback and then optimizing system prompts of identified agents
utilizing failure explanations. We then study the impact of various
optimization settings on system performance with two comparison groups: online
against offline optimization and individual against group optimization. For
group optimization, we study two prompting strategies: one-pass and multi-pass
prompting optimizations. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
optimization method for role-based multi-agent systems tackling software
development tasks evaluated on diverse evaluation dimensions, and we
investigate the impact of diverse optimization settings on group behaviors of
the multi-agent systems to provide practical insights for future development.

Abstract: As of 2025, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has become a central
tool for productivity across industries. Beyond text generation, GenAI now
plays a critical role in coding, data analysis, and research workflows. As
large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is essential to assess the
reliability and accuracy of their outputs, especially in specialized,
high-stakes domains like finance. Most modern LLMs transform text into
numerical vectors, which are used in operations such as cosine similarity
searches to generate responses. However, this abstraction process can lead to
misinterpretation of emotional tone, particularly in nuanced financial
contexts. While LLMs generally excel at identifying sentiment in everyday
language, these models often struggle with the nuanced, strategically ambiguous
language found in earnings call transcripts. Financial disclosures frequently
embed sentiment in hedged statements, forward-looking language, and
industry-specific jargon, making it difficult even for human analysts to
interpret consistently, let alone AI models. This paper presents findings from
the Santa Clara Microsoft Practicum Project, led by Professor Charlie
Goldenberg, which benchmarks the performance of Microsoft's Copilot, OpenAI's
ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and traditional machine learning models for sentiment
analysis of financial text. Using Microsoft earnings call transcripts, the
analysis assesses how well LLM-derived sentiment correlates with market
sentiment and stock movements and evaluates the accuracy of model outputs.
Prompt engineering techniques are also examined to improve sentiment analysis
results. Visualizations of sentiment consistency are developed to evaluate
alignment between tone and stock performance, with sentiment trends analyzed
across Microsoft's lines of business to determine which segments exert the
greatest influence.

Abstract: Validating scientific hypotheses is a central challenge in biomedical
research, and remains difficult for artificial intelligence (AI) agents due to
the complexity of real-world data analysis and evidence interpretation. In this
work, we present BioDSA-1K, a benchmark designed to evaluate AI agents on
realistic, data-driven biomedical hypothesis validation tasks. BioDSA-1K
consists of 1,029 hypothesis-centric tasks paired with 1,177 analysis plans,
curated from over 300 published biomedical studies to reflect the structure and
reasoning found in authentic research workflows. Each task includes a
structured hypothesis derived from the original study's conclusions, expressed
in the affirmative to reflect the language of scientific reporting, and one or
more pieces of supporting evidence grounded in empirical data tables. While
these hypotheses mirror published claims, they remain testable using standard
statistical or machine learning methods. The benchmark enables evaluation along
four axes: (1) hypothesis decision accuracy, (2) alignment between evidence and
conclusion, (3) correctness of the reasoning process, and (4) executability of
the AI-generated analysis code. Importantly, BioDSA-1K includes non-verifiable
hypotheses: cases where the available data are insufficient to support or
refute a claim, reflecting a common yet underexplored scenario in real-world
science. We propose BioDSA-1K as a foundation for building and evaluating
generalizable, trustworthy AI agents for biomedical discovery.

TLDR: SAI-DPO算法通过动态评估模型在不同训练阶段的能力，自适应地选择训练数据，显著提升了推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法依赖静态指标，无法适应动态训练过程，限制了模型能力的提升。

Method: SAI-DPO通过实时反馈模型性能，动态调整数据选择策略，以适应模型能力的演变。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，SAI-DPO平均提升21.3个百分点，尤其在AIME24和AMC23上表现突出。

Conclusion: 动态、模型自适应的数据选择策略优于静态方法，能有效提升推理任务的性能。

Abstract: In the realm of data selection for reasoning tasks, existing approaches
predominantly rely on externally predefined static metrics such as difficulty
and diversity, which are often designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
lack adaptability to continuous training processes. A critical limitation of
these methods is their inability to dynamically align with the evolving
capabilities of models during online training, a gap that becomes increasingly
pronounced with the rise of dynamic training paradigms and online reinforcement
learning (RL) frameworks (e.g., R1 models). To address this, we introduce
SAI-DPO, an algorithm that dynamically selects training data by continuously
assessing a model's stage-specific reasoning abilities across different
training phases. By integrating real-time model performance feedback, SAI-DPO
adaptively adapts data selection to the evolving strengths and weaknesses of
the model, thus enhancing both data utilization efficiency and final task
performance. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art models and eight
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including challenging competition-level
datasets (e.g., AIME24 and AMC23), demonstrate that SAI-DPO achieves an average
performance boost of up to 21.3 percentage points, with particularly notable
improvements of 10 and 15 points on AIME24 and AMC23, respectively. These
results highlight the superiority of dynamic, model-adaptive data selection
over static, externally defined strategies in advancing reasoning.

Result: 实验表明，SafeKey显著提升了对越狱攻击和有害提示的安全性，平均有害率降低9.6%，同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: SafeKey通过重塑内部注意力和提升隐藏表示质量，有效增强了模型的安全性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) introduce a new generation paradigm of
explicitly reasoning before answering, leading to remarkable improvements in
complex tasks. However, they pose great safety risks against harmful queries
and adversarial attacks. While recent mainstream safety efforts on LRMs,
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), improve safety performance, we find that
SFT-aligned models struggle to generalize to unseen jailbreak prompts. After
thorough investigation of LRMs' generation, we identify a safety aha moment
that can activate safety reasoning and lead to a safe response. This aha moment
typically appears in the `key sentence', which follows models' query
understanding process and can indicate whether the model will proceed safely.
Based on these insights, we propose SafeKey, including two complementary
objectives to better activate the safety aha moment in the key sentence: (1) a
Dual-Path Safety Head to enhance the safety signal in the model's internal
representations before the key sentence, and (2) a Query-Mask Modeling
objective to improve the models' attention on its query understanding, which
has important safety hints. Experiments across multiple safety benchmarks
demonstrate that our methods significantly improve safety generalization to a
wide range of jailbreak attacks and out-of-distribution harmful prompts,
lowering the average harmfulness rate by 9.6\%, while maintaining general
abilities. Our analysis reveals how SafeKey enhances safety by reshaping
internal attention and improving the quality of hidden representations.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识图谱工程（KGE）任务中的性能与资源成本的平衡，以优化模型选择。

Method: 使用LLM-KG-Bench框架评估26个开源LLMs，分析模型规模与性能的关系，包括同家族模型的比较。

Result: 模型规模扩展定律在多数KGE任务中适用，但存在性能平台效应；某些情况下，较小模型更具成本效益。

Conclusion: 建议在选择模型时测试同家族不同规模的模型，以平衡性能与成本。

Abstract: When using Large Language Models (LLMs) to support Knowledge Graph
Engineering (KGE), one of the first indications when searching for an
appropriate model is its size. According to the scaling laws, larger models
typically show higher capabilities. However, in practice, resource costs are
also an important factor and thus it makes sense to consider the ratio between
model performance and costs. The LLM-KG-Bench framework enables the comparison
of LLMs in the context of KGE tasks and assesses their capabilities of
understanding and producing KGs and KG queries. Based on a dataset created in
an LLM-KG-Bench run covering 26 open state-of-the-art LLMs, we explore the
model size scaling laws specific to KGE tasks. In our analyses, we assess how
benchmark scores evolve between different model size categories. Additionally,
we inspect how the general score development of single models and families of
models correlates to their size. Our analyses revealed that, with a few
exceptions, the model size scaling laws generally also apply to the selected
KGE tasks. However, in some cases, plateau or ceiling effects occurred, i.e.,
the task performance did not change much between a model and the next larger
model. In these cases, smaller models could be considered to achieve high
cost-effectiveness. Regarding models of the same family, sometimes larger
models performed worse than smaller models of the same family. These effects
occurred only locally. Hence it is advisable to additionally test the next
smallest and largest model of the same family.

Conclusion: ACPO实现了高效的混合推理，为大型推理模型提供了优化方向。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, but often suffer from overthinking, generating redundant
content regardless of task difficulty. Inspired by the dual process theory in
cognitive science, we propose Adaptive Cognition Policy Optimization (ACPO), a
reinforcement learning framework that enables LRMs to achieve efficient
reasoning through adaptive cognitive allocation and dynamic system switch. ACPO
incorporates two key components: (1) introducing system-aware reasoning tokens
to explicitly represent the thinking modes thereby making the model's cognitive
process transparent, and (2) integrating online difficulty estimation and token
length budget to guide adaptive system switch and reasoning during
reinforcement learning. To this end, we propose a two-stage training strategy.
The first stage begins with supervised fine-tuning to cold start the model,
enabling it to generate reasoning paths with explicit thinking modes. In the
second stage, we apply ACPO to further enhance adaptive system switch for
difficulty-aware reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that ACPO
effectively reduces redundant reasoning while adaptively adjusting cognitive
allocation based on task complexity, achieving efficient hybrid reasoning.

Result: 人类准确率高达98.0%（困难谜题为94.5%），而最佳模型（如o4-mini）仅15.8%（困难谜题为1.1%），且常生成无效路径。

Conclusion: SPaRC揭示了模型在空间推理上的局限性，未来可通过改进训练和测试时计算效率提升表现。

Abstract: Existing reasoning datasets saturate and fail to test abstract, multi-step
problems, especially pathfinding and complex rule constraint satisfaction. We
introduce SPaRC (Spatial Pathfinding Reasoning Challenge), a dataset of 1,000
2D grid pathfinding puzzles to evaluate spatial and symbolic reasoning,
requiring step-by-step planning with arithmetic and geometric rules. Humans
achieve near-perfect accuracy (98.0%; 94.5% on hard puzzles), while the best
reasoning models, such as o4-mini, struggle (15.8%; 1.1% on hard puzzles).
Models often generate invalid paths (>50% of puzzles for o4-mini), and
reasoning tokens reveal they make errors in navigation and spatial logic.
Unlike humans, who take longer on hard puzzles, models fail to scale test-time
compute with difficulty. Allowing models to make multiple solution attempts
improves accuracy, suggesting potential for better spatial reasoning with
improved training and efficient test-time scaling methods. SPaRC can be used as
a window into models' spatial reasoning limitations and drive research toward
new methods that excel in abstract, multi-step problem-solving.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为KTAE的新算法，通过细粒度的token级优势估计，解决了现有强化学习算法在计算优势时的粗粒度问题，显著提升了模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习算法（如GRPO及其变体DAPO）在计算优势时存在粗粒度问题，无法捕捉token级贡献，限制了模型的学习效果。

Method: 提出KTAE算法，利用采样rollout的正确性和统计分析，量化token级重要性，结合rollout级优势，实现细粒度token级优势估计。

Result: 实验表明，GRPO+KTAE和DAPO+KTAE在五个数学推理基准上优于基线方法，且能以更短的响应达到更高准确率。

Conclusion: KTAE算法有效解决了现有强化学习算法的粗粒度问题，显著提升了模型的推理能力，尤其在数学推理任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated that integrating reinforcement learning
with rule-based rewards can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, even without supervised fine-tuning. However, prevalent
reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO and its variants like DAPO,
suffer from a coarse granularity issue when computing the advantage.
Specifically, they compute rollout-level advantages that assign identical
values to every token within a sequence, failing to capture token-specific
contributions and hindering effective learning. To address this limitation, we
propose Key-token Advantage Estimation (KTAE) - a novel algorithm that
estimates fine-grained, token-level advantages without introducing additional
models. KTAE leverages the correctness of sampled rollouts and applies
statistical analysis to quantify the importance of individual tokens within a
sequence to the final outcome. This quantified token-level importance is then
combined with the rollout-level advantage to obtain a more fine-grained
token-level advantage estimation. Empirical results show that models trained
with GRPO+KTAE and DAPO+KTAE outperform baseline methods across five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Notably, they achieve higher accuracy with
shorter responses and even surpass R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B using the same base
model.

Motivation: 现有基础模型在生成教育有效的视觉解释方面能力有限，且多关注文本推理，忽视了结构化可视化的重要性。

Method: 引入EduVisBench多领域多级别基准，并提出EduVisAgent多代理协作框架，分解推理并设计教育对齐的可视化。

Result: EduVisAgent显著优于基线模型，性能提升40.2%，生成更符合教育需求的视觉化内容。

Conclusion: EduVisBench和EduVisAgent为教育场景中的视觉推理提供了有效评估和改进工具。

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs), such as diffusion models and large
vision-language models (LVLMs), have been widely applied in educational
contexts, their ability to generate pedagogically effective visual explanations
remains limited. Most existing approaches focus primarily on textual reasoning,
overlooking the critical role of structured and interpretable visualizations in
supporting conceptual understanding. To better assess the visual reasoning
capabilities of FMs in educational settings, we introduce EduVisBench, a
multi-domain, multi-level benchmark. EduVisBench features diverse STEM problem
sets requiring visually grounded solutions, along with a fine-grained
evaluation rubric informed by pedagogical theory. Our empirical analysis
reveals that existing models frequently struggle with the inherent challenge of
decomposing complex reasoning and translating it into visual representations
aligned with human cognitive processes. To address these limitations, we
propose EduVisAgent, a multi-agent collaborative framework that coordinates
specialized agents for instructional planning, reasoning decomposition,
metacognitive prompting, and visualization design. Experimental results show
that EduVisAgent substantially outperforms all baselines, achieving a 40.2%
improvement and delivering more educationally aligned visualizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理场景中，LLM需要遵循冗长且复杂的指令，但其能力尚未被充分研究，因此需要系统评估。

Method: 构建AgentIF基准，包含50个真实代理应用的707条人工标注指令，涵盖复杂约束和工具规范，并采用多种评估方法。

Result: 现有LLM表现普遍较差，尤其在处理复杂约束和工具规范时。

Conclusion: AgentIF为未来研究提供了基准，揭示了LLM在代理场景中的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced capabilities in
real-world agentic applications. Growing research efforts aim to develop
LLM-based agents to address practical demands, introducing a new challenge:
agentic scenarios often involve lengthy instructions with complex constraints,
such as extended system prompts and detailed tool specifications. While
adherence to such instructions is crucial for agentic applications, whether
LLMs can reliably follow them remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce AgentIF, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating LLM
instruction following ability in agentic scenarios. AgentIF features three key
characteristics: (1) Realistic, constructed from 50 real-world agentic
applications. (2) Long, averaging 1,723 words with a maximum of 15,630 words.
(3) Complex, averaging 11.9 constraints per instruction, covering diverse
constraint types, such as tool specifications and condition constraints. To
construct AgentIF, we collect 707 human-annotated instructions across 50
agentic tasks from industrial application agents and open-source agentic
systems. For each instruction, we annotate the associated constraints and
corresponding evaluation metrics, including code-based evaluation, LLM-based
evaluation, and hybrid code-LLM evaluation. We use AgentIF to systematically
evaluate existing advanced LLMs. We observe that current models generally
perform poorly, especially in handling complex constraint structures and tool
specifications. We further conduct error analysis and analytical experiments on
instruction length and meta constraints, providing some findings about the
failure modes of existing LLMs. We have released the code and data to
facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于单一LLM的多智能体系统（MAS）受限于该模型的性能上限，无法充分发挥集体智能潜力。

Method: 提出异构LLM驱动的X-MAS框架，并设计X-MAS-Bench测试平台，对27种LLM在5个领域和5种功能上进行170万次评估。

Result: 异构配置在聊天机器人场景中性能提升8.4%，在混合场景中提升47%。

Conclusion: 异构LLM驱动的MAS具有显著性能优势，为可扩展协作AI系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) extend the capabilities of single LLMs by
enabling cooperation among multiple specialized agents. However, most existing
MAS frameworks rely on a single LLM to drive all agents, constraining the
system's intelligence to the limit of that model. This paper explores the
paradigm of heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS (X-MAS), where agents are powered by
diverse LLMs, elevating the system's potential to the collective intelligence
of diverse LLMs. We introduce X-MAS-Bench, a comprehensive testbed designed to
evaluate the performance of various LLMs across different domains and
MAS-related functions. As an extensive empirical study, we assess 27 LLMs
across 5 domains (encompassing 21 test sets) and 5 functions, conducting over
1.7 million evaluations to identify optimal model selections for each
domain-function combination. Building on these findings, we demonstrate that
transitioning from homogeneous to heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS can
significantly enhance system performance without requiring structural redesign.
Specifically, in a chatbot-only MAS scenario, the heterogeneous configuration
yields up to 8.4\% performance improvement on the MATH dataset. In a mixed
chatbot-reasoner scenario, the heterogeneous MAS could achieve a remarkable
47\% performance boost on the AIME dataset. Our results underscore the
transformative potential of heterogeneous LLMs in MAS, highlighting a promising
avenue for advancing scalable, collaborative AI systems.

Conclusion: D2R为动态空间推理提供了一种高效、无需微调的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: While chains-of-thought (CoT) have advanced complex reasoning in multimodal
large language models (MLLMs), existing methods remain confined to text or
static visual domains, often faltering in dynamic spatial reasoning tasks. To
bridge this gap, we present GRASSLAND, a novel maze navigation benchmark
designed to evaluate dynamic spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that
augmenting textual reasoning chains with dynamic visual drafts, overlaid on
input images, significantly outperforms conventional approaches, offering new
insights into spatial reasoning in evolving environments. To generalize this
capability, we propose D2R (Dynamic Draft-Augmented Reasoning), a training-free
framework that seamlessly integrates textual CoT with corresponding visual
drafts into MLLMs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that D2R consistently
enhances performance across diverse tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
dynamic spatial reasoning without requiring model fine-tuning. Project is open

TLDR: TON是一种两阶段训练策略，通过选择性推理减少计算成本，同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类思考过程启发，探索如何在需要时才进行推理，以减少不必要的计算开销。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：SFT阶段引入‘thought dropout’，GRPO阶段自由探索何时推理。

Result: TON比GRPO减少90%的完成长度，性能不降反升。

Conclusion: TON为强化学习实现类人推理模式提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be an effective post-training
strategy for enhancing reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a recent prominent method that
encourages models to generate complete reasoning traces before answering,
leading to increased token usage and computational cost. Inspired by the
human-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but
think carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when
reasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training
strategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective
'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with
empty thoughts. This introduces a think-or-not format that serves as a cold
start for selective reasoning; (ii) a GRPO stage that enables the model to
freely explore when to think or not, while maximizing task-aware outcome
rewards. Experimental results show that TON can reduce the completion length by
up to 90% compared to vanilla GRPO, without sacrificing performance or even
improving it. Further evaluations across diverse vision-language tasks-covering
a range of reasoning difficulties under both 3B and 7B models-consistently
reveal that the model progressively learns to bypass unnecessary reasoning
steps as training advances. These findings shed light on the path toward
human-like reasoning patterns in reinforcement learning approaches. Our code is

Motivation: 现有基准测试无法有效评估代理式检索增强生成（Agentic RAG）系统，因为它们局限于静态环境和简单查询，无法反映真实世界的动态性和开放性。

Method: 提出了一种系统化的方法，构建具有确定性、难度和多样性的挑战性查询，并开发了首个针对动态代理式信息检索的评估框架。

Result: 通过广泛的实验，InfoDeepSeek揭示了代理行为的细微差异，并为未来研究提供了实用见解。

Conclusion: InfoDeepSeek为动态网络环境中的代理式信息检索提供了有效的评估工具，推动了相关研究的进展。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
grounding responses with retrieved information. As an emerging paradigm,
Agentic RAG further enhances this process by introducing autonomous LLM agents
into the information seeking process. However, existing benchmarks fall short
in evaluating such systems, as they are confined to a static retrieval
environment with a fixed, limited corpus} and simple queries that fail to
elicit agentic behavior. Moreover, their evaluation protocols assess
information seeking effectiveness by pre-defined gold sets of documents, making
them unsuitable for the open-ended and dynamic nature of real-world web
environments. To bridge this gap, we present InfoDeepSeek, a new benchmark with
challenging questions designed for assessing agentic information seeking in
real-world, dynamic web environments. We propose a systematic methodology for
constructing challenging queries satisfying the criteria of determinacy,
difficulty, and diversity. Based on this, we develop the first evaluation
framework tailored to dynamic agentic information seeking, including
fine-grained metrics about the accuracy, utility, and compactness of
information seeking outcomes. Through extensive experiments across LLMs, search
engines, and question types, InfoDeepSeek reveals nuanced agent behaviors and
offers actionable insights for future research.

Motivation: 现有搜索日志数据缺乏多样性和细节，限制了EBR模型捕捉复杂搜索模式的能力。

Method: 提出Aug2Search框架，利用生成式AI生成合成数据（查询、增强产品列表等），并通过多模态和多任务方法优化查询-产品相关性。

Result: 实验显示，合成数据显著提升模型性能（ROC_AUC提高4%），且仅用合成数据训练的模型表现优于原始数据或混合数据。

Conclusion: 生成式AI生成的合成数据能有效增强EBR模型，为搜索技术提供新思路。

Abstract: Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) is an important technique in modern search
engines, enabling semantic match between search queries and relevant results.
However, search logging data on platforms like Facebook Marketplace lacks the
diversity and details needed for effective EBR model training, limiting the
models' ability to capture nuanced search patterns. To address this challenge,
we propose Aug2Search, an EBR-based framework leveraging synthetic data
generated by Generative AI (GenAI) models, in a multimodal and multitask
approach to optimize query-product relevance. This paper investigates the
capabilities of GenAI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in generating
high-quality synthetic data, and analyzing its impact on enhancing EBR models.
We conducted experiments using eight Llama models and 100 million data points
from Facebook Marketplace logs. Our synthetic data generation follows three
strategies: (1) generate queries, (2) enhance product listings, and (3)
generate queries from enhanced listings. We train EBR models on three different
datasets: sampled engagement data or original data ((e.g., "Click" and "Listing
Interactions")), synthetic data, and a mixture of both engagement and synthetic
data to assess their performance across various training sets. Our findings
underscore the robustness of Llama models in producing synthetic queries and
listings with high coherence, relevance, and diversity, while maintaining low
levels of hallucination. Aug2Search achieves an improvement of up to 4% in
ROC_AUC with 100 million synthetic data samples, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, our experiments reveal that with the
same volume of training data, models trained exclusively on synthetic data
often outperform those trained on original data only or a mixture of original
and synthetic data.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) faces dual challenges in
processing lengthy multimodal documents (text, images, tables) and performing
cross-modal reasoning. Current document retrieval-augmented generation (DocRAG)
methods remain limited by their text-centric approaches, frequently missing
critical visual information. The field also lacks robust benchmarks for
assessing multimodal evidence selection and integration. We introduce MMDocRAG,
a comprehensive benchmark featuring 4,055 expert-annotated QA pairs with
multi-page, cross-modal evidence chains. Our framework introduces innovative
metrics for evaluating multimodal quote selection and enables answers that
interleave text with relevant visual elements. Through large-scale experiments
with 60 VLM/LLM models and 14 retrieval systems, we identify persistent
challenges in multimodal evidence retrieval, selection, and integration.Key
findings reveal advanced proprietary LVMs show superior performance than
open-sourced alternatives. Also, they show moderate advantages using multimodal
inputs over text-only inputs, while open-source alternatives show significant
performance degradation. Notably, fine-tuned LLMs achieve substantial
improvements when using detailed image descriptions. MMDocRAG establishes a
rigorous testing ground and provides actionable insights for developing more

preferred. Experiments show that multilingual IR models perform moderately on
MiLQ and inconsistently across native, English, and mixed-language queries,
also suggesting code-switched training data's potential for robust IR models
handling such queries. Meanwhile, intentional English mixing in queries proves
an effective strategy for bilinguals searching English documents, which our
analysis attributes to enhanced token matching compared to native queries.

TLDR: 研究发现，基于推理的段落重排序器（ReasonRR）在相同训练条件下通常不如标准非推理重排序器（StandardRR）。进一步实验表明，禁用推理过程（ReasonRR-NoReason）反而更有效，原因是推理过程导致LLM偏向极端相关性评分，忽略部分相关性。

Motivation: 探索推理能力是否能提升基于LLM的段落重排序器的准确性。

Method: 比较推理型（ReasonRR）与非推理型（StandardRR）重排序器，并进一步禁用推理过程（ReasonRR-NoReason）。

Result: StandardRR优于ReasonRR；ReasonRR-NoReason比ReasonRR更有效。推理过程导致评分极化，忽略部分相关性。

Conclusion: 推理过程限制了重排序器的性能，未来研究需优化推理机制以避免评分极化。

Abstract: With the growing success of reasoning models across complex natural language
tasks, researchers in the Information Retrieval (IR) community have begun
exploring how similar reasoning capabilities can be integrated into passage
rerankers built on Large Language Models (LLMs). These methods typically employ
an LLM to produce an explicit, step-by-step reasoning process before arriving
at a final relevance prediction. But, does reasoning actually improve reranking
accuracy? In this paper, we dive deeper into this question, studying the impact
of the reasoning process by comparing reasoning-based pointwise rerankers
(ReasonRR) to standard, non-reasoning pointwise rerankers (StandardRR) under
identical training conditions, and observe that StandardRR generally
outperforms ReasonRR. Building on this observation, we then study the
importance of reasoning to ReasonRR by disabling its reasoning process
(ReasonRR-NoReason), and find that ReasonRR-NoReason is surprisingly more
effective than ReasonRR. Examining the cause of this result, our findings
reveal that reasoning-based rerankers are limited by the LLM's reasoning
process, which pushes it toward polarized relevance scores and thus fails to
consider the partial relevance of passages, a key factor for the accuracy of
pointwise rerankers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 某些数据集可能对模型效果产生负面影响，尤其是假阴性样本问题，需改进训练数据质量。

Method: 采用级联LLM提示方法识别和重新标记假阴性样本。

Result: 重新标记假阴性样本后，E5和Qwen2.5-7B模型在BEIR和AIR-Bench上性能提升0.7-1.8 nDCG@10。

Conclusion: 级联LLM方法有效提升数据质量，显著改善模型性能，且GPT-4o与人类标注一致性更高。

Abstract: Training robust retrieval and reranker models typically relies on large-scale
retrieval datasets; for example, the BGE collection contains 1.6 million
query-passage pairs sourced from various data sources. However, we find that
certain datasets can negatively impact model effectiveness -- pruning 8 out of
15 datasets from the BGE collection reduces the training set size by
2.35$\times$ and increases nDCG@10 on BEIR by 1.0 point. This motivates a
deeper examination of training data quality, with a particular focus on "false
negatives", where relevant passages are incorrectly labeled as irrelevant. We
propose a simple, cost-effective approach using cascading LLM prompts to
identify and relabel hard negatives. Experimental results show that relabeling
false negatives with true positives improves both E5 (base) and Qwen2.5-7B
retrieval models by 0.7-1.4 nDCG@10 on BEIR and by 1.7-1.8 nDCG@10 on zero-shot
AIR-Bench evaluation. Similar gains are observed for rerankers fine-tuned on
the relabeled data, such as Qwen2.5-3B on BEIR. The reliability of the
cascading design is further supported by human annotation results, where we
find judgment by GPT-4o shows much higher agreement with humans than
GPT-4o-mini.

Motivation: 现有研究将LLMs作为外部推理模块，导致资源成本高和联合优化不足，需要一种统一模型解决这些问题。

Method: 重新设计模型架构以实现推理和推荐的交替进行，并提出强化学习框架RecPO，通过融合奖励方案优化推理和推荐能力。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验显示，\name在Hit@5和NDCG@20指标上分别相对提升了68.67%和45.21%。

Conclusion: \name通过统一模型和强化学习框架，显著提升了推荐系统的推理和推荐能力，且无需依赖专门的推理标注。

Abstract: Large recommender models have extended LLMs as powerful recommenders via
encoding or item generation, and recent breakthroughs in LLM reasoning
synchronously motivate the exploration of reasoning in recommendation. Current
studies usually position LLMs as external reasoning modules to yield auxiliary
thought for augmenting conventional recommendation pipelines. However, such
decoupled designs are limited in significant resource cost and suboptimal joint
optimization. To address these issues, we propose \name, a unified large
recommender model with intrinsic reasoning capabilities. Initially, we
reconceptualize the model architecture to facilitate interleaved reasoning and
recommendation in the autoregressive process. Subsequently, we propose RecPO, a
corresponding reinforcement learning framework that optimizes \name\ both the
reasoning and recommendation capabilities simultaneously in a single policy
update; RecPO introduces a fused reward scheme that solely leverages
recommendation labels to simulate the reasoning capability, eliminating
dependency on specialized reasoning annotations. Experiments on three datasets
with various baselines verify the effectiveness of \name, showing relative
improvements of 68.67\% in Hit@5 and 45.21\% in NDCG@20. Code available at

Ability, and (4) Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness. We provide detailed
overviews within each category and highlight challenges in this field, offering
insights into promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first survey specifically focused on the evaluations of LALMs, providing
clear guidelines for the community. We will release the collection of the
surveyed papers and actively maintain it to support ongoing advancements in the
field.

Abstract: This paper introduces Meta-PerSER, a novel meta-learning framework that
personalizes Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) by adapting to each listener's
unique way of interpreting emotion. Conventional SER systems rely on aggregated
annotations, which often overlook individual subtleties and lead to
inconsistent predictions. In contrast, Meta-PerSER leverages a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning (MAML) approach enhanced with Combined-Set Meta-Training,
Derivative Annealing, and per-layer per-step learning rates, enabling rapid
adaptation with only a few labeled examples. By integrating robust
representations from pre-trained self-supervised models, our framework first
captures general emotional cues and then fine-tunes itself to personal
annotation styles. Experiments on the IEMOCAP corpus demonstrate that
Meta-PerSER significantly outperforms baseline methods in both seen and unseen
data scenarios, highlighting its promise for personalized emotion recognition.

Conclusion: P3M和边界聚焦损失提升了半监督医学图像分割性能，具有扩展性和适用性。

Abstract: Perturbation with diverse unlabeled data has proven beneficial for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS). While many works have
successfully used various perturbation techniques, a deeper understanding of
learning perturbations is needed. Excessive or inappropriate perturbation can
have negative effects, so we aim to address two challenges: how to use
perturbation mechanisms to guide the learning of unlabeled data through labeled
data, and how to ensure accurate predictions in boundary regions. Inspired by
human progressive and periodic learning, we propose a progressive and periodic
perturbation mechanism (P3M) and a boundary-focused loss. P3M enables dynamic
adjustment of perturbations, allowing the model to gradually learn them. Our
boundary-focused loss encourages the model to concentrate on boundary regions,
enhancing sensitivity to intricate details and ensuring accurate predictions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two 2D and 3D datasets. Moreover, P3M is extendable to other
methods, and the proposed loss serves as a universal tool for improving
existing methods, highlighting the scalability and applicability of our
approach.

Abstract: Foundation models leveraging vision-language pretraining have shown promise
in chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation, yet their real-world performance across
diverse populations and diagnostic tasks remains insufficiently evaluated. This
study benchmarks the diagnostic performance and generalizability of foundation
models versus traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on multinational
CXR datasets. We evaluated eight CXR diagnostic models - five vision-language
foundation models and three CNN-based architectures - across 37 standardized
classification tasks using six public datasets from the USA, Spain, India, and
Vietnam, and three private datasets from hospitals in China. Performance was
assessed using AUROC, AUPRC, and other metrics across both shared and
dataset-specific tasks. Foundation models outperformed CNNs in both accuracy
and task coverage. MAVL, a model incorporating knowledge-enhanced prompts and
structured supervision, achieved the highest performance on public (mean AUROC:
0.82; AUPRC: 0.32) and private (mean AUROC: 0.95; AUPRC: 0.89) datasets,
ranking first in 14 of 37 public and 3 of 4 private tasks. All models showed
reduced performance on pediatric cases, with average AUROC dropping from 0.88
+/- 0.18 in adults to 0.57 +/- 0.29 in children (p = 0.0202). These findings
highlight the value of structured supervision and prompt design in radiologic
AI and suggest future directions including geographic expansion and ensemble

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像压缩中计算开销大且需为不同比特率训练单独模型，增加了训练和存储成本。

Result: OSCAR在定量和视觉质量指标上均表现出色，显著提升了推理效率。

Conclusion: OSCAR通过一步去噪实现了高效的多比特率图像压缩，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Pretrained latent diffusion models have shown strong potential for lossy
image compression, owing to their powerful generative priors. Most existing
diffusion-based methods reconstruct images by iteratively denoising from random
noise, guided by compressed latent representations. While these approaches have
achieved high reconstruction quality, their multi-step sampling process incurs
substantial computational overhead. Moreover, they typically require training
separate models for different compression bit-rates, leading to significant
training and storage costs. To address these challenges, we propose a one-step
diffusion codec across multiple bit-rates. termed OSCAR. Specifically, our
method views compressed latents as noisy variants of the original latents,
where the level of distortion depends on the bit-rate. This perspective allows
them to be modeled as intermediate states along a diffusion trajectory. By
establishing a mapping from the compression bit-rate to a pseudo diffusion
timestep, we condition a single generative model to support reconstructions at
multiple bit-rates. Meanwhile, we argue that the compressed latents retain rich
structural information, thereby making one-step denoising feasible. Thus, OSCAR
replaces iterative sampling with a single denoising pass, significantly
improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSCAR
achieves superior performance in both quantitative and visual quality metrics.
The code and models will be released at https://github.com/jp-guo/OSCAR.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose to compress human body video with interactive
semantics, which can facilitate video coding to be interactive and controllable
by manipulating semantic-level representations embedded in the coded bitstream.
In particular, the proposed encoder employs a 3D human model to disentangle
nonlinear dynamics and complex motion of human body signal into a series of
configurable embeddings, which are controllably edited, compactly compressed,
and efficiently transmitted. Moreover, the proposed decoder can evolve the
mesh-based motion fields from these decoded semantics to realize the
high-quality human body video reconstruction. Experimental results illustrate
that the proposed framework can achieve promising compression performance for
human body videos at ultra-low bitrate ranges compared with the
state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and the
latest generative compression schemes. Furthermore, the proposed framework
enables interactive human body video coding without any additional
pre-/post-manipulation processes, which is expected to shed light on
metaverse-related digital human communication in the future.

Motivation: 解决现有像素空间变换编码方法在超低比特率下难以同时实现高真实感与高保真度的问题。

Method: 使用生成向量量化变分自编码器（VQ-VAE）的潜在空间进行变换编码，并引入空间分类超模块和时空分类超模块以提升性能。

Result: 在图像压缩中，GLC-image在CLIC 2020测试集上比特率低于0.04 bpp，比MS-ILLM节省45%比特率；在视频压缩中，GLC-video比PLVC节省65.3%比特率。

Conclusion: GLC方法在超低比特率下实现了高质量的图像和视频压缩，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Most existing approaches for image and video compression perform transform
coding in the pixel space to reduce redundancy. However, due to the
misalignment between the pixel-space distortion and human perception, such
schemes often face the difficulties in achieving both high-realism and
high-fidelity at ultra-low bitrate. To solve this problem, we propose
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{L}atent \textbf{C}oding (\textbf{GLC}) models for
image and video compression, termed GLC-image and GLC-Video. The transform
coding of GLC is conducted in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized
variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE). Compared to the pixel-space, such a latent
space offers greater sparsity, richer semantics and better alignment with human
perception, and show its advantages in achieving high-realism and high-fidelity
compression. To further enhance performance, we improve the hyper prior by
introducing a spatial categorical hyper module in GLC-image and a
spatio-temporal categorical hyper module in GLC-video. Additionally, the
code-prediction-based loss function is proposed to enhance the semantic
consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our scheme shows high visual quality
at ultra-low bitrate for both image and video compression. For image
compression, GLC-image achieves an impressive bitrate of less than $0.04$ bpp,
achieving the same FID as previous SOTA model MS-ILLM while using $45\%$ fewer
bitrate on the CLIC 2020 test set. For video compression, GLC-video achieves
65.3\% bitrate saving over PLVC in terms of DISTS.

Motivation: 现有研究主要从2D压缩测量和PAN图像中显式提取光谱和空间信息，导致高光谱重建瓶颈。物理因素（如温度、发射率和物体间多次反射）在高光谱热信号获取中起关键作用，因此研究这些物理特性之间的相互关系可为重建提供更深理论支持。

Conclusion: PCMamba通过物理驱动的合成过程和跨模态交互，实现了轻量级且高质量的高光谱重建，为DCCHI提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Panchromatic (PAN) -assisted Dual-Camera Compressive Hyperspectral Imaging
(DCCHI) is a key technology in snapshot hyperspectral imaging. Existing
research primarily focuses on exploring spectral information from 2D
compressive measurements and spatial information from PAN images in an explicit
manner, leading to a bottleneck in HSI reconstruction. Various physical
factors, such as temperature, emissivity, and multiple reflections between
objects, play a critical role in the process of a sensor acquiring
hyperspectral thermal signals. Inspired by this, we attempt to investigate the
interrelationships between physical properties to provide deeper theoretical
insights for HSI reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a Physics-Informed
Cross-Modal State Space Model Network (PCMamba) for DCCHI, which incorporates
the forward physical imaging process of HSI into the linear complexity of Mamba
to facilitate lightweight and high-quality HSI reconstruction. Specifically, we
analyze the imaging process of hyperspectral thermal signals to enable the
network to disentangle the three key physical properties-temperature,
emissivity, and texture. By fully exploiting the potential information embedded
in 2D measurements and PAN images, the HSIs are reconstructed through a
physics-driven synthesis process. Furthermore, we design a Cross-Modal Scanning
Mamba Block (CSMB) that introduces inter-modal pixel-wise interaction with
positional inductive bias by cross-scanning the backbone features and PAN
features. Extensive experiments conducted on both real and simulated datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both
quantitative and qualitative metrics.

TLDR: TDFormer是一种新型的脉冲神经网络模型，通过引入自上而下的反馈结构，提升了时间信息的传递和整合能力，显著提高了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SNN的膜电位作为时间步间唯一的信息链接，其隐式特性限制了时间信息的有效表示，导致模型性能受限。

Method: 提出TDFormer模型，采用分层自上而下反馈结构，利用早期时间步的高阶表示调节后期低阶信息的处理。

Result: 模型在多个数据集上表现显著提升，其中在ImageNet上达到86.83%的准确率。

Conclusion: TDFormer通过反馈结构增强了时间信息的传递和梯度传播，显著提升了SNN的性能。

Abstract: Traditional spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be viewed as a combination of
multiple subnetworks with each running for one time step, where the parameters
are shared, and the membrane potential serves as the only information link
between them. However, the implicit nature of the membrane potential limits its
ability to effectively represent temporal information. As a result, each time
step cannot fully leverage information from previous time steps, seriously
limiting the model's performance. Inspired by the top-down mechanism in the
brain, we introduce TDFormer, a novel model with a top-down feedback structure
that functions hierarchically and leverages high-order representations from
earlier time steps to modulate the processing of low-order information at later
stages. The feedback structure plays a role from two perspectives: 1) During
forward propagation, our model increases the mutual information across time
steps, indicating that richer temporal information is being transmitted and
integrated in different time steps. 2) During backward propagation, we
theoretically prove that the feedback structure alleviates the problem of
vanishing gradients along the time dimension. We find that these mechanisms
together significantly and consistently improve the model performance on
multiple datasets. In particular, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on ImageNet with an accuracy of 86.83%.

Abstract: The rapid advancement and expanding applications of Audio Large Language
Models (ALLMs) demand a rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness.
However, systematic research on evaluating these models, particularly
concerning risks unique to the audio modality, remains largely unexplored.
Existing evaluation frameworks primarily focus on the text modality or address
only a restricted set of safety dimensions, failing to adequately account for
the unique characteristics and application scenarios inherent to the audio
modality. We introduce AudioTrust-the first multifaceted trustworthiness
evaluation framework and benchmark specifically designed for ALLMs. AudioTrust
facilitates assessments across six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination,
safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. To comprehensively evaluate
these dimensions, AudioTrust is structured around 18 distinct experimental
setups. Its core is a meticulously constructed dataset of over 4,420 audio/text
samples, drawn from real-world scenarios (e.g., daily conversations, emergency
calls, voice assistant interactions), specifically designed to probe the
multifaceted trustworthiness of ALLMs. For assessment, the benchmark carefully
designs 9 audio-specific evaluation metrics, and we employ a large-scale
automated pipeline for objective and scalable scoring of model outputs.
Experimental results reveal the trustworthiness boundaries and limitations of
current state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs when confronted
with various high-risk audio scenarios, offering valuable insights for the
secure and trustworthy deployment of future audio models. Our platform and
benchmark are available at https://github.com/JusperLee/AudioTrust.
