### [1] [How Social is It? A Benchmark for LLMs' Capabilities in Multi-user Multi-turn Social Agent Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04628)
*Yusen Wu,Junwu Xiong,Xiaotie Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种评估大语言模型（LLM）在多用户、多轮社交任务中能力的基准HSII，并引入了基于社会学原理的任务分级框架和数据集HSII-Dataset。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统评估LLM在复杂社交场景中独立扮演角色能力的基准，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出HSII基准，包含四个阶段：格式解析、目标选择、目标切换对话和稳定对话，并利用HSII-Dataset进行评估。同时研究了思维链（COT）方法对LLM社交能力的提升效果。

Result: 实验结果表明HSII基准能有效评估LLM的社交能力，并提出了新的统计指标COT-complexity以平衡正确性和效率。

Conclusion: HSII基准适用于评估LLM的社交技能，为未来研究提供了工具和方向。

Abstract: Expanding the application of large language models (LLMs) to societal life,
instead of primary function only as auxiliary assistants to communicate with
only one person at a time, necessitates LLMs' capabilities to independently
play roles in multi-user, multi-turn social agent tasks within complex social
settings. However, currently the capability has not been systematically
measured with available benchmarks. To address this gap, we first introduce an
agent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles.
Concurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII
below), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social
agents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages:
format parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable
conversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion
capabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset,
HSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform
an ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we
investigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs'
social performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new
statistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs
with COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between
measurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments
demonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in
LLMs.

### [2] [Adaptive Token Boundaries: Integrating Human Chunking Mechanisms into Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04637)
*Dongxing Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该研究探讨了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）与人类跨模态信息处理的差异，提出了一种动态跨模态标记化框架，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在模拟人类动态、上下文敏感的信息处理能力方面存在局限，研究旨在缩小这一差距。

Method: 通过比较人类与模型在视觉-语言任务中的表现，提出动态跨模态标记化框架，包含自适应边界、分层表示和对齐机制。

Result: 新框架在基准任务上显著优于现有模型（VQA提升7.8%，复杂场景描述提升5.3%），且错误模式和注意力分布更接近人类。

Conclusion: 研究为理解人类认知与AI的关系提供了理论支持，并为开发更符合认知的AI系统提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing diverse data types, yet
significant disparities persist between human cognitive processes and
computational approaches to multimodal information integration. This research
presents a systematic investigation into the parallels between human
cross-modal chunking mechanisms and token representation methodologies in
MLLMs. Through empirical studies comparing human performance patterns with
model behaviors across visual-linguistic tasks, we demonstrate that
conventional static tokenization schemes fundamentally constrain current
models' capacity to simulate the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of human
information processing. We propose a novel framework for dynamic cross-modal
tokenization that incorporates adaptive boundaries, hierarchical
representations, and alignment mechanisms grounded in cognitive science
principles. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art models on
benchmark tasks (+7.8% on Visual Question Answering, +5.3% on Complex Scene
Description) while exhibiting more human-aligned error patterns and attention
distributions. These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of
the relationship between human cognition and artificial intelligence, while
providing empirical evidence for developing more cognitively plausible AI
systems.

### [3] [Language translation, and change of accent for speech-to-speech task using diffusion model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04639)
*Abhishek Mishra,Ritesh Sur Chowdhury,Vartul Bahuguna,Isha Pandey,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种统一的方法，同时实现语音翻译和口音适应，利用扩散模型生成高质量的目标语音。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨文化沟通需要同时处理语言翻译和口音适应，但目前研究较少。

Method: 将任务重新定义为条件生成问题，利用扩散模型生成目标语音的梅尔频谱，结合源语音转录和目标语音特征。

Result: 该方法比传统流程更高效且效果更好。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架为语音翻译和口音适应提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to convert spoken input in one
language to spoken output in another, typically focusing on either language
translation or accent adaptation. However, effective cross-cultural
communication requires handling both aspects simultaneously - translating
content while adapting the speaker's accent to match the target language
context. In this work, we propose a unified approach for simultaneous speech
translation and change of accent, a task that remains underexplored in current
literature. Our method reformulates the problem as a conditional generation
task, where target speech is generated based on phonemes and guided by target
speech features. Leveraging the power of diffusion models, known for
high-fidelity generative capabilities, we adapt text-to-image diffusion
strategies by conditioning on source speech transcriptions and generating Mel
spectrograms representing the target speech with desired linguistic and
accentual attributes. This integrated framework enables joint optimization of
translation and accent adaptation, offering a more parameter-efficient and
effective model compared to traditional pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估Typica.ai针对摩洛哥Darija的毒性检测模型在文化相关毒性内容（如隐性侮辱、讽刺等）上的表现，并与主流LLM API对比。

Method: 使用OMCD_Typica.ai_Mix数据集，比较Typica.ai模型与OpenAI、Mistral、Anthropic Claude的精度、召回率、F1分数和准确率。

Result: Typica.ai模型表现最佳，凸显文化适应模型在内容审核中的重要性。

Conclusion: 文化适应模型对可靠内容审核至关重要，Typica.ai在摩洛哥Darija毒性检测中表现卓越。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative benchmark evaluating the performance of
Typica.ai's custom Moroccan Darija toxicity detection model against major
LLM-based moderation APIs: OpenAI (omni-moderation-latest), Mistral
(mistral-moderation-latest), and Anthropic Claude (claude-3-haiku-20240307). We
focus on culturally grounded toxic content, including implicit insults,
sarcasm, and culturally specific aggression often overlooked by general-purpose
systems. Using a balanced test set derived from the OMCD_Typica.ai_Mix dataset,
we report precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, offering insights into
challenges and opportunities for moderation in underrepresented languages. Our
results highlight Typica.ai's superior performance, underlining the importance
of culturally adapted models for reliable content moderation.

### [5] [Rethinking Multimodal Sentiment Analysis: A High-Accuracy, Simplified Fusion Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04642)
*Nischal Mandal,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种轻量级的多模态情感分析模型，通过简单的特征融合方法在资源受限环境中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析需要整合语言、音频和视觉信号，但现有方法常依赖复杂的注意力机制和层次结构，计算开销大。

Method: 设计了一种基于模态特定编码器和简单拼接融合的轻量级深度学习模型，使用全连接层和dropout正则化。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上实现了92%的分类准确率，证明了简单融合策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的特征工程和模块化设计，轻量级模型可以在资源受限环境中媲美或超越复杂模型。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis, a pivotal task in affective computing, seeks
to understand human emotions by integrating cues from language, audio, and
visual signals. While many recent approaches leverage complex attention
mechanisms and hierarchical architectures, we propose a lightweight, yet
effective fusion-based deep learning model tailored for utterance-level emotion
classification. Using the benchmark IEMOCAP dataset, which includes aligned
text, audio-derived numeric features, and visual descriptors, we design a
modality-specific encoder using fully connected layers followed by dropout
regularization. The modality-specific representations are then fused using
simple concatenation and passed through a dense fusion layer to capture
cross-modal interactions. This streamlined architecture avoids computational
overhead while preserving performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
92% across six emotion categories. Our approach demonstrates that with careful
feature engineering and modular design, simpler fusion strategies can
outperform or match more complex models, particularly in resource-constrained
environments.

### [6] [Prediction-powered estimators for finite population statistics in highly imbalanced textual data: Public hate crime estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04643)
*Hannes Waldetoft,Jakob Torgander,Måns Magnusson*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 结合Transformer编码器神经网络与调查抽样估计器，利用模型预测作为辅助变量，高效估计有限文本数据集的总体参数，减少人工标注时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决有限文本数据集中手动标注目标变量标签的挑战。

Method: 结合Transformer编码器神经网络预测与Hansen-Hurwitz估计器、差异估计和分层随机抽样估计。

Result: 在瑞典仇恨犯罪统计数据中验证了方法的适用性，提供了高效的估计结果。

Conclusion: 若有标注训练数据，该方法可显著减少人工标注时间并提供高效估计。

Abstract: Estimating population parameters in finite populations of text documents can
be challenging when obtaining the labels for the target variable requires
manual annotation. To address this problem, we combine predictions from a
transformer encoder neural network with well-established survey sampling
estimators using the model predictions as an auxiliary variable. The
applicability is demonstrated in Swedish hate crime statistics based on Swedish
police reports. Estimates of the yearly number of hate crimes and the police's
under-reporting are derived using the Hansen-Hurwitz estimator, difference
estimation, and stratified random sampling estimation. We conclude that if
labeled training data is available, the proposed method can provide very
efficient estimates with reduced time spent on manual annotation.

### [7] [ChatGPT for automated grading of short answer questions in mechanical ventilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04645)
*Tejas Jade,Alex Yartsev*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究评估了ChatGPT 4o在研究生医学教育中自动评分短答案问题的表现，发现其评分与人类评分存在显著差异，不建议用于高风险评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在模拟对话语言和解释自由文本回答方面的能力使其在自动评分中具有吸引力，但其在研究生教育中的实际表现尚未明确。

Method: 使用ChatGPT 4o对215名学生的557个短答案回答进行评分，并与人类评分对比，采用多种统计方法分析一致性。

Result: ChatGPT评分系统性低于人类评分（平均偏差-1.34/10），个体一致性差（ICC1=0.086），且60%以上评分超出可接受范围。

Conclusion: 不建议在研究生课程评分中使用LLMs，尤其是高风险评估，因其评分与人类评分一致性不足。

Abstract: Standardised tests using short answer questions (SAQs) are common in
postgraduate education. Large language models (LLMs) simulate conversational
language and interpret unstructured free-text responses in ways aligning with
applying SAQ grading rubrics, making them attractive for automated grading. We
evaluated ChatGPT 4o to grade SAQs in a postgraduate medical setting using data
from 215 students (557 short-answer responses) enrolled in an online course on
mechanical ventilation (2020--2024). Deidentified responses to three case-based
scenarios were presented to ChatGPT with a standardised grading prompt and
rubric. Outputs were analysed using mixed-effects modelling, variance component
analysis, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), Cohen's kappa, Kendall's
W, and Bland--Altman statistics. ChatGPT awarded systematically lower marks
than human graders with a mean difference (bias) of -1.34 on a 10-point scale.
ICC values indicated poor individual-level agreement (ICC1 = 0.086), and
Cohen's kappa (-0.0786) suggested no meaningful agreement. Variance component
analysis showed minimal variability among the five ChatGPT sessions (G-value =
0.87), indicating internal consistency but divergence from the human grader.
The poorest agreement was observed for evaluative and analytic items, whereas
checklist and prescriptive rubric items had less disagreement. We caution
against the use of LLMs in grading postgraduate coursework. Over 60% of
ChatGPT-assigned grades differed from human grades by more than acceptable
boundaries for high-stakes assessments.

Conclusion: FRAME为自动化医学论文生成提供了高效且严谨的解决方案。

Abstract: The automation of scientific research through large language models (LLMs)
presents significant opportunities but faces critical challenges in knowledge
synthesis and quality assurance. We introduce Feedback-Refined Agent
Methodology (FRAME), a novel framework that enhances medical paper generation
through iterative refinement and structured feedback. Our approach comprises
three key innovations: (1) A structured dataset construction method that
decomposes 4,287 medical papers into essential research components through
iterative refinement; (2) A tripartite architecture integrating Generator,
Evaluator, and Reflector agents that progressively improve content quality
through metric-driven feedback; and (3) A comprehensive evaluation framework
that combines statistical metrics with human-grounded benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate FRAME's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements
over conventional approaches across multiple models (9.91% average gain with
DeepSeek V3, comparable improvements with GPT-4o Mini) and evaluation
dimensions. Human evaluation confirms that FRAME-generated papers achieve
quality comparable to human-authored works, with particular strength in
synthesizing future research directions. The results demonstrated our work
could efficiently assist medical research by building a robust foundation for
automated medical research paper generation while maintaining rigorous academic
standards.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming scientific hypothesis
generation and validation by enabling information synthesis, latent
relationship discovery, and reasoning augmentation. This survey provides a
structured overview of LLM-driven approaches, including symbolic frameworks,
generative models, hybrid systems, and multi-agent architectures. We examine
techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation, knowledge-graph completion,
simulation, causal inference, and tool-assisted reasoning, highlighting
trade-offs in interpretability, novelty, and domain alignment. We contrast
early symbolic discovery systems (e.g., BACON, KEKADA) with modern LLM
pipelines that leverage in-context learning and domain adaptation via
fine-tuning, retrieval, and symbolic grounding. For validation, we review
simulation, human-AI collaboration, causal modeling, and uncertainty
quantification, emphasizing iterative assessment in open-world contexts. The
survey maps datasets across biomedicine, materials science, environmental
science, and social science, introducing new resources like AHTech and
CSKG-600. Finally, we outline a roadmap emphasizing novelty-aware generation,
multimodal-symbolic integration, human-in-the-loop systems, and ethical
safeguards, positioning LLMs as agents for principled, scalable scientific
discovery.

TLDR: AMIE通过多模态数据处理能力在诊断对话中表现出色，优于初级保健医生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在多模态医疗咨询中的表现，填补远程医疗中的实际需求空白。

Method: 利用Gemini 2.0 Flash实现状态感知对话框架，动态控制对话流程，模拟经验丰富的医生。

Result: AMIE在多模态和非多模态评估中均优于初级保健医生。

Conclusion: 多模态对话诊断AI取得进展，但实际应用仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for conducting
diagnostic conversations but evaluation has been largely limited to
language-only interactions, deviating from the real-world requirements of
remote care delivery. Instant messaging platforms permit clinicians and
patients to upload and discuss multimodal medical artifacts seamlessly in
medical consultation, but the ability of LLMs to reason over such data while
preserving other attributes of competent diagnostic conversation remains
unknown. Here we advance the conversational diagnosis and management
performance of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a
new capability to gather and interpret multimodal data, and reason about this
precisely during consultations. Leveraging Gemini 2.0 Flash, our system
implements a state-aware dialogue framework, where conversation flow is
dynamically controlled by intermediate model outputs reflecting patient states
and evolving diagnoses. Follow-up questions are strategically directed by
uncertainty in such patient states, leading to a more structured multimodal
history-taking process that emulates experienced clinicians. We compared AMIE
to primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, blinded, OSCE-style study of
chat-based consultations with patient actors. We constructed 105 evaluation
scenarios using artifacts like smartphone skin photos, ECGs, and PDFs of
clinical documents across diverse conditions and demographics. Our rubric
assessed multimodal capabilities and other clinically meaningful axes like
history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication, and
empathy. Specialist evaluation showed AMIE to be superior to PCPs on 7/9
multimodal and 29/32 non-multimodal axes (including diagnostic accuracy). The
results show clear progress in multimodal conversational diagnostic AI, but
real-world translation needs further research.

Method: 通过比较DeepSeek-V3、GPT系列和Gemini等模型的伦理表现，并引入RDC指标量化危害。

Result: 研究发现不同模型在伦理表现上存在显著差异，RDC能有效衡量潜在危害。

Conclusion: 需加强高风险场景中的人类监督，RDC为伦理评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly
evolved in recent years, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural language
understanding and generation. However, these advancements also raise critical
ethical questions regarding safety, potential misuse, discrimination and
overall societal impact. This article provides a comparative analysis of the
ethical performance of various AI models, including the brand new
DeepSeek-V3(R1 with reasoning and without), various GPT variants (4o, 3.5
Turbo, 4 Turbo, o1/o3 mini) and Gemini (1.5 flash, 2.0 flash and 2.0 flash exp)
and highlights the need for robust human oversight, especially in situations
with high stakes. Furthermore, we present a new metric for calculating harm in
LLMs called Relative Danger Coefficient (RDC).

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种结合传统深度学习和大型语言模型（LLMs）的方法，自动从临床文本中提取社会健康决定因素（SDoH），并展示了其在分类任务中的高效性和性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对个体健康状态有重要影响，但传统方法效率低且成本高。本研究旨在开发一种更高效、精确的自动提取方法。

Method: 结合传统深度学习和LLMs，提出了一种高效分类方法，避免昂贵的LLM处理，同时利用LLM的精确性。

Result: 模型在SDoH多标签分类任务中比基准方法提高了10分，且执行时间缩短了12倍。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在效率和性能上均优于传统方法，为自动预测SDoH提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) are economic, social and personal
circumstances that affect or influence an individual's health status. SDoHs
have shown to be correlated to wellness outcomes, and therefore, are useful to
physicians in diagnosing diseases and in decision-making. In this work, we
automatically extract SDoHs from clinical text using traditional deep learning
and Large Language Models (LLMs) to find the advantages and disadvantages of
each on an existing publicly available dataset. Our models outperform a
previous reference point on a multilabel SDoH classification by 10 points, and
we present a method and model to drastically speed up classification (12X
execution time) by eliminating expensive LLM processing. The method we present
combines a more nimble and efficient solution that leverages the power of the
LLM for precision and traditional deep learning methods for efficiency. We also
show highly performant results on a dataset supplemented with synthetic data
and several traditional deep learning models that outperform LLMs. Our models
and methods offer the next iteration of automatic prediction of SDoHs that
impact at-risk patients.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究探讨了利用大语言模型（LLMs）生成合成跌倒数据以解决真实数据稀缺的问题，评估了文本到动作和文本到文本模型的性能，并分析了合成数据对跌倒检测模型的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实跌倒数据（尤其是老年人）稀缺，训练跌倒检测系统面临挑战，因此探索LLMs生成合成数据的潜力。

Method: 使用文本到动作（T2M, SATO, ParCo）和文本到文本（GPT4o, GPT4, Gemini）模型生成合成数据，并与真实数据集结合，通过LSTM模型评估性能。同时比较LLM生成数据与扩散方法的数据分布对齐性。

Result: 合成数据的有效性受数据集特性影响，LLM生成数据在低频（20Hz）表现最佳，但在高频（200Hz）不稳定。扩散方法数据与真实数据对齐性最好，但未显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 合成数据的有效性取决于传感器位置和跌倒表示方式，研究为优化跌倒检测模型的合成数据生成提供了见解。

Abstract: Training fall detection systems is challenging due to the scarcity of
real-world fall data, particularly from elderly individuals. To address this,
we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating
synthetic fall data. This study evaluates text-to-motion (T2M, SATO, ParCo) and
text-to-text models (GPT4o, GPT4, Gemini) in simulating realistic fall
scenarios. We generate synthetic datasets and integrate them with four
real-world baseline datasets to assess their impact on fall detection
performance using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Additionally, we
compare LLM-generated synthetic data with a diffusion-based method to evaluate
their alignment with real accelerometer distributions. Results indicate that
dataset characteristics significantly influence the effectiveness of synthetic
data, with LLM-generated data performing best in low-frequency settings (e.g.,
20Hz) while showing instability in high-frequency datasets (e.g., 200Hz). While
text-to-motion models produce more realistic biomechanical data than
text-to-text models, their impact on fall detection varies. Diffusion-based
synthetic data demonstrates the closest alignment to real data but does not
consistently enhance model performance. An ablation study further confirms that
the effectiveness of synthetic data depends on sensor placement and fall
representation. These findings provide insights into optimizing synthetic data
generation for fall detection models.

TLDR: 论文研究了结合大语言模型（如BERT）的个性化广告推荐系统，同时关注用户隐私保护和数据安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在实际操作中如何将广告推荐系统与隐私保护措施结合，解决个性化推荐中的风险问题。

Method: 结合BERT模型和注意力机制，构建算法模型，包括数据预处理、特征选择、语义嵌入和本地模型训练。

Result: 实验表明，基于BERT的广告推荐能提高点击率和转化率，同时通过隐私保护机制降低数据泄露风险。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在广告推荐中具有潜力，但需结合隐私保护技术以实现实际应用。

Abstract: Although large language models have demonstrated the potential for
personalized advertising recommendations in experimental environments, in
actual operations, how advertising recommendation systems can be combined with
measures such as user privacy protection and data security is still an area
worthy of in-depth discussion. To this end, this paper studies the personalized
risks and regulatory strategies of large language models in digital
advertising. This study first outlines the principles of Large Language Model
(LLM), especially the self-attention mechanism based on the Transformer
architecture, and how to enable the model to understand and generate natural
language text. Then, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers) model and the attention mechanism are combined to construct an
algorithmic model for personalized advertising recommendations and user factor
risk protection. The specific steps include: data collection and preprocessing,
feature selection and construction, using large language models such as BERT
for advertising semantic embedding, and ad recommendations based on user
portraits. Then, local model training and data encryption are used to ensure
the security of user privacy and avoid the leakage of personal data. This paper
designs an experiment for personalized advertising recommendation based on a
large language model of BERT and verifies it with real user data. The
experimental results show that BERT-based advertising push can effectively
improve the click-through rate and conversion rate of advertisements. At the
same time, through local model training and privacy protection mechanisms, the
risk of user privacy leakage can be reduced to a certain extent.

to frequent updates, making manual querying challenging and time-consuming. Key
difficulties include navigating large volumes of text, interpreting technical
language, and identifying relevant clauses across different sections. A
potential solution is to build a Question-Answering (QA) system that answers
user queries based on building codes. Among the various methods for building a
QA system, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stands out in performance. RAG
consists of two components: a retriever and a language model. This study
focuses on identifying a suitable retriever method for building codes and
optimizing the generational capability of the language model using fine-tuning
techniques. We conducted a detailed evaluation of various retrieval methods by
performing the retrieval on the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) and
explored the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning on several language models
using the dataset derived from NBCC. Our analysis included a comparative
assessment of different retrievers and the performance of both pre-trained and
fine-tuned models to determine the efficacy and domain-specific adaptation of
language models using fine-tuning on the NBCC dataset. Experimental results
showed that Elasticsearch proved to be the most robust retriever among all. The
findings also indicate that fine-tuning language models on an NBCC-specific
dataset can enhance their ability to generate contextually relevant responses.
When combined with context retrieved by a powerful retriever like
Elasticsearch, this improvement in LLM performance can optimize the RAG system,
enabling it to better navigate the complexities of the NBCC.

*Yuxin Zhang,Meihao Fan,Ju Fan,Mingyang Yi,Yuyu Luo,Jian Tan,Guoliang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: Reward-SQL提出了一种结合Process Reward Models（PRMs）的框架，通过分步推理链和四种PRM集成策略，显著提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管PRMs能增强Text-to-SQL推理的准确性，但滥用可能导致推理轨迹扭曲。Reward-SQL旨在系统研究如何有效整合PRMs。

Method: 采用“冷启动后PRM监督”范式：先训练模型分解SQL查询为结构化推理链（Chain-of-CTEs），再探索四种PRM集成策略。最佳策略为在线训练信号（GRPO）与PRM引导推理（如best-of-N采样）结合。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，Reward-SQL使7B PRM监督的模型性能提升13.1%。基于Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct的GRPO策略模型达到68.9%准确率，优于同类基线方法。

Conclusion: Reward-SQL通过奖励监督有效提升了Text-to-SQL推理性能，证明了PRMs的合理整合价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
performance on the Text-to-SQL task by leveraging their powerful reasoning
capabilities. To enhance accuracy during the reasoning process, external
Process Reward Models (PRMs) can be introduced during training and inference to
provide fine-grained supervision. However, if misused, PRMs may distort the
reasoning trajectory and lead to suboptimal or incorrect SQL generation.To
address this challenge, we propose Reward-SQL, a framework that systematically
explores how to incorporate PRMs into the Text-to-SQL reasoning process
effectively. Our approach follows a "cold start, then PRM supervision"
paradigm. Specifically, we first train the model to decompose SQL queries into
structured stepwise reasoning chains using common table expressions
(Chain-of-CTEs), establishing a strong and interpretable reasoning baseline.
Then, we investigate four strategies for integrating PRMs, and find that
combining PRM as an online training signal (GRPO) with PRM-guided inference
(e.g., best-of-N sampling) yields the best results. Empirically, on the BIRD
benchmark, Reward-SQL enables models supervised by a 7B PRM to achieve a 13.1%
performance gain across various guidance strategies. Notably, our GRPO-aligned
policy model based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct achieves 68.9% accuracy on the
BIRD development set, outperforming all baseline methods under the same model
size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Reward-SQL in leveraging
reward-based supervision for Text-to-SQL reasoning. Our code is publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全评估框架无法应对VLLMs在多模态和多轮对话中的复杂性，因此需要新的评估方法。

Method: 提出REVEAL框架，包括自动图像挖掘、合成对抗数据生成、多轮对话扩展和全面危害评估。

Result: 评估了五种VLLMs，发现多轮对话缺陷率更高，GPT-4o表现最佳，Llama-3.2缺陷率最高。

Conclusion: 多轮对话暴露了VLLMs的深层漏洞，需加强上下文防御，尤其在错误信息领域。

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) represent a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence by integrating image-processing capabilities with
textual understanding, thereby enhancing user interactions and expanding
application domains. However, their increased complexity introduces novel
safety and ethical challenges, particularly in multi-modal and multi-turn
conversations. Traditional safety evaluation frameworks, designed for
text-based, single-turn interactions, are inadequate for addressing these
complexities. To bridge this gap, we introduce the REVEAL (Responsible
Evaluation of Vision-Enabled AI LLMs) Framework, a scalable and automated
pipeline for evaluating image-input harms in VLLMs. REVEAL includes automated
image mining, synthetic adversarial data generation, multi-turn conversational
expansion using crescendo attack strategies, and comprehensive harm assessment
through evaluators like GPT-4o.
  We extensively evaluated five state-of-the-art VLLMs, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2,
Qwen2-VL, Phi3.5V, and Pixtral, across three important harm categories: sexual
harm, violence, and misinformation. Our findings reveal that multi-turn
interactions result in significantly higher defect rates compared to
single-turn evaluations, highlighting deeper vulnerabilities in VLLMs. Notably,
GPT-4o demonstrated the most balanced performance as measured by our
Safety-Usability Index (SUI) followed closely by Pixtral. Additionally,
misinformation emerged as a critical area requiring enhanced contextual
defenses. Llama-3.2 exhibited the highest MT defect rate ($16.55 \%$) while
Qwen2-VL showed the highest MT refusal rate ($19.1 \%$).

Abstract: This paper presents a thoroughly automated method for identifying and
interpreting cuneiform characters via advanced deep-learning algorithms. Five
distinct deep-learning models were trained on a comprehensive dataset of
cuneiform characters and evaluated according to critical performance metrics,
including accuracy and precision. Two models demonstrated outstanding
performance and were subsequently assessed using cuneiform symbols from the
Hammurabi law acquisition, notably Hammurabi Law 1. Each model effectively
recognized the relevant Akkadian meanings of the symbols and delivered precise
English translations. Future work will investigate ensemble and stacking
approaches to optimize performance, utilizing hybrid architectures to improve
detection accuracy and reliability. This research explores the linguistic
relationships between Akkadian, an ancient Mesopotamian language, and Arabic,
emphasizing their historical and cultural linkages. This study demonstrates the
capability of deep learning to decipher ancient scripts by merging
computational linguistics with archaeology, therefore providing significant
insights for the comprehension and conservation of human history.

TLDR: 本文提出SOAEsV2-7B/72B，一种针对中国国有资产的领域专用大语言模型，通过三阶段框架解决现有方法的局限性，包括模型容量、数据依赖和推理效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在开发中国国有资产领域专用大语言模型时面临模型容量限制、过度依赖领域特定数据以及推理效率低下的问题。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：1) 持续预训练整合领域知识；2) 领域渐进式监督微调；3) 蒸馏增强的推测解码加速推理。

Result: 实验结果显示，领域专用预训练保留了99.8%的通用语言能力，同时显著提升领域性能（Rouge-1提升1.08倍，BLEU-4提升1.17倍）。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种全流程优化方法，成功弥合了通用语言能力与领域专用知识之间的差距。

Abstract: This study addresses key challenges in developing domain-specific large
language models (LLMs) for Chinese state-owned assets and enterprises (SOAEs),
where current approaches face three limitations: 1) constrained model capacity
that limits knowledge integration and cross-task adaptability; 2) excessive
reliance on domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data, which neglects
the broader applicability of general language patterns; and 3) inefficient
inference acceleration for large models processing long contexts. In this work,
we propose SOAEsV2-7B/72B, a specialized LLM series developed via a three-phase
framework: 1) continual pre-training integrates domain knowledge while
retaining base capabilities; 2) domain-progressive SFT employs curriculum-based
learning strategy, transitioning from weakly relevant conversational data to
expert-annotated SOAEs datasets to optimize domain-specific tasks; 3)
distillation-enhanced speculative decoding accelerates inference via logit
distillation between 72B target and 7B draft models, achieving
1.39-1.52$\times$ speedup without quality loss. Experimental results
demonstrate that our domain-specific pre-training phase maintains 99.8% of
original general language capabilities while significantly improving domain
performance, resulting in a 1.08$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 score and a
1.17$\times$ enhancement in BLEU-4 score. Ablation studies further show that
domain-progressive SFT outperforms single-stage training, achieving
1.02$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 and 1.06$\times$ in BLEU-4. Our work
introduces a comprehensive, full-pipeline approach for optimizing SOAEs LLMs,
bridging the gap between general language capabilities and domain-specific
expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管前人研究已独立探讨了唐宋时期的文学与艺术，但两者之间的系统性关联仍未被充分探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用微调的BERT模型分析唐宋诗词中的牡丹和梅花意象，检测情感变化，并与同期装饰艺术的视觉证据进行交叉验证。

Result: 研究发现唐宋时期花卉意象的情感内涵有明显变化，并揭示了文学表达与艺术表现之间未被认识的协同关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解唐宋文化表达提供了新视角，展示了计算人文与传统汉学方法的结合潜力。

Abstract: The Tang (618 to 907) and Song (960 to 1279) dynasties witnessed an
extraordinary flourishing of Chinese cultural expression, where floral motifs
served as a dynamic medium for both poetic sentiment and artistic design. While
previous scholarship has examined these domains independently, the systematic
correlation between evolving literary emotions and visual culture remains
underexplored. This study addresses that gap by employing BERT-based sentiment
analysis to quantify emotional patterns in floral imagery across Tang Song
poetry, then validating these patterns against contemporaneous developments in
decorative arts.Our approach builds upon recent advances in computational
humanities while remaining grounded in traditional sinological methods. By
applying a fine tuned BERT model to analyze peony and plum blossom imagery in
classical poetry, we detect measurable shifts in emotional connotations between
the Tang and Song periods. These textual patterns are then cross berenced with
visual evidence from textiles, ceramics, and other material culture, revealing
previously unrecognized synergies between literary expression and artistic
representation.

Conclusion: 该方法为幻觉检测提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have gained widespread adoption
by application builders because they leverage sources of truth to enable Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate more factually sound responses. However,
hallucinations, instances of LLM responses that are unfaithful to the provided
context, often prevent these systems from being deployed in production
environments. Current hallucination detection methods typically involve human
evaluation or the use of closed-source models to review RAG system outputs for
hallucinations. Both human evaluators and closed-source models suffer from
scaling issues due to their high costs and slow inference speeds. In this work,
we introduce a perturbed multi-hop QA dataset with induced hallucinations. Via
supervised fine-tuning on our dataset, we achieve better recall with a 7B model
than GPT-4o on the RAGTruth hallucination detection benchmark and offer
competitive performance on precision and accuracy, all while using a fraction
of the parameters. Code is released at our repository.

Conclusion: FaithJudge为LLM幻觉评估提供了更可靠的基准，推动了RAG领域的发展。

Abstract: Hallucinations remain a persistent challenge for LLMs. RAG aims to reduce
hallucinations by grounding responses in contexts. However, even when provided
context, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported information or
contradictions. This paper presents our efforts to measure LLM hallucinations
with a focus on summarization tasks, assessing how often various LLMs introduce
hallucinations when summarizing documents. We discuss Vectara's existing LLM
hallucination leaderboard, based on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model
(HHEM). While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great
research interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current
hallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods
on existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose
FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination
annotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination
evaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination
leaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination
leaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in
RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义检索系统难以适应学术内容的独特语言和结构特点，因此需要开发更适合教育领域的嵌入模型。

Method: 构建了包含3,197个句对的合成数据集，并评估了两种训练策略：基于MNRL的基准模型和结合MNRL与CosineSimilarityLoss的双重损失模型。

Result: 两种优化模型均优于开源基线，双重损失模型缩小了与高性能专有嵌入模型的差距。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了可复用的教育领域嵌入模型和语义检索框架，支持学术聊天机器人等下游应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI have catalyzed the adoption of intelligent educational
tools, yet many semantic retrieval systems remain ill-suited to the unique
linguistic and structural characteristics of academic content. This study
presents two open-source embedding models fine-tuned for educational question
answering, particularly in the context of course syllabi. A synthetic dataset
of 3,197 sentence pairs, spanning synonymous terminology, paraphrased
questions, and implicit-explicit mappings, was constructed through a
combination of manual curation and large language model (LLM)-assisted
generation. Two training strategies were evaluated: (1) a baseline model
fine-tuned using MultipleNegativesRankingLoss (MNRL), and (2) a dual-loss model
that combines MNRL with CosineSimilarityLoss to improve both semantic ranking
and similarity calibration. Evaluations were conducted on 28 university course
syllabi using a fixed set of natural language questions categorized into
course, faculty, and teaching assistant information. Results demonstrate that
both fine-tuned models outperform strong open-source baselines, including
all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1, and that the dual-loss model
narrows the performance gap with high-performing proprietary embeddings such as
OpenAI's text-embedding-3 series. This work contributes reusable,
domain-aligned embedding models and provides a replicable framework for
educational semantic retrieval, supporting downstream applications such as
academic chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and learning
management system (LMS) integrations.

Motivation: 探索CoT在大型语言模型中的内部机制，尤其是在解决复杂推理任务时的作用。

Method: 在组合任务（多位数乘法和动态规划）中实证研究CoT令牌的作用，包括保留中间结果令牌和干预CoT值。

Result: 仅保留中间结果令牌即可达到类似性能；中间结果可以以潜在形式存储；干预CoT值会影响后续令牌和答案。

Conclusion: CoT令牌可能类似程序变量，但存在潜在缺陷如意外捷径和计算复杂度限制。

Abstract: Chain-of-thoughts (CoT) requires large language models (LLMs) to generate
intermediate steps before reaching the final answer, and has been proven
effective to help LLMs solve complex reasoning tasks. However, the inner
mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically
study the role of CoT tokens in LLMs on two compositional tasks: multi-digit
multiplication and dynamic programming. While CoT is essential for solving
these problems, we find that preserving only tokens that store intermediate
results would achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we observe that
storing intermediate results in an alternative latent form will not affect
model performance. We also randomly intervene some values in CoT, and notice
that subsequent CoT tokens and the final answer would change correspondingly.
These findings suggest that CoT tokens may function like variables in computer
programs but with potential drawbacks like unintended shortcuts and
computational complexity limits between tokens. The code and data are available
at https://github.com/solitaryzero/CoTs_are_Variables.

Result: 假设在句法结构中不成立，且难以推广到儿童语言和动物信号。

Conclusion: 需重新评估幂律与层次结构的关系，现有解释可能不适用。

Abstract: Statistical analysis of corpora provides an approach to quantitatively
investigate natural languages. This approach has revealed that several power
laws consistently emerge across different corpora and languages, suggesting the
universal principles underlying languages. Particularly, the power-law decay of
correlation has been interpreted as evidence for underlying hierarchical
structures in syntax, semantics, and discourse. This perspective has also been
extended to child languages and animal signals. However, the argument
supporting this interpretation has not been empirically tested. To address this
problem, this study examines the validity of the argument for syntactic
structures. Specifically, we test whether the statistical properties of parse
trees align with the implicit assumptions in the argument. Using English
corpora, we analyze the mutual information, deviations from probabilistic
context-free grammars (PCFGs), and other properties in parse trees, as well as
in the PCFG that approximates these trees. Our results indicate that the
assumptions do not hold for syntactic structures and that it is difficult to
apply the proposed argument to child languages and animal signals, highlighting
the need to reconsider the relationship between the power law and hierarchical
structures.

Motivation: 现有偏好建模方法通常依赖显式或隐式奖励函数，忽视了人类偏好的复杂性和多面性。LPC旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: LPC通过离散潜在代码建模偏好的隐含因素及其组合，无需预定义奖励函数或手工权重，可无缝集成到多种离线对齐算法中。

Result: 实验证明LPC在三种对齐算法（DPO、SimPO、IPO）和三种基础模型（Mistral-7B、Llama3-8B、Llama3-8B-Instruct）上均表现优异，且潜在代码能有效捕捉人类偏好分布差异并增强对齐的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LPC为多面偏好因素提供了统一表示，为开发更鲁棒和通用的对齐技术铺平了道路，有助于LLM的负责任部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet aligning
their generations with human preferences remains a critical challenge. Existing
approaches to preference modeling often rely on an explicit or implicit reward
function, overlooking the intricate and multifaceted nature of human
preferences that may encompass conflicting factors across diverse tasks and
populations. To address this limitation, we introduce Latent Preference Coding
(LPC), a novel framework that models the implicit factors as well as their
combinations behind holistic preferences using discrete latent codes. LPC
seamlessly integrates with various offline alignment algorithms, automatically
inferring the underlying factors and their importance from data without relying
on pre-defined reward functions and hand-crafted combination weights. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LPC consistently improves
upon three alignment algorithms (DPO, SimPO, and IPO) using three base models
(Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3-8B-Instruct). Furthermore, deeper analysis
reveals that the learned latent codes effectively capture the differences in
the distribution of human preferences and significantly enhance the robustness
of alignment against noise in data. By providing a unified representation for
the multifarious preference factors, LPC paves the way towards developing more
robust and versatile alignment techniques for the responsible deployment of
powerful LLMs.

Motivation: 现有ICL方法对上下文示例顺序敏感，且缺乏同时满足信息不泄漏和上下文互依赖性的算法。

Result: InvICL在多数基准数据集上优于现有方法，表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: InvICL通过同时满足两个关键设计要素，显著提升了ICL的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a pivotal capability of
auto-regressive large language models, yet it is hindered by a notable
sensitivity to the ordering of context examples regardless of their mutual
independence. To address this issue, recent studies have introduced several
variant algorithms of ICL that achieve permutation invariance. However, many of
these do not exhibit comparable performance with the standard auto-regressive
ICL algorithm. In this work, we identify two crucial elements in the design of
an invariant ICL algorithm: information non-leakage and context
interdependence, which are not simultaneously achieved by any of the existing
methods. These investigations lead us to the proposed Invariant ICL (InvICL), a
methodology designed to achieve invariance in ICL while ensuring the two
properties. Empirically, our findings reveal that InvICL surpasses previous
models, both invariant and non-invariant, in most benchmark datasets,
showcasing superior generalization capabilities across varying input lengths.

Method: 通过实验分析不同语言模型、提示条件（如上下文学习、解释生成）和群体偏好格式对准确性的影响。

Conclusion: 未来研究应考虑群体复杂性对模型性能的影响，小模型在适当条件下也能生成群体推荐，节省计算资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in recommender systems
aimed at both individuals and groups. Previously, Group Recommender Systems
(GRS) often used social choice-based aggregation strategies to derive a single
recommendation based on the preferences of multiple people. In this paper, we
investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies
correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the
group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the
impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs,
different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating
explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that
performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings.
However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group
complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can
significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity,
while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting
for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research
should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect
on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios
differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy. All
in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group
recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller
models that require less computing power and costs.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are commonly fine-tuned to adapt to
downstream tasks. Since the majority of knowledge is acquired during
pre-training, attributing the predictions of fine-tuned LLMs to their
pre-training data may provide valuable insights. Influence functions have been
proposed as a means to explain model predictions based on training data.
However, existing approaches fail to compute ``multi-stage'' influence and lack
scalability to billion-scale LLMs.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-stage influence function to attribute the
downstream predictions of fine-tuned LLMs to pre-training data under the
full-parameter fine-tuning paradigm. To enhance the efficiency and practicality
of our multi-stage influence function, we leverage Eigenvalue-corrected
Kronecker-Factored (EK-FAC) parameterization for efficient approximation.
Empirical results validate the superior scalability of EK-FAC approximation and
the effectiveness of our multi-stage influence function. Additionally, case

*Jaehyun Jeon,Janghan Yoon,Minsoo Kim,Sumin Shim,Yejin Choi,Hanbin Kim,Youngjae Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了WiserUI-Bench基准和G-FOCUS推理策略，用于评估UI设计的说服力，旨在替代昂贵的A/B测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A/B测试成本高且耗时，现有视觉语言模型（VLM）方法未能有效比较UI设计的说服力。

Method: 引入WiserUI-Bench基准和G-FOCUS推理策略，通过减少位置偏差提高评估准确性。

Result: G-FOCUS在一致性和准确性上优于现有推理策略。

Conclusion: 该工作为UI设计优化提供了可扩展的替代方案，推动了UI偏好建模的进展。

Abstract: Evaluating user interface (UI) design effectiveness extends beyond aesthetics
to influencing user behavior, a principle central to Design Persuasiveness. A/B
testing is the predominant method for determining which UI variations drive
higher user engagement, but it is costly and time-consuming. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process automated UI analysis, current
approaches focus on isolated design attributes rather than comparative
persuasiveness-the key factor in optimizing user interactions. To address this,
we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a benchmark designed for Pairwise UI Design
Persuasiveness Assessment task, featuring 300 real-world UI image pairs labeled
with A/B test results and expert rationales. Additionally, we propose G-FOCUS,
a novel inference-time reasoning strategy that enhances VLM-based
persuasiveness assessment by reducing position bias and improving evaluation
accuracy. Experimental results show that G-FOCUS surpasses existing inference
strategies in consistency and accuracy for pairwise UI evaluation. Through
promoting VLM-driven evaluation of UI persuasiveness, our work offers an
approach to complement A/B testing, propelling progress in scalable UI
preference modeling and design optimization. Code and data will be released
publicly.

Twitter posts in Latvian along with their manual translations into English. We
compare our results to previous work and show that the more recently released
vision-language model checkpoints are becoming increasingly capable at this
task, but there is still much room for further improvement.

Motivation: 孟加拉语作为低资源语言，其消费者健康查询常含冗余信息，需高效摘要以改善医疗响应。

Method: 使用BanglaCHQ-Summ数据集（2,350对查询-摘要），通过ROUGE指标比较九种LLMs与微调模型Bangla T5的零样本表现。

Result: Mixtral-8x22b-Instruct在ROUGE-1和ROUGE-L中表现最佳，Bangla T5在ROUGE-2中领先，零样本LLMs可媲美微调模型。

Conclusion: 零样本LLMs在低资源语言任务中潜力巨大，为医疗查询摘要提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Consumer Health Queries (CHQs) in Bengali (Bangla), a low-resource language,
often contain extraneous details, complicating efficient medical responses.
This study investigates the zero-shot performance of nine advanced large
language models (LLMs): GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Claude-3.5-Sonnet,
Llama3-70b-Instruct, Mixtral-8x22b-Instruct, Gemini-1.5-Pro,
Qwen2-72b-Instruct, Gemma-2-27b, and Athene-70B, in summarizing Bangla CHQs.
Using the BanglaCHQ-Summ dataset comprising 2,350 annotated query-summary
pairs, we benchmarked these LLMs using ROUGE metrics against Bangla T5, a
fine-tuned state-of-the-art model. Mixtral-8x22b-Instruct emerged as the top
performing model in ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L, while Bangla T5 excelled in ROUGE-2.
The results demonstrate that zero-shot LLMs can rival fine-tuned models,
achieving high-quality summaries even without task-specific training. This work
underscores the potential of LLMs in addressing challenges in low-resource
languages, providing scalable solutions for healthcare query summarization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展引发了对其被恶意滥用的担忧，现有检测方法过于关注准确性而忽视了高假阳性率的社会风险。

Method: 利用共形预测（CP）约束假阳性率上限，并提出多尺度共形预测（MCP）框架，结合高质量数据集RealDet，提升检测性能。

Result: 实证评估表明，MCP有效约束假阳性率，显著提升检测性能，并增强了对对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MCP框架在约束假阳性率和提升检测性能方面表现优异，为机器生成文本检测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has raised significant
concerns regarding their potential misuse by malicious actors. As a result,
developing effective detectors to mitigate these risks has become a critical
priority. However, most existing detection methods focus excessively on
detection accuracy, often neglecting the societal risks posed by high false
positive rates (FPRs). This paper addresses this issue by leveraging Conformal
Prediction (CP), which effectively constrains the upper bound of FPRs. While
directly applying CP constrains FPRs, it also leads to a significant reduction
in detection performance. To overcome this trade-off, this paper proposes a
Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection Framework via Multiscaled Conformal
Prediction (MCP), which both enforces the FPR constraint and improves detection
performance. This paper also introduces RealDet, a high-quality dataset that
spans a wide range of domains, ensuring realistic calibration and enabling
superior detection performance when combined with MCP. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that MCP effectively constrains FPRs, significantly enhances
detection performance, and increases robustness against adversarial attacks
across multiple detectors and datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）多语言能力的机制，提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAE）的新方法，并发现了一些语言特异性特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如基于神经元或内部激活的方法）在多语言能力分析中存在局限性（如叠加和层间激活差异），需要更可靠的分析工具。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）分解LLM的激活，提出了一种新指标评估特征的单一语言性，并通过特征消融实验验证其影响。

Result: 发现某些SAE特征与特定语言强相关，消融这些特征仅显著影响一种语言能力；还发现某些语言存在协同特征，联合消融效果更显著。此外，利用这些特征改进了语言生成控制。

Conclusion: SAE为分析LLM多语言能力提供了更精细的工具，语言特异性特征可用于增强模型的语言控制能力。

Abstract: The mechanisms behind multilingual capabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been examined using neuron-based or internal-activation-based
methods. However, these methods often face challenges such as superposition and
layer-wise activation variance, which limit their reliability. Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) offer a more nuanced analysis by decomposing the
activations of LLMs into sparse linear combination of SAE features. We
introduce a novel metric to assess the monolinguality of features obtained from
SAEs, discovering that some features are strongly related to specific
languages. Additionally, we show that ablating these SAE features only
significantly reduces abilities in one language of LLMs, leaving others almost
unaffected. Interestingly, we find some languages have multiple synergistic SAE
features, and ablating them together yields greater improvement than ablating
individually. Moreover, we leverage these SAE-derived language-specific
features to enhance steering vectors, achieving control over the language
generated by LLMs.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言Urdu在多模态命名实体识别领域缺乏标注数据和标准化基线的问题。

Method: 提出U-MNER框架，结合Urdu-BERT文本嵌入和ResNet视觉特征提取，通过跨模态融合模块整合信息。

Result: 模型在Twitter2015-Urdu数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 为低资源语言的MNER研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal content, particularly text and images on social
media, has positioned Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) as an
increasingly important area of research within Natural Language Processing.
Despite progress in high-resource languages such as English, MNER remains
underexplored for low-resource languages like Urdu. The primary challenges
include the scarcity of annotated multimodal datasets and the lack of
standardized baselines. To address these challenges, we introduce the U-MNER
framework and release the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, a pioneering resource for
Urdu MNER. Adapted from the widely used Twitter2015 dataset, it is annotated
with Urdu-specific grammar rules. We establish benchmark baselines by
evaluating both text-based and multimodal models on this dataset, providing
comparative analyses to support future research on Urdu MNER. The U-MNER
framework integrates textual and visual context using Urdu-BERT for text
embeddings and ResNet for visual feature extraction, with a Cross-Modal Fusion
Module to align and fuse information. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, laying the groundwork for further
MNER research in low-resource languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在垂直领域覆盖不足且缺乏中文工作场景的针对性评估，需填补这一空白。

Method: 利用资格考试作为统一框架，构建QualBench数据集，评估中文LLM在本地化知识上的表现。

Result: Qwen2.5模型表现优于GPT-4o，中文LLM整体优于非中文模型，最佳成绩为75.26%，显示领域覆盖仍有不足。

Conclusion: 需通过多领域RAG知识增强和联邦学习优化垂直领域LLM训练，同时LLM与众包机制协作存在挑战。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Chinese large language models (LLMs) underscores the
need for domain-specific evaluations to ensure reliable applications. However,
existing benchmarks often lack coverage in vertical domains and offer limited
insights into the Chinese working context. Leveraging qualification exams as a
unified framework for human expertise evaluation, we introduce QualBench, the
first multi-domain Chinese QA benchmark dedicated to localized assessment of
Chinese LLMs. The dataset includes over 17,000 questions across six vertical
domains, with data selections grounded in 24 Chinese qualifications to closely
align with national policies and working standards. Through comprehensive
evaluation, the Qwen2.5 model outperformed the more advanced GPT-4o, with
Chinese LLMs consistently surpassing non-Chinese models, highlighting the
importance of localized domain knowledge in meeting qualification requirements.
The best performance of 75.26% reveals the current gaps in domain coverage
within model capabilities. Furthermore, we present the failure of LLM
collaboration with crowdsourcing mechanisms and suggest the opportunities for
multi-domain RAG knowledge enhancement and vertical domain LLM training with
Federated Learning.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的表格标记方法（T-T），用于解决ASTE任务中的长序列和局部注意力问题，通过条纹注意力和循环移位策略实现高效关系学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉标记表中词间关系时能力有限，而Transformer的语义建模能力强大，但直接使用会面临长序列和不公平局部注意力问题。

Method: 提出T-T方法，结合条纹注意力机制和循环移位策略，优化Transformer的全局注意力为局部窗口，并促进窗口间交互。

Result: 实验表明，T-T在计算成本更低的情况下，实现了ASTE任务的最高性能。

Conclusion: T-T通过改进Transformer的注意力机制，有效解决了ASTE任务中的挑战，成为高效的关系学习模块。

Abstract: Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) aims to extract triplets composed
of aspect terms, opinion terms, and sentiment polarities from given sentences.
The table tagging method is a popular approach to addressing this task, which
encodes a sentence into a 2-dimensional table, allowing for the tagging of
relations between any two words. Previous efforts have focused on designing
various downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions
between tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture
relations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we
attempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning
modules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it
is foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to
the quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the
input sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges:
overly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the
tagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention
mechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former
modifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local
attention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different
attention windows. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the
T-T, as a downstream relation learning module, achieves state-of-the-art
performance with lower computational costs.

Abstract: In this position paper, we advocate for the development of conversational
technology that is inherently designed to support and facilitate argumentative
processes. We argue that, at present, large language models (LLMs) are
inadequate for this purpose, and we propose an ideal technology design aimed at
enhancing argumentative skills. This involves re-framing LLMs as tools to
exercise our critical thinking rather than replacing them. We introduce the
concept of 'reasonable parrots' that embody the fundamental principles of
relevance, responsibility, and freedom, and that interact through argumentative
dialogical moves. These principles and moves arise out of millennia of work in
argumentation theory and should serve as the starting point for LLM-based
technology that incorporates basic principles of argumentation.

Conclusion: ICon提供了一种高效、无偏的数据选择方法，所选样本兼具任务多样性和适当难度。

Abstract: Data selection for instruction tuning is essential for improving the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and reducing training cost.
However, existing automated selection methods either depend on computationally
expensive gradient-based measures or manually designed heuristics, which may
fail to fully exploit the intrinsic attributes of data. In this paper, we
propose In-context Learning for Contribution Measurement (ICon), a novel
gradient-free method that takes advantage of the implicit fine-tuning nature of
in-context learning (ICL) to measure sample contribution without gradient
computation or manual indicators engineering. ICon offers a computationally
efficient alternative to gradient-based methods and reduces human inductive
bias inherent in heuristic-based approaches. ICon comprises three components
and identifies high-contribution data by assessing performance shifts under
implicit learning through ICL. Extensive experiments on three LLMs across 12
benchmarks and 5 pairwise evaluation sets demonstrate the effectiveness of
ICon. Remarkably, on LLaMA3.1-8B, models trained on 15% of ICon-selected data
outperform full datasets by 5.42% points and exceed the best performance of
widely used selection methods by 2.06% points. We further analyze
high-contribution samples selected by ICon, which show both diverse tasks and
appropriate difficulty levels, rather than just the hardest ones.

Result: LLM在敏感话题中表现出更明显的框架偏见，且不同模型间差异显著。

Conclusion: 需开发有效的后训练缓解策略和更严格的评估框架，以确保自动化新闻内容的平衡性。

Abstract: Framing in media critically shapes public perception by selectively
emphasizing some details while downplaying others. With the rise of large
language models in automated news and content creation, there is growing
concern that these systems may introduce or even amplify framing biases
compared to human authors. In this paper, we explore how framing manifests in
both out-of-the-box and fine-tuned LLM-generated news content. Our analysis
reveals that, particularly in politically and socially sensitive contexts, LLMs
tend to exhibit more pronounced framing than their human counterparts. In
addition, we observe significant variation in framing tendencies across
different model architectures, with some models displaying notably higher
biases. These findings point to the need for effective post-training mitigation
strategies and tighter evaluation frameworks to ensure that automated news
content upholds the standards of balanced reporting.

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities of large language models are primarily studied for
English, even when pretrained models are multilingual. In this work, we
investigate to what extent English reasoning finetuning with long
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) can generalize across languages. First, we find that
scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models
(RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages
including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models
twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are
naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think
pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an
effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we
observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource
languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in
particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English.
Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the
limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time
scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason
in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning
in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts.

Motivation: 研究CoT是否能忠实反映模型的推理过程，以评估其在AI安全性中的潜力。

Method: 测试了6种推理提示下CoT的忠实性，并分析了强化学习对CoT效果的影响。

Result: CoT揭示提示使用的比例通常低于20%，强化学习虽能提升忠实性但效果有限。

Conclusion: CoT监控虽有用，但不足以可靠检测罕见或灾难性意外行为。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) offers a potential boon for AI safety as it allows
monitoring a model's CoT to try to understand its intentions and reasoning
processes. However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs
faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT
faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints
presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested,
CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the
hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement
learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and
(3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward
hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without
training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a
promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations,
but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in
settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring
of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected
behaviors.

TLDR: 论文提出TransProQA，一种基于LLM的无参考QA框架，专注于文学翻译评估，优于现有指标，接近人类评估水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标过于注重机械准确性，忽视艺术表达，可能导致翻译质量和文化真实性的长期下降。

Method: 引入TransProQA，整合专业译者和研究者的见解，评估文学质量的关键元素（如文学手法、文化理解和作者声音）。

Result: TransProQA显著优于现有指标，相关性提升0.07，在充分性评估中超过SOTA指标15分以上，接近人类评估水平。

Conclusion: TransProQA是一种高效、无需训练的文学评估工具，适用于开源模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary
domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy
over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being
superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this
bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural
authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary
evaluation metric, we introduce TransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based
question-answering (QA) framework designed specifically for literary
translation evaluation. TransProQA uniquely integrates insights from
professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical
elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural
understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while
literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, TransProQA substantially
outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ
and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics by
over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator
insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of
translator inputs. Notably, TransProQA approaches human-level evaluation
performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad
applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b,
indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation
metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing
due to copyright or ethical considerations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的发展，数据质量成为关键因素，但现有方法在数据验证和种子数据选择上存在效率低和主观性强的问题。

Method: 引入高效验证策略和优化种子数据选择，构建基于fastText的轻量级分类器，形成高效数据过滤流程。

Result: 应用于FineWeb和Chinese FineWeb数据集，生成了更高质量的Ultra-FineWeb数据集，显著提升了LLM在多个基准任务上的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅提高了数据质量和训练效率，还降低了实验和推理成本，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Data quality has become a key factor in enhancing model performance with the
rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Model-driven data filtering
has increasingly become a primary approach for acquiring high-quality data.
However, it still faces two main challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient data
verification strategy makes it difficult to provide timely feedback on data
quality; and (2) the selection of seed data for training classifiers lacks
clear criteria and relies heavily on human expertise, introducing a degree of
subjectivity. To address the first challenge, we introduce an efficient
verification strategy that enables rapid evaluation of the impact of data on
LLM training with minimal computational cost. To tackle the second challenge,
we build upon the assumption that high-quality seed data is beneficial for LLM
training, and by integrating the proposed verification strategy, we optimize
the selection of positive and negative samples and propose an efficient data
filtering pipeline. This pipeline not only improves filtering efficiency,
classifier quality, and robustness, but also significantly reduces experimental
and inference costs. In addition, to efficiently filter high-quality data, we
employ a lightweight classifier based on fastText, and successfully apply the
filtering pipeline to two widely-used pre-training corpora, FineWeb and Chinese
FineWeb datasets, resulting in the creation of the higher-quality Ultra-FineWeb
dataset. Ultra-FineWeb contains approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120
billion Chinese tokens. Empirical results demonstrate that the LLMs trained on
Ultra-FineWeb exhibit significant performance improvements across multiple
benchmark tasks, validating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing both
data quality and training efficiency.

Abstract: The emergence of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) has advanced
the field of dialogue systems, enabling both realistic user simulations and
robust multi-turn conversational agents. However, existing research often
evaluates these components in isolation-either focusing on a single user
simulator or a specific system design-limiting the generalisability of insights
across architectures and configurations. In this work, we propose clem todd
(chat-optimized LLMs for task-oriented dialogue systems development), a
flexible framework for systematically evaluating dialogue systems under
consistent conditions. clem todd enables detailed benchmarking across
combinations of user simulators and dialogue systems, whether existing models
from literature or newly developed ones. It supports plug-and-play integration
and ensures uniform datasets, evaluation metrics, and computational
constraints. We showcase clem todd's flexibility by re-evaluating existing
task-oriented dialogue systems within this unified setup and integrating three
newly proposed dialogue systems into the same evaluation pipeline. Our results
provide actionable insights into how architecture, scale, and prompting
strategies affect dialogue performance, offering practical guidance for
building efficient and effective conversational AI systems.

Conclusion: 模型合并是跨模态整合和模型解释的有效工具，揭示了感知与推理的层间分布规律。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine visual perception with the general
capabilities, such as reasoning, of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
mechanisms by which these two abilities can be combined and contribute remain
poorly understood. In this work, we explore to compose perception and reasoning
through model merging that connects parameters of different models. Unlike
previous works that often focus on merging models of the same kind, we propose
merging models across modalities, enabling the incorporation of the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs into VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate
that model merging offers a successful pathway to transfer reasoning abilities
from LLMs to VLMs in a training-free manner. Moreover, we utilize the merged
models to understand the internal mechanism of perception and reasoning and how
merging affects it. We find that perception capabilities are predominantly
encoded in the early layers of the model, whereas reasoning is largely
facilitated by the middle-to-late layers. After merging, we observe that all
layers begin to contribute to reasoning, whereas the distribution of perception
abilities across layers remains largely unchanged. These observations shed
light on the potential of model merging as a tool for multimodal integration
and interpretation.

Motivation: 现有直接对齐方法存在冗长和似然位移问题，尤其是在噪声偏好对的情况下，需要设计更有效的方法。

Method: 提出基于比较预言机的偏好对齐方法，并提供收敛保证；进一步通过启发式方法改进，并在多个模型和基准上实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在Mistral-7B、Llama-3-8B和Gemma-2-9B等模型上有效，优于现有直接对齐方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为噪声偏好对提供了有效的对齐方案，并强调了设计针对不同似然边际的专用方法的重要性。

Abstract: Direct alignment methods are increasingly used for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, these methods suffer from the
issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the
noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and
dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we
propose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and
provide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our
method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the
flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance
of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple
base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with
benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show
the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations
of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we
evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs
with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in
\citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏针对皮肤组织的标注数据集和开源分析工具，特别是在cSCC领域。

Method: 利用卷积神经网络和视觉变换器，对47,392个标注细胞核和144个肿瘤分割WSI进行分析，生成特征向量。

Result: 模型性能优异，核分割mPQ为0.569，核分类F1为0.832，肿瘤分割mIoU为0.884。特征向量成功预测了45名患者的免疫疗法反应。

Conclusion: Histo-Miner在临床场景中具有实用性，为治疗反应提供了生物学解释。

Abstract: Recent advancements in digital pathology have enabled comprehensive analysis
of Whole-Slide Images (WSI) from tissue samples, leveraging high-resolution
microscopy and computational capabilities. Despite this progress, there is a
lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for
analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based
pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled
nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient
samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma
skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell
nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients,
Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for
nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation.
Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with
multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation,
macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection
over Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these
predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology
and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks.
Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy
based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies
percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor
vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as
predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of
Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation
of the classification and insights into the underlying biology.

Motivation: 近年来，深度学习模型和数据资源的进步推动了人体姿态估计的发展，但其在生物力学分析（如短跑）中的性能仍需验证和改进。

Method: 研究比较了两种点跟踪器和四种关节跟踪器在5870帧数据上的表现，结合专家手动标注，提出后处理模块用于异常检测和融合预测。

Result: 实验显示，基于关节的模型误差范围为11.41°至4.37°，后处理模块可进一步降低至6.99°和3.88°。

Conclusion: 人体姿态跟踪方法在短跑生物力学分析中具有价值，但在高精度需求场景仍需改进。

Abstract: Human pose estimation has witnessed significant advancements in recent years,
mainly due to the integration of deep learning models, the availability of a
vast amount of data, and large computational resources. These developments have
led to highly accurate body tracking systems, which have direct applications in
sports analysis and performance evaluation.
  This work analyzes the performance of six trackers: two point trackers and
four joint trackers for biomechanical analysis in sprints. The proposed
framework compares the results obtained from these pose trackers with the
manual annotations of biomechanical experts for more than 5870 frames. The
experimental framework employs forty sprints from five professional runners,
focusing on three key angles in sprint biomechanics: trunk inclination, hip
flex extension, and knee flex extension. We propose a post-processing module
for outlier detection and fusion prediction in the joint angles.
  The experimental results demonstrate that using joint-based models yields
root mean squared errors ranging from 11.41{\deg} to 4.37{\deg}. When
integrated with the post-processing modules, these errors can be reduced to
6.99{\deg} and 3.88{\deg}, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that
human pose tracking approaches can be valuable resources for the biomechanical
analysis of running. However, there is still room for improvement in
applications where high accuracy is required.

Conclusion: LayouSyn不仅性能优越，还可与大型语言模型结合优化结果，并在图像编辑应用中展示了潜力。

Abstract: We present Lay-Your-Scene (shorthand LayouSyn), a novel text-to-layout
generation pipeline for natural scenes. Prior scene layout generation methods
are either closed-vocabulary or use proprietary large language models for
open-vocabulary generation, limiting their modeling capabilities and broader
applicability in controllable image generation. In this work, we propose to use
lightweight open-source language models to obtain scene elements from text
prompts and a novel aspect-aware diffusion Transformer architecture trained in
an open-vocabulary manner for conditional layout generation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LayouSyn outperforms existing methods and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on challenging spatial and numerical reasoning
benchmarks. Additionally, we present two applications of LayouSyn. First, we
show that coarse initialization from large language models can be seamlessly
combined with our method to achieve better results. Second, we present a
pipeline for adding objects to images, demonstrating the potential of LayouSyn
in image editing applications.

Abstract: Performance comparisons are fundamental in medical imaging Artificial
Intelligence (AI) research, often driving claims of superiority based on
relative improvements in common performance metrics. However, such claims
frequently rely solely on empirical mean performance. In this paper, we
investigate whether newly proposed methods genuinely outperform the state of
the art by analyzing a representative cohort of medical imaging papers. We
quantify the probability of false claims based on a Bayesian approach that
leverages reported results alongside empirically estimated model congruence to
estimate whether the relative ranking of methods is likely to have occurred by
chance. According to our results, the majority (>80%) of papers claims
outperformance when introducing a new method. Our analysis further revealed a
high probability (>5%) of false outperformance claims in 86% of classification
papers and 53% of segmentation papers. These findings highlight a critical flaw
in current benchmarking practices: claims of outperformance in medical imaging
AI are frequently unsubstantiated, posing a risk of misdirecting future
research efforts.

Abstract: This study addresses the inherent limitations of Multi-Layer Perceptrons
(MLPs) in Vision Transformers (ViTs) by introducing Hybrid Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network (KAN)-ViT (Hyb-KAN ViT), a novel framework that integrates
wavelet-based spectral decomposition and spline-optimized activation functions,
prior work has failed to focus on the prebuilt modularity of the ViT
architecture and integration of edge detection capabilities of Wavelet
functions. We propose two key modules: Efficient-KAN (Eff-KAN), which replaces
MLP layers with spline functions and Wavelet-KAN (Wav-KAN), leveraging
orthogonal wavelet transforms for multi-resolution feature extraction. These
modules are systematically integrated in ViT encoder layers and classification
heads to enhance spatial-frequency modeling while mitigating computational
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K (Image Recognition), COCO (Object
Detection and Instance Segmentation), and ADE20K (Semantic Segmentation)
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with Hyb-KAN ViT. Ablation studies
validate the efficacy of wavelet-driven spectral priors in segmentation and
spline-based efficiency in detection tasks. The framework establishes a new
paradigm for balancing parameter efficiency and multi-scale representation in
vision architectures.

Motivation: 现有RGB-D方法要么牺牲效率使用大型骨干网络，要么轻量级方法难以实现高精度。

Method: 引入Depth Anything Model提升深度质量；提出解耦注意力模块（DAM）探索模态一致性；开发双向信息表示模块（DIRM）扩展特征空间；设计双特征聚合模块（DFAM）融合特征。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上表现优于现有CNN重型模型，参数仅5.2 M，速度达415 FPS。

Conclusion: SATNet在轻量级框架下实现了高效与高精度的平衡。

Abstract: Current RGB-D methods usually leverage large-scale backbones to improve
accuracy but sacrifice efficiency. Meanwhile, several existing lightweight
methods are difficult to achieve high-precision performance. To balance the
efficiency and performance, we propose a Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff Network
(SATNet) for Lightweight RGB-D SOD from three fundamental perspectives: depth
quality, modality fusion, and feature representation. Concerning depth quality,
we introduce the Depth Anything Model to generate high-quality depth maps,which
effectively alleviates the multi-modal gaps in the current datasets. For
modality fusion, we propose a Decoupled Attention Module (DAM) to explore the
consistency within and between modalities. Here, the multi-modal features are
decoupled into dual-view feature vectors to project discriminable information
of feature maps. For feature representation, we develop a Dual Information
Representation Module (DIRM) with a bi-directional inverted framework to
enlarge the limited feature space generated by the lightweight backbones. DIRM
models texture features and saliency features to enrich feature space, and
employ two-way prediction heads to optimal its parameters through a
bi-directional backpropagation. Finally, we design a Dual Feature Aggregation
Module (DFAM) in the decoder to aggregate texture and saliency features.
Extensive experiments on five public RGB-D SOD datasets indicate that the
proposed SATNet excels state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNN-based heavyweight models and
achieves a lightweight framework with 5.2 M parameters and 415 FPS.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models mark a transformative advancement in
artificial intelligence, aiming to unify perception, natural language
understanding, and embodied action within a single computational framework.
This foundational review presents a comprehensive synthesis of recent
advancements in Vision-Language-Action models, systematically organized across
five thematic pillars that structure the landscape of this rapidly evolving
field. We begin by establishing the conceptual foundations of VLA systems,
tracing their evolution from cross-modal learning architectures to generalist
agents that tightly integrate vision-language models (VLMs), action planners,
and hierarchical controllers. Our methodology adopts a rigorous literature
review framework, covering over 80 VLA models published in the past three
years. Key progress areas include architectural innovations,
parameter-efficient training strategies, and real-time inference accelerations.
We explore diverse application domains such as humanoid robotics, autonomous
vehicles, medical and industrial robotics, precision agriculture, and augmented
reality navigation. The review further addresses major challenges across
real-time control, multimodal action representation, system scalability,
generalization to unseen tasks, and ethical deployment risks. Drawing from the
state-of-the-art, we propose targeted solutions including agentic AI
adaptation, cross-embodiment generalization, and unified neuro-symbolic
planning. In our forward-looking discussion, we outline a future roadmap where
VLA models, VLMs, and agentic AI converge to power socially aligned, adaptive,
and general-purpose embodied agents. This work serves as a foundational

Method: 使用生成回放模块和基于聚类的动态阈值不确定性估计，结合VLM生成合成数据。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等数据集上表现优异，最高提升4.36%。

Conclusion: R2R框架显著提升了知识保留能力，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Continual Learning entails progressively acquiring knowledge from new data
while retaining previously acquired knowledge, thereby mitigating
``Catastrophic Forgetting'' in neural networks. Our work presents a novel
uncertainty-driven Unsupervised Continual Learning framework using Generative
Replay, namely ``Replay to Remember (R2R)''. The proposed R2R architecture
efficiently uses unlabelled and synthetic labelled data in a balanced
proportion using a cluster-level uncertainty-driven feedback mechanism and a
VLM-powered generative replay module. Unlike traditional memory-buffer methods
that depend on pretrained models and pseudo-labels, our R2R framework operates
without any prior training. It leverages visual features from unlabeled data
and adapts continuously using clustering-based uncertainty estimation coupled
with dynamic thresholding. Concurrently, a generative replay mechanism along
with DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM produces labelled synthetic data
representative of past experiences, resembling biological visual thinking that
replays memory to remember and act in new, unseen tasks. Extensive experimental
analyses are carried out in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, SVHN and
TinyImageNet datasets. Our proposed R2R approach improves knowledge retention,
achieving a state-of-the-art performance of 98.13%, 73.06%, 93.41%, 95.18%,
59.74%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art performance by over 4.36%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么是次优求解器，要么追求全局最优但计算成本高，因此需要一种更高效且全局最优的解决方案。

Method: 采用“软”关联方案和截断多选择误差，将问题转化为QCQP，再松弛为凸SDP问题，并通过迭代求解器GlobustVP独立更新每个VP及其关联线。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上的实验表明，GlobustVP在效率、鲁棒性和全局最优性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GlobustVP提供了一种高效且全局最优的解决方案，适用于曼哈顿世界中的消失点估计问题。

Abstract: Determining the vanishing points (VPs) in a Manhattan world, as a fundamental
task in many 3D vision applications, consists of jointly inferring the line-VP
association and locating each VP. Existing methods are, however, either
sub-optimal solvers or pursuing global optimality at a significant cost of
computing time. In contrast to prior works, we introduce convex relaxation
techniques to solve this task for the first time. Specifically, we employ a
``soft'' association scheme, realized via a truncated multi-selection error,
that allows for joint estimation of VPs' locations and line-VP associations.
This approach leads to a primal problem that can be reformulated into a
quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which is then
relaxed into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To solve this SDP
problem efficiently, we present a globally optimal outlier-robust iterative
solver (called \textbf{GlobustVP}), which independently searches for one VP and
its associated lines in each iteration, treating other lines as outliers. After
each independent update of all VPs, the mutual orthogonality between the three
VPs in a Manhattan world is reinforced via local refinement. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that
\textbf{GlobustVP} achieves a favorable balance between efficiency, robustness,
and global optimality compared to previous works. The code is publicly

TLDR: DetReIDX是一个大规模无人机-地面行人数据集，旨在测试真实场景下的行人重识别技术，包含多会话、多变量数据，显著降低了现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行人重识别技术在真实场景中表现不佳，公开数据集缺乏真实变异性，限制了技术进步。

Method: 引入DetReIDX数据集，包含多会话、多变量数据（如服装、光照变化），并标注了多种任务标签。

Result: 现有方法在DetReIDX条件下性能显著下降（检测精度下降80%，Rank-1 ReID下降70%）。

Conclusion: DetReIDX为真实场景下的行人重识别提供了更严格的测试基准，数据集公开可用。

Abstract: Person reidentification (ReID) technology has been considered to perform
relatively well under controlled, ground-level conditions, but it breaks down
when deployed in challenging real-world settings. Evidently, this is due to
extreme data variability factors such as resolution, viewpoint changes, scale
variations, occlusions, and appearance shifts from clothing or session drifts.
Moreover, the publicly available data sets do not realistically incorporate
such kinds and magnitudes of variability, which limits the progress of this
technology. This paper introduces DetReIDX, a large-scale aerial-ground person
dataset, that was explicitly designed as a stress test to ReID under real-world
conditions. DetReIDX is a multi-session set that includes over 13 million
bounding boxes from 509 identities, collected in seven university campuses from
three continents, with drone altitudes between 5.8 and 120 meters. More
important, as a key novelty, DetReIDX subjects were recorded in (at least) two
sessions on different days, with changes in clothing, daylight and location,
making it suitable to actually evaluate long-term person ReID. Plus, data were
annotated from 16 soft biometric attributes and multitask labels for detection,
tracking, ReID, and action recognition. In order to provide empirical evidence
of DetReIDX usefulness, we considered the specific tasks of human detection and
ReID, where SOTA methods catastrophically degrade performance (up to 80% in
detection accuracy and over 70% in Rank-1 ReID) when exposed to DetReIDXs
conditions. The dataset, annotations, and official evaluation protocols are
publicly available at https://www.it.ubi.pt/DetReIDX/

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models are widely used in real-world applications but
remain vulnerable to distribution shifts, especially due to weather and
lighting changes. Collecting diverse real-world data for testing the robustness
of DL models is resource-intensive, making synthetic corruptions an attractive
alternative for robustness testing. However, are synthetic corruptions a
reliable proxy for real-world corruptions? To answer this, we conduct the
largest benchmarking study on semantic segmentation models, comparing
performance on real-world corruptions and synthetic corruptions datasets. Our
results reveal a strong correlation in mean performance, supporting the use of
synthetic corruptions for robustness evaluation. We further analyze
corruption-specific correlations, providing key insights to understand when
synthetic corruptions succeed in representing real-world corruptions.

Motivation: 传统方法需要复杂的元模型训练，而ORXE旨在简化开发过程，同时保持高效性和灵活性。

Method: 利用预训练的专家模型和基于置信度的门控机制，动态分配计算资源。

Result: 在图像分类任务中，ORXE表现优于单个专家模型和其他动态模型。

Conclusion: ORXE可扩展至其他应用，为多样化部署提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents ORXE, a modular and adaptable framework for achieving
real-time configurable efficiency in AI models. By leveraging a collection of
pre-trained experts with diverse computational costs and performance levels,
ORXE dynamically adjusts inference pathways based on the complexity of input
samples. Unlike conventional approaches that require complex metamodel
training, ORXE achieves high efficiency and flexibility without complicating
the development process. The proposed system utilizes a confidence-based gating
mechanism to allocate appropriate computational resources for each input. ORXE
also supports adjustments to the preference between inference cost and
prediction performance across a wide range during runtime. We implemented a
training-free ORXE system for image classification tasks, evaluating its
efficiency and accuracy across various devices. The results demonstrate that
ORXE achieves superior performance compared to individual experts and other
dynamic models in most cases. This approach can be extended to other
applications, providing a scalable solution for diverse real-world deployment
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: Mix-QSAM是一种混合精度的后训练量化框架，用于优化Segment Anything Model (SAM)的计算效率，通过层间协同和重要性评分实现更优的精度与效率平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM的高计算和内存需求限制了其在资源受限设备上的部署，现有固定位宽量化方法在精度和效率上表现不佳。

Method: 提出层间重要性评分（基于KL散度）和跨层协同度量（基于因果互信息），并通过整数二次规划（IQP）分配最优位宽。

Result: 在6位和4位混合精度设置下，Mix-QSAM在实例分割和目标检测任务中比现有方法平均精度提升20%。

Conclusion: Mix-QSAM通过动态位宽分配显著提升了量化模型的性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a popular vision foundation model;
however, its high computational and memory demands make deployment on
resource-constrained devices challenging. While Post-Training Quantization
(PTQ) is a practical approach for reducing computational overhead, existing PTQ
methods rely on fixed bit-width quantization, leading to suboptimal accuracy
and efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose Mix-QSAM, a
mixed-precision PTQ framework for SAM. First, we introduce a layer-wise
importance score, derived using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, to quantify
each layer's contribution to the model's output. Second, we introduce
cross-layer synergy, a novel metric based on causal mutual information, to
capture dependencies between adjacent layers. This ensures that highly
interdependent layers maintain similar bit-widths, preventing abrupt precision
mismatches that degrade feature propagation and numerical stability. Using
these metrics, we formulate an Integer Quadratic Programming (IQP) problem to
determine optimal bit-width allocation under model size and bit-operation
constraints, assigning higher precision to critical layers while minimizing
bit-width in less influential layers. Experimental results demonstrate that
Mix-QSAM consistently outperforms existing PTQ methods on instance segmentation
and object detection tasks, achieving up to 20% higher average precision under
6-bit and 4-bit mixed-precision settings, while maintaining computational
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像对齐方法在特征稀疏区域、极端尺度和视野差异以及大变形情况下表现不佳，导致对齐精度不足。

Method: ART方法通过自回归框架迭代估计从粗到细的变换，利用多尺度特征和随机采样点，结合交叉注意力层指导，专注于关键区域。

Result: 实验表明，ART在多种数据集上显著优于现有方法，适用于复杂条件下的精确图像对齐。

Conclusion: ART是一种强大的新方法，具有广泛适用性，能够有效解决图像对齐中的挑战性问题。

Abstract: Existing methods for image alignment struggle in cases involving
feature-sparse regions, extreme scale and field-of-view differences, and large
deformations, often resulting in suboptimal accuracy. Robustness to these
challenges improves through iterative refinement of the transformation field
while focusing on critical regions in multi-scale image representations. We
thus propose Auto-Regressive Transformation (ART), a novel method that
iteratively estimates the coarse-to-fine transformations within an
auto-regressive framework. Leveraging hierarchical multi-scale features, our
network refines the transformations using randomly sampled points at each
scale. By incorporating guidance from the cross-attention layer, the model
focuses on critical regions, ensuring accurate alignment even in challenging,
feature-limited conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
demonstrate that ART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
establishing it as a powerful new method for precise image alignment with broad
applicability.

<details>

Motivation: 现有MPQ方法需要在大规模数据集上进行昂贵的搜索，计算成本高。

Method: 在小数据集上搜索量化策略并推广至大数据集，结合锐度感知最小化、隐式梯度方向对齐和自适应扰动半径。

Result: 在CIFAR10上搜索策略后，在ImageNet上达到相同精度，计算效率提升150%。

Conclusion: 新方法简化了MPQ过程，显著降低了计算成本并保持了精度。

Abstract: Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) has become an essential technique for
optimizing neural network by determining the optimal bitwidth per layer.
Existing MPQ methods, however, face a major hurdle: they require a
computationally expensive search for quantization policies on large-scale
datasets. To resolve this issue, we introduce a novel approach that first
searches for quantization policies on small datasets and then generalizes them
to large-scale datasets. This approach simplifies the process, eliminating the
need for large-scale quantization fine-tuning and only necessitating model
weight adjustment. Our method is characterized by three key techniques:
sharpness-aware minimization for enhanced quantization generalization, implicit
gradient direction alignment to handle gradient conflicts among different
optimization objectives, and an adaptive perturbation radius to accelerate
optimization. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate our
approach. Using the CIFAR10 dataset (just 0.5\% the size of ImageNet training
data) for MPQ policy search, we achieved equivalent accuracy on ImageNet with a
significantly lower computational cost, while improving efficiency by up to
150% over the baselines.

Method: 提出了一种基于特征正交性解耦的策略，整合多特征向量，避免特征空间复杂化，同时确保特征区分度和减少冗余。

Result: 在FaceForensics++、Celeb-DF和DFDC数据集上的实验表明，该方法在跨数据集评估中优于现有最佳方法（Celeb-DF提升5%，DFDC提升7%）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过特征解耦和多信息整合，显著提升了深度伪造检测的泛化能力和性能，为应对新型伪造技术提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Remarkable advancements in generative AI technology have given rise to a
spectrum of novel deepfake categories with unprecedented leaps in their
realism, and deepfakes are increasingly becoming a nuisance to law enforcement
authorities and the general public. In particular, we observe alarming levels
of confusion, deception, and loss of faith regarding multimedia content within
society caused by face deepfakes, and existing deepfake detectors are
struggling to keep up with the pace of improvements in deepfake generation.
This is primarily due to their reliance on specific forgery artifacts, which
limits their ability to generalise and detect novel deepfake types. To combat
the spread of malicious face deepfakes, this paper proposes a new strategy that
leverages coarse-to-fine spatial information, semantic information, and their
interactions while ensuring feature distinctiveness and reducing the redundancy
of the modelled features. A novel feature orthogonality-based disentanglement
strategy is introduced to ensure branch-level and cross-branch feature
disentanglement, which allows us to integrate multiple feature vectors without
adding complexity to the feature space or compromising generalisation.
Comprehensive experiments on three public benchmarks: FaceForensics++,
Celeb-DF, and the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) show that these design
choices enable the proposed approach to outperform current state-of-the-art
methods by 5% on the Celeb-DF dataset and 7% on the DFDC dataset in a
cross-dataset evaluation setting.

Motivation: 传统表示学习方法依赖整体、黑盒嵌入，导致语义组件纠缠，限制了可解释性和泛化性，尤其在医学影像中问题突出。

Method: OWT框架将图像显式解耦为独立的标记组，每组对应特定器官或语义实体，并通过TGR训练范式提升可解释性和泛化性。

Result: 在CT和MRI数据集上的实验表明，OWT不仅实现了强图像重建和分割性能，还支持语义级生成和检索等新应用。

Conclusion: OWT作为一种语义解耦表示学习的基础框架，具有广泛的可扩展性和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning often rely on holistic, black-box
embeddings that entangle multiple semantic components, limiting
interpretability and generalization. These issues are especially critical in
medical imaging. To address these limitations, we propose an Organ-Wise
Tokenization (OWT) framework with a Token Group-based Reconstruction (TGR)
training paradigm. Unlike conventional approaches that produce holistic
features, OWT explicitly disentangles an image into separable token groups,
each corresponding to a distinct organ or semantic entity. Our design ensures
each token group encapsulates organ-specific information, boosting
interpretability, generalization, and efficiency while allowing fine-grained
control in downstream tasks. Experiments on CT and MRI datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of OWT in not only achieving strong image reconstruction and
segmentation performance, but also enabling novel semantic-level generation and
retrieval applications that are out of reach for standard holistic embedding
methods. These findings underscore the potential of OWT as a foundational
framework for semantically disentangled representation learning, offering broad
scalability and applicability to real-world medical imaging scenarios and
beyond.

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种名为Pro2SAM的新方法，通过结合Segment Anything Model (SAM)和创新的掩码提示技术，解决了弱监督目标定位（WSOL）中像素级细粒度信息不足的问题，并在CUB-200-2011和ILSVRC数据集上取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前WSOL方法（如CAM和自注意力图）无法学习像素级细粒度信息，限制了性能提升。论文旨在利用SAM的零样本泛化和细粒度分割能力，提升目标区域的激活效果。

Method: 1. 提出Pro2SAM网络，结合全局令牌变换器（GTFormer）生成粗粒度前景图作为掩码提示；2. 使用网格点作为密集提示输入SAM；3. 提出像素级相似性度量匹配掩码。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011和ILSVRC数据集上分别达到84.03%和66.85%的Top-1定位准确率，性能最优。

Conclusion: Pro2SAM通过结合SAM和创新的提示技术，显著提升了WSOL任务的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL), which aims to localize objects
by only using image-level labels, has attracted much attention because of its
low annotation cost in real applications. Current studies focus on the Class
Activation Map (CAM) of CNN and the self-attention map of transformer to
identify the region of objects. However, both CAM and self-attention maps can
not learn pixel-level fine-grained information on the foreground objects, which
hinders the further advance of WSOL. To address this problem, we initiatively
leverage the capability of zero-shot generalization and fine-grained
segmentation in Segment Anything Model (SAM) to boost the activation of
integral object regions. Further, to alleviate the semantic ambiguity issue
accrued in single point prompt-based SAM, we propose an innovative mask prompt
to SAM (Pro2SAM) network with grid points for WSOL task. First, we devise a
Global Token Transformer (GTFormer) to generate a coarse-grained foreground map
as a flexible mask prompt, where the GTFormer jointly embeds patch tokens and
novel global tokens to learn foreground semantics. Secondly, we deliver grid
points as dense prompts into SAM to maximize the probability of foreground
mask, which avoids the lack of objects caused by a single point/box prompt.
Finally, we propose a pixel-level similarity metric to come true the mask
matching from mask prompt to SAM, where the mask with the highest score is
viewed as the final localization map. Experiments show that the proposed
Pro2SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC,
with 84.03\% and 66.85\% Top-1 Loc, respectively.

Conclusion: SpatialPrompting提供了一种更简单、可扩展的3D空间推理替代方案。

Abstract: This study introduces SpatialPrompting, a novel framework that harnesses the
emergent reasoning capabilities of off-the-shelf multimodal large language
models to achieve zero-shot spatial reasoning in three-dimensional (3D)
environments. Unlike existing methods that rely on expensive 3D-specific
fine-tuning with specialized 3D inputs such as point clouds or voxel-based
features, SpatialPrompting employs a keyframe-driven prompt generation
strategy. This framework uses metrics such as vision-language similarity,
Mahalanobis distance, field of view, and image sharpness to select a diverse
and informative set of keyframes from image sequences and then integrates them
with corresponding camera pose data to effectively abstract spatial
relationships and infer complex 3D structures. The proposed framework not only
establishes a new paradigm for flexible spatial reasoning that utilizes
intuitive visual and positional cues but also achieves state-of-the-art
zero-shot performance on benchmark datasets, such as ScanQA and SQA3D, across
several metrics. The proposed method effectively eliminates the need for
specialized 3D inputs and fine-tuning, offering a simpler and more scalable
alternative to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: GlyphMastero通过精细的字形建模和多尺度特征融合，显著提升了场景文本编辑的性能。

Abstract: Scene text editing, a subfield of image editing, requires modifying texts in
images while preserving style consistency and visual coherence with the
surrounding environment. While diffusion-based methods have shown promise in
text generation, they still struggle to produce high-quality results. These
methods often generate distorted or unrecognizable characters, particularly
when dealing with complex characters like Chinese. In such systems, characters
are composed of intricate stroke patterns and spatial relationships that must
be precisely maintained. We present GlyphMastero, a specialized glyph encoder
designed to guide the latent diffusion model for generating texts with
stroke-level precision. Our key insight is that existing methods, despite using
pretrained OCR models for feature extraction, fail to capture the hierarchical
nature of text structures - from individual strokes to stroke-level
interactions to overall character-level structure. To address this, our glyph
encoder explicitly models and captures the cross-level interactions between
local-level individual characters and global-level text lines through our novel
glyph attention module. Meanwhile, our model implements a feature pyramid
network to fuse the multi-scale OCR backbone features at the global-level.
Through these cross-level and multi-scale fusions, we obtain more detailed
glyph-aware guidance, enabling precise control over the scene text generation
process. Our method achieves an 18.02\% improvement in sentence accuracy over
the state-of-the-art multi-lingual scene text editing baseline, while
simultaneously reducing the text-region Fr\'echet inception distance by
53.28\%.

Abstract: Infrared object tracking plays a crucial role in Anti-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(Anti-UAV) applications. Existing trackers often depend on cropped template
regions and have limited motion modeling capabilities, which pose challenges
when dealing with tiny targets. To address this, we propose a simple yet
effective infrared tiny-object tracker that enhances tracking performance by
integrating global detection and motion-aware learning with temporal priors.
Our method is based on object detection and achieves significant improvements
through two key innovations. First, we introduce frame dynamics, leveraging
frame difference and optical flow to encode both prior target features and
motion characteristics at the input level, enabling the model to better
distinguish the target from background clutter. Second, we propose a trajectory
constraint filtering strategy in the post-processing stage, utilizing
spatio-temporal priors to suppress false positives and enhance tracking
robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms
existing approaches across multiple metrics in challenging infrared UAV
tracking scenarios. Notably, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in the 4th
Anti-UAV Challenge, securing 1st place in Track 1 and 2nd place in Track 2.

Abstract: Reasoning lies at the heart of intelligence, shaping the ability to make
decisions, draw conclusions, and generalize across domains. In artificial
intelligence, as systems increasingly operate in open, uncertain, and
multimodal environments, reasoning becomes essential for enabling robust and
adaptive behavior. Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a
promising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and
video to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve
comprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning. As
research advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular,
perception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer
more coherent cross-modal understanding. While instruction tuning and
reinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges
remain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior. To
address these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of
multimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental
roadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging
capabilities. First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules,
where reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation,
alignment, and fusion. Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning
into multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)
and multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured
reasoning chains. Finally, drawing on empirical insights from challenging
benchmarks and experimental cases of OpenAI O3 and O4-mini, we discuss the
conceptual direction of native large multimodal reasoning models (N-LMRMs),
which aim to support scalable, agentic, and adaptive reasoning and planning in
complex, real-world environments.

accuracy is the scarcity of palmprint data. Recently, a popular line of
research revolves around the synthesis of virtual palmprints for large-scale
pre-training purposes. In this paper, we propose a novel synthesis method named
Canny2Palm that extracts palm textures with Canny edge detector and uses them
to condition a Pix2Pix network for realistic palmprint generation. By
re-assembling palmprint textures from different identities, we are able to
create new identities by seeding the generator with new assemblies. Canny2Palm
not only synthesizes realistic data following the distribution of real
palmprints but also enables controllable diversity to generate large-scale new
identities. On open-set palmprint recognition benchmarks, models pre-trained
with Canny2Palm synthetic data outperform the state-of-the-art with up to 7.2%
higher identification accuracy. Moreover, the performance of models pre-trained
with Canny2Palm continues to improve given 10,000 synthetic IDs while those
with existing methods already saturate, demonstrating the potential of our
method for large-scale pre-training.

Result: 在LPBA和OASIS数据集上实验表明，FF-PNet在Dice相似系数等指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FF-PNet无需注意力机制或多层感知机，仅通过传统卷积神经网络即实现了显著的配准精度提升，证明了RFFM和RDFFM的优越性。

Abstract: In recent years, deformable medical image registration techniques have made
significant progress. However, existing models still lack efficiency in
parallel extraction of coarse and fine-grained features. To address this, we
construct a new pyramid registration network based on feature and deformation
field (FF-PNet). For coarse-grained feature extraction, we design a Residual
Feature Fusion Module (RFFM), for fine-grained image deformation, we propose a
Residual Deformation Field Fusion Module (RDFFM). Through the parallel
operation of these two modules, the model can effectively handle complex image
deformations. It is worth emphasizing that the encoding stage of FF-PNet only
employs traditional convolutional neural networks without any attention
mechanisms or multilayer perceptrons, yet it still achieves remarkable
improvements in registration accuracy, fully demonstrating the superior feature
decoding capabilities of RFFM and RDFFM. We conducted extensive experiments on
the LPBA and OASIS datasets. The results show our network consistently
outperforms popular methods in metrics like the Dice Similarity Coefficient.

Abstract: Accurate building damage assessment using bi-temporal multi-modal remote
sensing images is essential for effective disaster response and recovery
planning. This study proposes a novel Building-Guided Pseudo-Label Learning
Framework to address the challenges of mapping building damage from
pre-disaster optical and post-disaster SAR images. First, we train a series of
building extraction models using pre-disaster optical images and building
labels. To enhance building segmentation, we employ multi-model fusion and
test-time augmentation strategies to generate pseudo-probabilities, followed by
a low-uncertainty pseudo-label training method for further refinement. Next, a
change detection model is trained on bi-temporal cross-modal images and damaged
building labels. To improve damage classification accuracy, we introduce a
building-guided low-uncertainty pseudo-label refinement strategy, which
leverages building priors from the previous step to guide pseudo-label
generation for damaged buildings, reducing uncertainty and enhancing
reliability. Experimental results on the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieved the
highest mIoU score (54.28%) and secured first place in the competition.

Abstract: Thanks to recent advancements in scalable deep architectures and large-scale

in producing high-fidelity, instruction-following content across a wide range
of styles, enabling applications in advertising, entertainment, and education.
However, these models' ability to render precise on-screen text, such as

Abstract: The proposed system outlined in this paper is a solution to a use case that
requires the autonomous picking of cuboidal objects from an organized or
unorganized pile with high precision. This paper presents an efficient method
for precise pose estimation of cuboid-shaped objects, which aims to reduce
errors in target pose in a time-efficient manner. Typical pose estimation
methods like global point cloud registrations are prone to minor pose errors
for which local registration algorithms are generally used to improve pose
accuracy. However, due to the execution time overhead and uncertainty in the
error of the final achieved pose, an alternate, linear time approach is
proposed for pose error estimation and correction. This paper presents an
overview of the solution followed by a detailed description of individual
modules of the proposed algorithm.

Motivation: 医学图像合成面临标注数据有限、模态差异和复杂病理表示的挑战，现有方法难以同时保持解剖学保真度和病理特征准确性。

Method: ViCTr采用两阶段框架：预训练阶段使用EWC保留关键解剖结构，微调阶段使用LoRA模块精确控制病理严重程度，并通过Tweedie公式实现一步采样。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，MFID为17.01（优于现有方法28%），数据增强提升nnUNet分割性能3.8% mDSC，生成图像临床不可区分于真实扫描。

Conclusion: ViCTr首次实现细粒度、病理感知的MRI合成，填补了AI医学影像研究的关键空白。

Abstract: Synthesizing medical images remains challenging due to limited annotated
pathological data, modality domain gaps, and the complexity of representing
diffuse pathologies such as liver cirrhosis. Existing methods often struggle to
maintain anatomical fidelity while accurately modeling pathological features,
frequently relying on priors derived from natural images or inefficient
multi-step sampling. In this work, we introduce ViCTr (Vital Consistency
Transfer), a novel two-stage framework that combines a rectified flow
trajectory with a Tweedie-corrected diffusion process to achieve high-fidelity,
pathology-aware image synthesis. First, we pretrain ViCTr on the ATLAS-8k
dataset using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to preserve critical
anatomical structures. We then fine-tune the model adversarially with Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) modules for precise control over pathology severity. By
reformulating Tweedie's formula within a linear trajectory framework, ViCTr
supports one-step sampling, reducing inference from 50 steps to just 4, without
sacrificing anatomical realism. We evaluate ViCTr on BTCV (CT), AMOS (MRI), and
CirrMRI600+ (cirrhosis) datasets. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, achieving a Medical Frechet Inception Distance (MFID) of 17.01 for
cirrhosis synthesis 28% lower than existing approaches and improving nnUNet
segmentation by +3.8% mDSC when used for data augmentation. Radiologist reviews
indicate that ViCTr-generated liver cirrhosis MRIs are clinically
indistinguishable from real scans. To our knowledge, ViCTr is the first method
to provide fine-grained, pathology-aware MRI synthesis with graded severity
control, closing a critical gap in AI-driven medical imaging research.

Conclusion: 研究表明，经过微调的VLM能有效辅助心脏病专家生成CAG图像的临床报告和治疗建议。

Abstract: Coronary angiography (CAG) is the gold-standard imaging modality for
evaluating coronary artery disease, but its interpretation and subsequent
treatment planning rely heavily on expert cardiologists. To enable AI-based
decision support, we introduce a two-stage, physician-curated pipeline and a
bilingual (Japanese/English) CAG image-report dataset. First, we sample 14,686
frames from 539 exams and annotate them for key-frame detection and left/right
laterality; a ConvNeXt-Base CNN trained on this data achieves 0.96 F1 on
laterality classification, even on low-contrast frames. Second, we apply the
CNN to 243 independent exams, extract 1,114 key frames, and pair each with its
pre-procedure report and expert-validated diagnostic and treatment summary,
yielding a parallel corpus. We then fine-tune three open-source VLMs
(PaliGemma2, Gemma3, and ConceptCLIP-enhanced Gemma3) via LoRA and evaluate
them using VLScore and cardiologist review. Although PaliGemma2 w/LoRA attains
the highest VLScore, Gemma3 w/LoRA achieves the top clinician rating (mean
7.20/10); we designate this best-performing model as CAG-VLM. These results
demonstrate that specialized, fine-tuned VLMs can effectively assist
cardiologists in generating clinical reports and treatment recommendations from
CAG images.

Conclusion: DenseGrounding方法有效解决了3D视觉定位的挑战，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Enabling intelligent agents to comprehend and interact with 3D environments
through natural language is crucial for advancing robotics and human-computer
interaction. A fundamental task in this field is ego-centric 3D visual
grounding, where agents locate target objects in real-world 3D spaces based on
verbal descriptions. However, this task faces two significant challenges: (1)
loss of fine-grained visual semantics due to sparse fusion of point clouds with
ego-centric multi-view images, (2) limited textual semantic context due to
arbitrary language descriptions. We propose DenseGrounding, a novel approach
designed to address these issues by enhancing both visual and textual
semantics. For visual features, we introduce the Hierarchical Scene Semantic
Enhancer, which retains dense semantics by capturing fine-grained global scene
features and facilitating cross-modal alignment. For text descriptions, we
propose a Language Semantic Enhancer that leverages large language models to
provide rich context and diverse language descriptions with additional context
during model training. Extensive experiments show that DenseGrounding
significantly outperforms existing methods in overall accuracy, with
improvements of 5.81% and 7.56% when trained on the comprehensive full dataset
and smaller mini subset, respectively, further advancing the SOTA in egocentric
3D visual grounding. Our method also achieves 1st place and receives the
Innovation Award in the CVPR 2024 Autonomous Grand Challenge Multi-view 3D

Conclusion: BiHumanML3D和BiMD结合ReAlign方法有效解决了双语文本到动作生成的挑战。

Abstract: Bilingual text-to-motion generation, which synthesizes 3D human motions from
bilingual text inputs, holds immense potential for cross-linguistic
applications in gaming, film, and robotics. However, this task faces critical
challenges: the absence of bilingual motion-language datasets and the
misalignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion models, leading
to semantically inconsistent or low-quality motions. To address these
challenges, we propose BiHumanML3D, a novel bilingual human motion dataset,
which establishes a crucial benchmark for bilingual text-to-motion generation
models. Furthermore, we propose a Bilingual Motion Diffusion model (BiMD),
which leverages cross-lingual aligned representations to capture semantics,
thereby achieving a unified bilingual model. Building upon this, we propose
Reward-guided sampling Alignment (ReAlign) method, comprising a step-aware
reward model to assess alignment quality during sampling and a reward-guided
strategy that directs the diffusion process toward an optimally aligned
distribution. This reward model integrates step-aware tokens and combines a
text-aligned module for semantic consistency and a motion-aligned module for
realism, refining noisy motions at each timestep to balance probability density
and alignment. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves
text-motion alignment and motion quality compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods. Project page: https://wengwanjiang.github.io/ReAlign-page/.

Result: 在2个基准数据集上，FedDDL平均Top-1准确率比现有方法高4.5%。

Conclusion: FedDDL有效解决了联邦学习中的属性偏差问题，提升了模型对主对象的关注能力。

Abstract: Attribute bias in federated learning (FL) typically leads local models to
optimize inconsistently due to the learning of non-causal associations,
resulting degraded performance. Existing methods either use data augmentation
for increasing sample diversity or knowledge distillation for learning
invariant representations to address this problem. However, they lack a
comprehensive analysis of the inference paths, and the interference from
confounding factors limits their performance. To address these limitations, we
propose the \underline{Fed}erated \underline{D}econfounding and
\underline{D}ebiasing \underline{L}earning (FedDDL) method. It constructs a
structured causal graph to analyze the model inference process, and performs
backdoor adjustment to eliminate confounding paths. Specifically, we design an
intra-client deconfounding learning module for computer vision tasks to
decouple background and objects, generating counterfactual samples that
establish a connection between the background and any label, which stops the
model from using the background to infer the label. Moreover, we design an
inter-client debiasing learning module to construct causal prototypes to reduce
the proportion of the background in prototype components. Notably, it bridges
the gap between heterogeneous representations via causal prototypical
regularization. Extensive experiments on 2 benchmarking datasets demonstrate
that \methodname{} significantly enhances the model capability to focus on main
objects in unseen data, leading to 4.5\% higher Top-1 Accuracy on average over
9 state-of-the-art existing methods.

Motivation: 视频拼接中，即使输入视频稳定，拼接后仍会出现时间上的warping shake，影响视觉体验。

Method: 设计双向分解模块分离单应变换，结合空间和时间warp推导拼接轨迹，提出warp平滑模型优化对齐和稳定性。

Result: StabStitch++在拼接性能、鲁棒性和效率上超越现有方法，实现实时在线视频拼接。

Conclusion: StabStitch++无需牺牲对齐即可优化稳定性，为视频拼接领域提供了显著进步。

Abstract: We retarget video stitching to an emerging issue, named warping shake, which
unveils the temporal content shakes induced by sequentially unsmooth warps when
extending image stitching to video stitching. Even if the input videos are
stable, the stitched video can inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and
affect the visual experience. To address this issue, we propose StabStitch++, a
novel video stitching framework to realize spatial stitching and temporal
stabilization with unsupervised learning simultaneously. First, different from
existing learning-based image stitching solutions that typically warp one image
to align with another, we suppose a virtual midplane between original image
planes and project them onto it. Concretely, we design a differentiable
bidirectional decomposition module to disentangle the homography transformation
and incorporate it into our spatial warp, evenly spreading alignment burdens
and projective distortions across two views. Then, inspired by camera paths in
video stabilization, we derive the mathematical expression of stitching
trajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal
warps. Finally, a warp smoothing model is presented to produce stable stitched
videos with a hybrid loss to simultaneously encourage content alignment,
trajectory smoothness, and online collaboration. Compared with StabStitch that
sacrifices alignment for stabilization, StabStitch++ makes no compromise and
optimizes both of them simultaneously, especially in the online mode. To
establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a
video stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes.
Experiments exhibit that StabStitch++ surpasses current solutions in stitching
performance, robustness, and efficiency, offering compelling advancements in
this field by building a real-time online video stitching system.

Abstract: Thoracolumbar stump ribs are one of the essential indicators of thoracolumbar
transitional vertebrae or enumeration anomalies. While some studies manually
assess these anomalies and describe the ribs qualitatively, this study aims to
automate thoracolumbar stump rib detection and analyze their morphology
quantitatively. To this end, we train a high-resolution deep-learning model for
rib segmentation and show significant improvements compared to existing models
(Dice score 0.997 vs. 0.779, p-value < 0.01). In addition, we use an iterative
algorithm and piece-wise linear interpolation to assess the length of the ribs,
showing a success rate of 98.2%. When analyzing morphological features, we show
that stump ribs articulate more posteriorly at the vertebrae (-19.2 +- 3.8 vs
-13.8 +- 2.5, p-value < 0.01), are thinner (260.6 +- 103.4 vs. 563.6 +- 127.1,
p-value < 0.01), and are oriented more downwards and sideways within the first
centimeters in contrast to full-length ribs. We show that with partially
visible ribs, these features can achieve an F1-score of 0.84 in differentiating
stump ribs from regular ones. We publish the model weights and masks for public

Abstract: Accurate online map matching is fundamental to vehicle navigation and the
activation of intelligent driving functions. Current online map matching
methods are prone to errors in complex road networks, especially in multilevel
road area. To address this challenge, we propose an online Standard Definition
(SD) map matching method by constructing a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with
multiple probability factors. Our proposed method can achieve accurate map
matching even in complex road networks by carefully leveraging lane markings
and scenario recognition in the designing of the probability factors. First,
the lane markings are generated by a multi-lane tracking method and associated
with the SD map using HMM to build an enriched SD map. In areas covered by the
enriched SD map, the vehicle can re-localize itself by performing Iterative
Closest Point (ICP) registration for the lane markings. Then, the probability
factor accounting for the lane marking detection can be obtained using the
association probability between adjacent lanes and roads. Second, the driving
scenario recognition model is applied to generate the emission probability
factor of scenario recognition, which improves the performance of map matching
on elevated roads and ordinary urban roads underneath them. We validate our
method through extensive road tests in Europe and China, and the experimental
results show that our proposed method effectively improves the online map
matching accuracy as compared to other existing methods, especially in
multilevel road area. Specifically, the experiments show that our proposed
method achieves $F_1$ scores of 98.04% and 94.60% on the Zenseact Open Dataset
and test data of multilevel road areas in Shanghai respectively, significantly
outperforming benchmark methods. The implementation is available at

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉条件挑战下仍能稳定学习，适用于实际工业应用。

Abstract: In controlled blasting operations, accurately detecting densely distributed
tiny boreholes from far-view imagery is critical for operational safety and
efficiency. However, existing detection methods often struggle due to small
object scales, highly dense arrangements, and limited distinctive visual
features of boreholes. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive
detection approach that builds upon existing architectures (e.g., YOLO) by
explicitly leveraging consistent embedding representations derived through
exponential moving average (EMA)-based statistical updates.
  Our method introduces three synergistic components: (1) adaptive augmentation
utilizing dynamically updated image statistics to robustly handle illumination
and texture variations; (2) embedding stabilization to ensure consistent and
reliable feature extraction; and (3) contextual refinement leveraging spatial
context for improved detection accuracy. The pervasive use of EMA in our method
is particularly advantageous given the limited visual complexity and small
scale of boreholes, allowing stable and robust representation learning even
under challenging visual conditions. Experiments on a challenging proprietary
quarry-site dataset demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline
YOLO-based architectures, highlighting our method's effectiveness in realistic
and complex industrial scenarios.

Conclusion: SOAP框架在生成可动画化3D头像方面表现出色，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Creating animatable 3D avatars from a single image remains challenging due to
style limitations (realistic, cartoon, anime) and difficulties in handling
accessories or hairstyles. While 3D diffusion models advance single-view
reconstruction for general objects, outputs often lack animation controls or
suffer from artifacts because of the domain gap. We propose SOAP, a
style-omniscient framework to generate rigged, topology-consistent avatars from
any portrait. Our method leverages a multiview diffusion model trained on 24K
3D heads with multiple styles and an adaptive optimization pipeline to deform
the FLAME mesh while maintaining topology and rigging via differentiable
rendering. The resulting textured avatars support FACS-based animation,
integrate with eyeballs and teeth, and preserve details like braided hair or
accessories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method
over state-of-the-art techniques for both single-view head modeling and
diffusion-based generation of Image-to-3D. Our code and data are publicly
available for research purposes at https://github.com/TingtingLiao/soap.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出Split Matching（SM）策略，通过解耦匈牙利匹配为两部分，分别处理已见类和未见类，结合CLIP特征聚类和伪掩码生成，提升了零样本语义分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本语义分割（ZSS）中，现有方法因缺乏未见类的监督而过拟合已见类。匈牙利匹配需要全监督且易将未见类误分类为背景。

Method: 提出Split Matching（SM），将匈牙利匹配解耦为已见类和候选类两部分，分别优化。通过CLIP特征聚类生成伪掩码，并结合多尺度特征增强模块（MFE）提升空间细节捕捉能力。

Result: 在标准基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SM是首个在归纳ZSS设置下引入解耦匈牙利匹配的方法，有效解决了未见类误分类问题。

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment categories that are not
annotated during training. While fine-tuning vision-language models has
achieved promising results, these models often overfit to seen categories due
to the lack of supervision for unseen classes. As an alternative to fully
supervised approaches, query-based segmentation has shown great latent in ZSS,
as it enables object localization without relying on explicit labels. However,
conventional Hungarian matching, a core component in query-based frameworks,
needs full supervision and often misclassifies unseen categories as background
in the setting of ZSS. To address this issue, we propose Split Matching (SM), a
novel assignment strategy that decouples Hungarian matching into two
components: one for seen classes in annotated regions and another for latent
classes in unannotated regions (referred to as unseen candidates).
Specifically, we partition the queries into seen and candidate groups, enabling
each to be optimized independently according to its available supervision. To
discover unseen candidates, we cluster CLIP dense features to generate pseudo
masks and extract region-level embeddings using CLS tokens. Matching is then
conducted separately for the two groups based on both class-level similarity
and mask-level consistency. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Feature
Enhancement (MFE) module that refines decoder features through residual
multi-scale aggregation, improving the model's ability to capture spatial
details across resolutions. SM is the first to introduce decoupled Hungarian
matching under the inductive ZSS setting, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two standard benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然环境中面部表情行为分析的两大挑战：缺乏大规模标注数据集和高效特征提取的困难。

Method: xTrace利用大规模数据集（45万视频）和可解释的面部特征描述符，结合低计算复杂度实现高精度。

Result: 在5万视频的验证集上，xTrace达到0.86平均CCC和0.13平均绝对误差，表现优于现有工具。

Conclusion: xTrace在2D情感空间中表现优异，对非正面头部姿态具有鲁棒性，且不确定性估计与准确性高度相关。

Abstract: Recognising expressive behaviours in face videos is a long-standing challenge
in Affective Computing. Despite significant advancements in recent years, it
still remains a challenge to build a robust and reliable system for
naturalistic and in-the-wild facial expressive behaviour analysis in real time.
This paper addresses two key challenges in building such a system: (1). The
paucity of large-scale labelled facial affect video datasets with extensive
coverage of the 2D emotion space, and (2). The difficulty of extracting facial
video features that are discriminative, interpretable, robust, and
computationally efficient. Toward addressing these challenges, we introduce
xTrace, a robust tool for facial expressive behaviour analysis and predicting
continuous values of dimensional emotions, namely valence and arousal, from
in-the-wild face videos.
  To address challenge (1), our affect recognition model is trained on the
largest facial affect video data set, containing ~450k videos that cover most
emotion zones in the dimensional emotion space, making xTrace highly versatile
in analysing a wide spectrum of naturalistic expressive behaviours. To address
challenge (2), xTrace uses facial affect descriptors that are not only
explainable, but can also achieve a high degree of accuracy and robustness with
low computational complexity. The key components of xTrace are benchmarked
against three existing tools: MediaPipe, OpenFace, and Augsburg Affect Toolbox.
On an in-the-wild validation set composed of 50k videos, xTrace achieves 0.86
mean CCC and 0.13 mean absolute error values. We present a detailed error
analysis of affect predictions from xTrace, illustrating (a). its ability to
recognise emotions with high accuracy across most bins in the 2D emotion space,
(b). its robustness to non-frontal head pose angles, and (c). a strong
correlation between its uncertainty estimates and its accuracy.

Motivation: SAM模型在语义分割应用中表现出色，但其类别无关的特性使得传统不确定性量化方法难以适用。

Method: 通过贝叶斯熵公式联合建模偶然性、认知性和任务不确定性，训练出轻量级后处理方法USAM。

Conclusion: USAM提供了一种计算成本低、易用的不确定性量化替代方案，适用于用户提示、半监督流程以及平衡精度与成本效率。

Abstract: The introduction of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has paved the way for
numerous semantic segmentation applications. For several tasks, quantifying the
uncertainty of SAM is of particular interest. However, the ambiguous nature of
the class-agnostic foundation model SAM challenges current uncertainty
quantification (UQ) approaches. This paper presents a theoretically motivated
uncertainty quantification model based on a Bayesian entropy formulation
jointly respecting aleatoric, epistemic, and the newly introduced task
uncertainty. We use this formulation to train USAM, a lightweight post-hoc UQ
method. Our model traces the root of uncertainty back to under-parameterised
models, insufficient prompts or image ambiguities. Our proposed deterministic
USAM demonstrates superior predictive capabilities on the SA-V, MOSE, ADE20k,
DAVIS, and COCO datasets, offering a computationally cheap and easy-to-use UQ
alternative that can support user-prompting, enhance semi-supervised pipelines,
or balance the tradeoff between accuracy and cost efficiency.

Method: 采用三种策略（LP、LFT、FFT）分析模型表现，提出ULFine策略，结合自适应拟合和双logit融合。

Result: FFT性能下降，LP和LFT对尾部类别效果有限；ULFine显著降低训练成本并提升准确性。

Conclusion: ULFine策略有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为LTSSL提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Based on the success of large-scale visual foundation models like CLIP in
various downstream tasks, this paper initially attempts to explore their impact
on Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) by employing the foundation
model with three strategies: Linear Probing (LP), Lightweight Fine-Tuning
(LFT), and Full Fine-Tuning (FFT). Our analysis presents the following
insights: i) Compared to LTSSL algorithms trained from scratch, FFT results in
a decline in model performance, whereas LP and LFT, although boosting overall
model performance, exhibit negligible benefits to tail classes. ii) LP produces
numerous false pseudo-labels due to \textit{underlearned} training data, while
LFT can reduce the number of these false labels but becomes overconfident about
them owing to \textit{biased fitting} training data. This exacerbates the
pseudo-labeled and classifier biases inherent in LTSSL, limiting performance
improvement in the tail classes. With these insights, we propose a Unbiased
Lightweight Fine-tuning strategy, \textbf{ULFine}, which mitigates the
overconfidence via confidence-aware adaptive fitting of textual prototypes and
counteracts the pseudo-labeled and classifier biases via complementary fusion
of dual logits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULFine markedly
decreases training costs by over ten times and substantially increases
prediction accuracies compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in multimodal tasks
such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification but struggles with
fine-grained understanding due to its focus on coarse-grained short captions.
To address this, we propose Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), which enhances
fine-grained understanding through three key innovations. First, we leverage
large multimodal models to generate 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for
capturing global-level semantic details. Second, a high-quality dataset is
constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding
boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich
representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are
incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic
differences. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these
data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original
CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks,
including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection,
image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks. These results
highlight FG-CLIP's effectiveness in capturing fine-grained image details and
improving overall model performance. The related data, code, and models are

Abstract: Human-robot interaction for assistive technologies relies on the prediction
of affordances, which are the potential actions a robot can perform on objects.
Predicting object affordances from visual perception is formulated differently
for tasks such as grasping detection, affordance classification, affordance
segmentation, and hand-object interaction synthesis. In this work, we highlight
the reproducibility issue in these redefinitions, making comparative benchmarks
unfair and unreliable. To address this problem, we propose a unified
formulation for visual affordance prediction, provide a comprehensive and
systematic review of previous works highlighting strengths and limitations of
methods and datasets, and analyse what challenges reproducibility. To favour
transparency, we introduce the Affordance Sheet, a document to detail the
proposed solution, the datasets, and the validation. As the physical properties
of an object influence the interaction with the robot, we present a generic
framework that links visual affordance prediction to the physical world. Using
the weight of an object as an example for this framework, we discuss how
estimating object mass can affect the affordance prediction. Our approach
bridges the gap between affordance perception and robot actuation, and accounts
for the complete information about objects of interest and how the robot
interacts with them to accomplish its task.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation for personalized identities aims at incorporating
the specific identity into images using a text prompt and an identity image.
Based on the powerful generative capabilities of DDPMs, many previous works
adopt additional prompts, such as text embeddings and CLIP image embeddings, to
represent the identity information, while they fail to disentangle the identity
information and background information. As a result, the generated images not
only lose key identity characteristics but also suffer from significantly
reduced diversity. To address this issue, previous works have combined the W+
space from StyleGAN with diffusion models, leveraging this space to provide a
more accurate and comprehensive representation of identity features through
multi-level feature extraction. However, the entanglement of identity and
background information in in-the-wild images during training prevents accurate
identity localization, resulting in severe semantic interference between
identity and background. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning-based
diffusion model for personalized identities text-to-image generation, named
PIDiff, which leverages the W+ space and an identity-tailored fine-tuning
strategy to avoid semantic entanglement and achieves accurate feature
extraction and localization. Style editing can also be achieved by PIDiff
through preserving the characteristics of identity features in the W+ space,
which vary from coarse to fine. Through the combination of the proposed
cross-attention block and parameter optimization strategy, PIDiff preserves the
identity information and maintains the generation capability for in-the-wild
images of the pre-trained model during inference. Our experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in this task.

Conclusion: E-NMSTFlow通过利用时空信息和非线性运动，显著提升了事件光流估计的准确性。

Abstract: Event cameras have the potential to capture continuous motion information
over time and space, making them well-suited for optical flow estimation.
However, most existing learning-based methods for event-based optical flow
adopt frame-based techniques, ignoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of
events. Additionally, these methods assume linear motion between consecutive
events within the loss time window, which increases optical flow errors in
long-time sequences. In this work, we observe that rich spatio-temporal
information and accurate nonlinear motion between events are crucial for
event-based optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose E-NMSTFlow, a novel
unsupervised event-based optical flow network focusing on long-time sequences.
We propose a Spatio-Temporal Motion Feature Aware (STMFA) module and an
Adaptive Motion Feature Enhancement (AMFE) module, both of which utilize rich
spatio-temporal information to learn spatio-temporal data associations.
Meanwhile, we propose a nonlinear motion compensation loss that utilizes the
accurate nonlinear motion between events to improve the unsupervised learning
of our network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. Remarkably, our method ranks first among
unsupervised learning methods on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets. Our project

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has surpassed human performance on standard benchmarks,
driving its widespread adoption in computer vision tasks. One such task is
disparity estimation, estimating the disparity between matching pixels in
stereo image pairs, which is crucial for safety-critical applications like
medical surgeries and autonomous navigation. However, DL-based disparity
estimation methods are highly susceptible to distribution shifts and
adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their reliability and
generalization. Despite these concerns, a standardized benchmark for evaluating
the robustness of disparity estimation methods remains absent, hindering
progress in the field.
  To address this gap, we introduce DispBench, a comprehensive benchmarking
tool for systematically assessing the reliability of disparity estimation
methods. DispBench evaluates robustness against synthetic image corruptions
such as adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution shifts caused by 2D Common
Corruptions across multiple datasets and diverse corruption scenarios. We
conduct the most extensive performance and robustness analysis of disparity
estimation methods to date, uncovering key correlations between accuracy,
reliability, and generalization. Open-source code for DispBench:

Conclusion: MDE-Edit为复杂多对象图像编辑提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-object editing aims to modify multiple objects or regions in complex
scenes while preserving structural coherence. This task faces significant
challenges in scenarios involving overlapping or interacting objects: (1)
Inaccurate localization of target objects due to attention misalignment,
leading to incomplete or misplaced edits; (2) Attribute-object mismatch, where
color or texture changes fail to align with intended regions due to
cross-attention leakage, creating semantic conflicts (\textit{e.g.}, color
bleeding into non-target areas). Existing methods struggle with these
challenges: approaches relying on global cross-attention mechanisms suffer from
attention dilution and spatial interference between objects, while mask-based
methods fail to bind attributes to geometrically accurate regions due to
feature entanglement in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations,
we propose a training-free, inference-stage optimization approach that enables
precise localized image manipulation in complex multi-object scenes, named
MDE-Edit. MDE-Edit optimizes the noise latent feature in diffusion models via
two key losses: Object Alignment Loss (OAL) aligns multi-layer cross-attention
with segmentation masks for precise object positioning, and Color Consistency
Loss (CCL) amplifies target attribute attention within masks while suppressing
leakage to adjacent regions. This dual-loss design ensures localized and
coherent multi-object edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDE-Edit
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing accuracy and visual quality,
offering a robust solution for complex multi-object image manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 声门下狭窄的严重程度评估通常依赖主观的视觉检查或CT扫描，前者不准确，后者有辐射风险。目前缺乏公开的自动化方法和数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法可自动化、重复性高地评估声门下狭窄，减少诊断时间和辐射暴露，并首次公开了相关基准数据集。

Abstract: Purpose: Subglottic stenosis refers to the narrowing of the subglottis, the
airway between the vocal cords and the trachea. Its severity is typically
evaluated by estimating the percentage of obstructed airway. This estimation
can be obtained from CT data or through visual inspection by experts exploring
the region. However, visual inspections are inherently subjective, leading to
less consistent and robust diagnoses. No public methods or datasets are
currently available for automated evaluation of this condition from
bronchoscopy video.
  Methods: We propose a pipeline for automated subglottic stenosis severity
estimation during the bronchoscopy exploration, without requiring the physician
to traverse the stenosed region. Our approach exploits the physical effect of
illumination decline in endoscopy to segment and track the lumen and obtain a
3D model of the airway. This 3D model is obtained from a single frame and is
used to measure the airway narrowing.
  Results: Our pipeline is the first to enable automated and robust subglottic
stenosis severity measurement using bronchoscopy images. The results show
consistency with ground-truth estimations from CT scans and expert estimations,
and reliable repeatability across multiple estimations on the same patient. Our
evaluation is performed on our new Subglottic Stenosis Dataset of real
bronchoscopy procedures data.
  Conclusion: We demonstrate how to automate evaluation of subglottic stenosis
severity using only bronchoscopy. Our approach can assist with and shorten
diagnosis and monitoring procedures, with automated and repeatable estimations
and less exploration time, and save radiation exposure to patients as no CT is
required. Additionally, we release the first public benchmark for subglottic
stenosis severity assessment.

Conclusion: GroVE提供了一种高效的后处理方法，无需重新训练VLM即可生成不确定性感知嵌入，显著提升了多模态任务的表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn joint representations by mapping images
and text into a shared latent space. However, recent research highlights that
deterministic embeddings from standard VLMs often struggle to capture the
uncertainties arising from the ambiguities in visual and textual descriptions
and the multiple possible correspondences between images and texts. Existing
approaches tackle this by learning probabilistic embeddings during VLM
training, which demands large datasets and does not leverage the powerful
representations already learned by large-scale VLMs like CLIP. In this paper,
we propose GroVE, a post-hoc approach to obtaining probabilistic embeddings
from frozen VLMs. GroVE builds on Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model
(GPLVM) to learn a shared low-dimensional latent space where image and text
inputs are mapped to a unified representation, optimized through single-modal
embedding reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. Once trained,
the Gaussian Process model generates uncertainty-aware probabilistic
embeddings. Evaluation shows that GroVE achieves state-of-the-art uncertainty
calibration across multiple downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval,
visual question answering, and active learning.

Motivation: 自动驾驶汽车在紧急车辆灯光下检测性能下降，存在安全隐患，需研究解决方案。

Method: 评估多种ADAS和对象检测器，分析灯光影响，提出Caracetamol框架。

Result: Caracetamol显著提升检测置信度，降低波动范围，满足实时处理需求。

Conclusion: Caracetamol有效缓解紧急车辆灯光对检测性能的影响，提升自动驾驶安全性。

Abstract: The safety of autonomous cars has come under scrutiny in recent years,
especially after 16 documented incidents involving Teslas (with autopilot
engaged) crashing into parked emergency vehicles (police cars, ambulances, and
firetrucks). While previous studies have revealed that strong light sources
often introduce flare artifacts in the captured image, which degrade the image
quality, the impact of flare on object detection performance remains unclear.
In this research, we unveil PaniCar, a digital phenomenon that causes an object
detector's confidence score to fluctuate below detection thresholds when
exposed to activated emergency vehicle lighting. This vulnerability poses a
significant safety risk, and can cause autonomous vehicles to fail to detect
objects near emergency vehicles. In addition, this vulnerability could be
exploited by adversaries to compromise the security of advanced driving
assistance systems (ADASs). We assess seven commercial ADASs (Tesla Model 3,
"manufacturer C", HP, Pelsee, AZDOME, Imagebon, Rexing), four object detectors
(YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN), and 14 patterns of emergency vehicle
lighting to understand the influence of various technical and environmental
factors. We also evaluate four SOTA flare removal methods and show that their
performance and latency are insufficient for real-time driving constraints. To
mitigate this risk, we propose Caracetamol, a robust framework designed to
enhance the resilience of object detectors against the effects of activated

*Wei Peng,Kang Liu,Jianchen Hu,Meng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: Biomed-DPT是一种知识增强的双模态提示调优技术，通过结合文本和视觉提示，显著提升了生物医学图像分类任务在少样本场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法仅关注文本提示，忽略了生物医学图像中的特殊结构（如复杂解剖结构和细微病理特征），Biomed-DPT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: Biomed-DPT设计了双模态提示：文本提示包括模板驱动的临床提示和LLM驱动的领域适应提示，并通过知识蒸馏提取临床知识；视觉提示引入零向量作为软提示，利用注意力重加权避免关注非诊断区域和非关键病理特征。

Result: 在11个生物医学图像数据集上，Biomed-DPT平均分类准确率达66.14%，在基类和新增类中分别达到78.06%和75.97%，优于CoOp方法6.20%、3.78%和8.04%。

Conclusion: Biomed-DPT通过双模态提示和知识蒸馏显著提升了生物医学图像分类的性能，为少样本场景下的任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt learning is one of the most effective paradigms for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to the biomedical image
classification tasks in few shot scenarios. However, most of the current prompt
learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular
structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological
features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a
knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text
prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven
clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted
prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts
through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt,
Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention
re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of
non-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average
classification accuracy of 66.14\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering
9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\% in base classes
and 75.97\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method
by 6.20\%, 3.78\%, and 8.04\%, respectively. Our code are available at

Motivation: 利用预训练的T2I扩散模型指导盲超分辨率任务，但传统U-Net架构性能有限，DiT表现更优。

Method: 提出EAM方法，结合Ψ-DiT块（三流架构）和渐进式掩码图像建模策略，并采用主题感知提示生成策略。

Result: EAM在多个数据集上达到SOTA，定量指标和视觉质量均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EAM通过DiT和优化策略，显著提升了盲超分辨率任务的性能。

Abstract: Utilizing pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models to guide Blind
Super-Resolution (BSR) has become a predominant approach in the field. While
T2I models have traditionally relied on U-Net architectures, recent
advancements have demonstrated that Diffusion Transformers (DiT) achieve
significantly higher performance in this domain. In this work, we introduce
Enhancing Anything Model (EAM), a novel BSR method that leverages DiT and
outperforms previous U-Net-based approaches. We introduce a novel block,
$\Psi$-DiT, which effectively guides the DiT to enhance image restoration. This
block employs a low-resolution latent as a separable flow injection control,
forming a triple-flow architecture that effectively leverages the prior
knowledge embedded in the pre-trained DiT. To fully exploit the prior guidance
capabilities of T2I models and enhance their generalization in BSR, we
introduce a progressive Masked Image Modeling strategy, which also reduces
training costs. Additionally, we propose a subject-aware prompt generation
strategy that employs a robust multi-modal model in an in-context learning
framework. This strategy automatically identifies key image areas, provides
detailed descriptions, and optimizes the utilization of T2I diffusion priors.
Our experiments demonstrate that EAM achieves state-of-the-art results across
multiple datasets, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics
and visual quality.

Abstract: Efficient view planning is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and
robotic perception, critical for tasks ranging from search and rescue
operations to autonomous navigation. While classical approaches, including
sampling-based and deterministic methods, have shown promise in planning camera
viewpoints for scene exploration, they often struggle with computational
scalability and solution optimality in complex settings. This study introduces
HQC-NBV, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for view planning that leverages
quantum properties to efficiently explore the parameter space while maintaining
robustness and scalability. We propose a specific Hamiltonian formulation with
multi-component cost terms and a parameter-centric variational ansatz with
bidirectional alternating entanglement patterns that capture the hierarchical
dependencies between viewpoint parameters. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that quantum-specific components provide measurable performance
advantages. Compared to the classical methods, our approach achieves up to
49.2% higher exploration efficiency across diverse environments. Our analysis
of entanglement architecture and coherence-preserving terms provides insights
into the mechanisms of quantum advantage in robotic exploration tasks. This
work represents a significant advancement in integrating quantum computing into
robotic perception systems, offering a paradigm-shifting solution for various
robot vision tasks.

Conclusion: 强调了在创意领域应用多模态系统时，需提升其可解释性。

Abstract: CLIP has emerged as a powerful multimodal model capable of connecting images
and text through joint embeddings, but to what extent does it "see" the same
way humans do - especially when interpreting artworks? In this paper, we
investigate CLIP's ability to extract high-level semantic and stylistic
information from paintings, including both human-created and AI-generated
imagery. We evaluate its perception across multiple dimensions: content, scene
understanding, artistic style, historical period, and the presence of visual
deformations or artifacts. By designing targeted probing tasks and comparing
CLIP's responses to human annotations and expert benchmarks, we explore its
alignment with human perceptual and contextual understanding. Our findings
reveal both strengths and limitations in CLIP's visual representations,
particularly in relation to aesthetic cues and artistic intent. We further
discuss the implications of these insights for using CLIP as a guidance
mechanism during generative processes, such as style transfer or prompt-based
image synthesis. Our work highlights the need for deeper interpretability in
multimodal systems, especially when applied to creative domains where nuance
and subjectivity play a central role.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose PADriver, a novel closed-loop framework for
personalized autonomous driving (PAD). Built upon Multi-modal Large Language

closed-loop benchmark named PAD-Highway based on Highway-Env simulator to
comprehensively evaluate the decision performance under traffic rules. The
dataset contains 250 hours videos with high-quality annotation to facilitate
the development of PAD behavior analysis. Experimental results on the

Abstract: We introduce the novel task of Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D
Scenes. Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual
prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is
to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared
with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding,
this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple
valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and
free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation
protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as
well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that
this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of
benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.

Conclusion: PRE-Mamba在多种雨强、视角甚至雪天条件下均表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Event cameras excel in high temporal resolution and dynamic range but suffer
from dense noise in rainy conditions. Existing event deraining methods face
trade-offs between temporal precision, deraining effectiveness, and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose PRE-Mamba, a novel
point-based event camera deraining framework that fully exploits the
spatiotemporal characteristics of raw event and rain. Our framework introduces
a 4D event cloud representation that integrates dual temporal scales to
preserve high temporal precision, a Spatio-Temporal Decoupling and Fusion
module (STDF) that enhances deraining capability by enabling shallow decoupling
and interaction of temporal and spatial information, and a Multi-Scale State
Space Model (MS3M) that captures deeper rain dynamics across dual-temporal and
multi-spatial scales with linear computational complexity. Enhanced by
frequency-domain regularization, PRE-Mamba achieves superior performance (0.95
SR, 0.91 NR, and 0.4s/M events) with only 0.26M parameters on EventRain-27K, a
comprehensive dataset with labeled synthetic and real-world sequences.
Moreover, our method generalizes well across varying rain intensities,

Abstract: Accurate building segmentation from high-resolution RGB imagery remains
challenging due to spectral similarity with non-building features, shadows, and
irregular building geometries. In this study, we present a comprehensive deep
learning framework for multiscale building segmentation using RGB aerial and
satellite imagery with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.4m to 2.7m. We curate
a diverse, multi-sensor dataset and introduce feature-augmented inputs by
deriving secondary representations including Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), Visible Difference Vegetation Index (VDVI), Morphological Building Index
(MBI), and Sobel edge filters from RGB channels. These features guide a
Res-U-Net architecture in learning complex spatial patterns more effectively.
We also propose training policies incorporating layer freezing, cyclical
learning rates, and SuperConvergence to reduce training time and resource
usage. Evaluated on a held-out WorldView-3 image, our model achieves an overall
accuracy of 96.5%, an F1-score of 0.86, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of

Method: 创建MSC数据库，包含10,426张图像（美丽与丑陋平衡），每张由100名观察者评估；利用图像指标分析美丽与丑陋图像对美学关系的影响。

Conclusion: 美学研究需考虑更广泛的美学价值范围，以避免因数据偏差导致的结论失真。

Abstract: While it is easy for human observers to judge an image as beautiful or ugly,
aesthetic decisions result from a combination of entangled perceptual and
cognitive (semantic) factors, making the understanding of aesthetic judgements
particularly challenging from a scientific point of view. Furthermore, our
research shows a prevailing bias in current databases, which include mostly
beautiful images, further complicating the study and prediction of aesthetic
responses. We address these limitations by creating a database of images with
minimal semantic content and devising, and next exploiting, a method to
generate images on the ugly side of aesthetic valuations. The resulting Minimum
Semantic Content (MSC) database consists of a large and balanced collection of
10,426 images, each evaluated by 100 observers. We next use established image
metrics to demonstrate how augmenting an image set biased towards beautiful
images with ugly images can modify, or even invert, an observed relationship
between image features and aesthetics valuation. Taken together, our study
reveals that works in empirical aesthetics attempting to link image content and
aesthetic judgements may magnify, underestimate, or simply miss interesting
effects due to a limitation of the range of aesthetic values they consider.

Abstract: The motion capture system that supports full-body virtual representation is
of key significance for virtual reality. Compared to vision-based systems,
full-body pose estimation from sparse tracking signals is not limited by
environmental conditions or recording range. However, previous works either
face the challenge of wearing additional sensors on the pelvis and lower-body
or rely on external visual sensors to obtain global positions of key joints. To
improve the practicality of the technology for virtual reality applications, we
estimate full-body poses using only inertial data obtained from three Inertial
Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors worn on the head and wrists, thereby reducing
the complexity of the hardware system. In this work, we propose a method called
Progressive Inertial Poser (ProgIP) for human pose estimation, which combines
neural network estimation with a human dynamics model, considers the
hierarchical structure of the kinematic chain, and employs a multi-stage
progressive network estimation with increased depth to reconstruct full-body
motion in real time. The encoder combines Transformer Encoder and bidirectional
LSTM (TE-biLSTM) to flexibly capture the temporal dependencies of the inertial
sequence, while the decoder based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) transforms
high-dimensional features and accurately projects them onto Skinned
Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model parameters. Quantitative and qualitative
experimental results on multiple public datasets show that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods with the same inputs, and is comparable to
recent works using six IMU sensors.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models demonstrate strong multimodal alignment
and generalization across diverse tasks. Among them, CLIP stands out as one of
the most successful approaches. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP
to sound source localization, proposing a self-supervised method operates
without explicit text input. We introduce a framework that maps audios into
tokens compatible with CLIP's text encoder, producing audio-driven embeddings.
These embeddings are used to generate sounding region masks, from which visual
features are extracted and aligned with the audio embeddings through a
contrastive audio-visual correspondence objective. Our findings show that
alignment knowledge of pre-trained multimodal foundation model enables our
method to generate more complete and compact localization for sounding objects.
We further propose an LLM-guided extension that distills object-aware
audio-visual scene understanding into the model during training to enhance
alignment. Extensive experiments across five diverse tasks demonstrate that our
method, in all variants, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and achieves
strong generalization in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Pioneering token-based works such as Chameleon and Emu3 have established a
foundation for multimodal unification but face challenges of high training
computational overhead and limited comprehension performance due to a lack of
high-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer
that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and
incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal
autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level
discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level
continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize
high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension
and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers
without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results
demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual
tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level
generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in
both comprehension and generation tasks. The code and models are available at

Conclusion: JointSeg在复杂地形和城乡区域表现优异，能够捕捉城市化动态，适用于大范围ISA制图。

Abstract: We propose a novel joint framework by integrating super-resolution and
segmentation, called JointSeg, which enables the generation of 1-meter ISA maps
directly from freely available Sentinel-2 imagery. JointSeg was trained on
multimodal cross-resolution inputs, offering a scalable and affordable
alternative to traditional approaches. This synergistic design enables gradual
resolution enhancement from 10m to 1m while preserving fine-grained spatial
textures, and ensures high classification fidelity through effective
cross-scale feature fusion. This method has been successfully applied to the
Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), a region characterized by complex
urban-rural patterns and diverse topography. As a result, a comprehensive ISA
mapping product for 2021, referred to as ISA-1, was generated, covering an area
of over 2.2 million square kilometers. Quantitative comparisons against the 10m
ESA WorldCover and other benchmark products reveal that ISA-1 achieves an
F1-score of 85.71%, outperforming bilinear-interpolation-based segmentation by
9.5%, and surpassing other ISA datasets by 21.43%-61.07%. In densely urbanized
areas (e.g., Suzhou, Nanjing), ISA-1 reduces ISA overestimation through
improved discrimination of green spaces and water bodies. Conversely, in
mountainous regions (e.g., Ganzi, Zhaotong), it identifies significantly more
ISA due to its enhanced ability to detect fragmented anthropogenic features
such as rural roads and sparse settlements, demonstrating its robustness across
diverse landscapes. Moreover, we present biennial ISA maps from 2017 to 2023,
capturing spatiotemporal urbanization dynamics across representative cities.
The results highlight distinct regional growth patterns: rapid expansion in
upstream cities, moderate growth in midstream regions, and saturation in
downstream metropolitan areas.

Abstract: Visual Document Understanding has become essential with the increase of
text-rich visual content. This field poses significant challenges due to the
need for effective integration of visual perception and textual comprehension,
particularly across diverse document types with complex layouts. Moreover,
existing fine-tuning datasets for this domain often fall short in providing the
detailed contextual information for robust understanding, leading to
hallucinations and limited comprehension of spatial relationships among visual
elements. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative pipeline that
utilizes adaptive generation of markup languages, such as Markdown, JSON, HTML,
and TiKZ, to build highly structured document representations and deliver
contextually-grounded responses. We introduce two fine-grained structured
datasets: DocMark-Pile, comprising approximately 3.8M pretraining data pairs
for document parsing, and DocMark-Instruct, featuring 624k fine-tuning data
annotations for grounded instruction following. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-theart MLLMs across a range of visual document understanding
benchmarks, facilitating advanced reasoning and comprehension capabilities in
complex visual scenarios. Our code and models are released at https://github.

Result: 在基准数据集上验证了TM方法的有效性，提升了SNN对分布变化的鲁棒性，同时保持低计算成本。

Conclusion: TM方法为SNN的在线测试时间适应提供了实用解决方案，并为未来神经形态芯片设计提供了启发。

Abstract: Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips,
provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios.
However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has
become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a
promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data
distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples.
Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional
artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this
gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time
adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution
shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which
dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired
normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in
improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining
low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for
online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of
future neuromorphic chips. The demo code is available at
github.com/NneurotransmitterR/TM-OTTA-SNN.

Abstract: We present StreamBridge, a simple yet effective framework that seamlessly
transforms offline Video-LLMs into streaming-capable models. It addresses two
fundamental challenges in adapting existing models into online scenarios: (1)
limited capability for multi-turn real-time understanding, and (2) lack of
proactive response mechanisms. Specifically, StreamBridge incorporates (1) a
memory buffer combined with a round-decayed compression strategy, supporting
long-context multi-turn interactions, and (2) a decoupled, lightweight
activation model that can be effortlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs,
enabling continuous proactive responses. To further support StreamBridge, we
construct Stream-IT, a large-scale dataset tailored for streaming video
understanding, featuring interleaved video-text sequences and diverse
instruction formats. Extensive experiments show that StreamBridge significantly
improves the streaming understanding capabilities of offline Video-LLMs across
various tasks, outperforming even proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini
1.5 Pro. Simultaneously, it achieves competitive or superior performance on
standard video understanding benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头发丝重建是计算机视觉和图形学中的基础问题，但现有方法依赖RGB捕获，对环境敏感且难以提取复杂发型的方向。

Method: 利用扫描的锐利表面特征和神经2D线检测器估计头发方向，并结合扩散先验和合成数据集优化。

Result: 方法能够准确重建简单和复杂发型，无需依赖颜色信息，并发布了Strands400数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为头发丝重建提供了高效解决方案，并推动了相关研究。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that reconstructs hair strands directly from
colorless 3D scans by leveraging multi-modal hair orientation extraction. Hair
strand reconstruction is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics
that can be used for high-fidelity digital avatar synthesis, animation, and
AR/VR applications. However, accurately recovering hair strands from raw scan
data remains challenging due to human hair's complex and fine-grained
structure. Existing methods typically rely on RGB captures, which can be
sensitive to the environment and can be a challenging domain for extracting the
orientation of guiding strands, especially in the case of challenging
hairstyles. To reconstruct the hair purely from the observed geometry, our
method finds sharp surface features directly on the scan and estimates strand
orientation through a neural 2D line detector applied to the renderings of scan
shading. Additionally, we incorporate a diffusion prior trained on a diverse
set of synthetic hair scans, refined with an improved noise schedule, and
adapted to the reconstructed contents via a scan-specific text prompt. We
demonstrate that this combination of supervision signals enables accurate
reconstruction of both simple and intricate hairstyles without relying on color
information. To facilitate further research, we introduce Strands400, the
largest publicly available dataset of hair strands with detailed surface
geometry extracted from real-world data, which contains reconstructed hair
strands from the scans of 400 subjects.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于状态空间模型（SSMs）的新型事件去噪框架，解决了现有方法在计算复杂性和鲁棒性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机的高动态范围和低延迟特性使其适用于高速视觉，但输出噪声大，现有去噪方法难以兼顾高效与鲁棒性。

Method: 将事件表示为4D事件云，通过粗特征提取模块（CFE）从几何和极性感知子空间提取特征，结合空间Mamba（S-SSM）和时间Mamba（T-SSM）建模局部几何结构和全局时间动态。

Result: 模型参数88.89K，推理时间0.0685s/100K事件，准确率0.982，比Transformer方法准确率高2.08%，速度快36倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和效率上均达到最优，为事件相机去噪提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras excel in high-speed vision due to their high temporal
resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption. However, as dynamic
vision sensors, their output is inherently noisy, making efficient denoising
essential to preserve their ultra-low latency and real-time processing
capabilities. Existing event denoising methods struggle with a critical
dilemma: computationally intensive approaches compromise the sensor's
high-speed advantage, while lightweight methods often lack robustness across
varying noise levels. To address this, we propose a novel event denoising
framework based on State Space Models (SSMs). Our approach represents events as
4D event clouds and includes a Coarse Feature Extraction (CFE) module that
extracts embedding features from both geometric and polarity-aware subspaces.
The model is further composed of two essential components: A Spatial Mamba
(S-SSM) that models local geometric structures and a Temporal Mamba (T-SSM)
that captures global temporal dynamics, efficiently propagating spatiotemporal
features across events. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency, with 88.89K parameters, 0.0685s per
100K events inference time, and a 0.982 accuracy score, outperforming
Transformer-based methods by 2.08% in denoising accuracy and 36X faster.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路边点云的3D物体检测尚未被充分探索，而点云检测器的性能关键在于网络的感受野和场景上下文利用能力。Mamba（基于状态空间模型）因其高效的全局感受野成为新选择。

Method: 提出PillarMamba框架，结合CSG实现跨阶段特征融合，并通过HSB模块解决状态空间模型的局部连接和历史关系遗忘问题，增强局部-全局上下文。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X-I基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PillarMamba通过结合CSG和HSB，有效提升了路边点云检测的性能，为智能交通系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Serving the Intelligent Transport System (ITS) and Vehicle-to-Everything
(V2X) tasks, roadside perception has received increasing attention in recent
years, as it can extend the perception range of connected vehicles and improve
traffic safety. However, roadside point cloud oriented 3D object detection has
not been effectively explored. To some extent, the key to the performance of a
point cloud detector lies in the receptive field of the network and the ability
to effectively utilize the scene context. The recent emergence of Mamba, based
on State Space Model (SSM), has shaken up the traditional convolution and
transformers that have long been the foundational building blocks, due to its
efficient global receptive field. In this work, we introduce Mamba to
pillar-based roadside point cloud perception and propose a framework based on
Cross-stage State-space Group (CSG), called PillarMamba. It enhances the
expressiveness of the network and achieves efficient computation through
cross-stage feature fusion. However, due to the limitations of scan directions,
state space model faces local connection disrupted and historical relationship
forgotten. To address this, we propose the Hybrid State-space Block (HSB) to
obtain the local-global context of roadside point cloud. Specifically, it
enhances neighborhood connections through local convolution and preserves
historical memory through residual attention. The proposed method outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods on the popular large scale roadside benchmark:
DAIR-V2X-I. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: 空间智能（SI）是跨学科的重要认知能力，但目前缺乏标准化评估方法。SITE旨在填补这一空白，全面评估模型的SI能力。

Method: 通过结合对31个现有数据集的调查和认知科学中的分类系统，设计了两类新任务（视点选择和动态场景）。数据集涵盖多种视觉模态和SI因素。

Result: 实验显示，领先模型在空间定向等关键SI因素上表现不佳，且空间推理能力与具身AI任务表现呈正相关。

Conclusion: SITE为评估空间智能提供了标准化工具，揭示了当前模型的不足，并展示了空间推理能力与具身AI任务的相关性。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence (SI) represents a cognitive ability encompassing the
visualization, manipulation, and reasoning about spatial relationships,
underpinning disciplines from neuroscience to robotics. We introduce SITE, a
benchmark dataset towards SI Thorough Evaluation in a standardized format of
multi-choice visual question-answering, designed to assess large
vision-language models' spatial intelligence across diverse visual modalities
(single-image, multi-image, and video) and SI factors (figural to environmental
scales, spatial visualization and orientation, intrinsic and extrinsic, static
and dynamic). Our approach to curating the benchmark combines a bottom-up
survey about 31 existing datasets and a top-down strategy drawing upon three
classification systems in cognitive science, which prompt us to design two
novel types of tasks about view-taking and dynamic scenes. Extensive
experiments reveal that leading models fall behind human experts especially in
spatial orientation, a fundamental SI factor. Moreover, we demonstrate a
positive correlation between a model's spatial reasoning proficiency and its
performance on an embodied AI task.

Conclusion: LegoGPT为文本到LEGO设计提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce LegoGPT, the first approach for generating physically stable
LEGO brick models from text prompts. To achieve this, we construct a
large-scale, physically stable dataset of LEGO designs, along with their
associated captions, and train an autoregressive large language model to
predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction. To improve the
stability of the resulting designs, we employ an efficient validity check and
physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, which prunes infeasible
token predictions using physics laws and assembly constraints. Our experiments
show that LegoGPT produces stable, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing LEGO
designs that align closely with the input text prompts. We also develop a
text-based LEGO texturing method to generate colored and textured designs. We
show that our designs can be assembled manually by humans and automatically by
robotic arms. We also release our new dataset, StableText2Lego, containing over
47,000 LEGO structures of over 28,000 unique 3D objects accompanied by detailed

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流匹配模型缺乏有效的探索机制，Flow-GRPO旨在通过RL增强模型的探索能力，同时保持高效采样。

Method: 采用两种策略：1) ODE-to-SDE转换，实现统计采样；2) 降噪减少策略，提升训练效率。

Result: 在文本到图像任务中表现优异，GenEval准确率从63%提升至95%，文本渲染准确率从59%提升至92%，且未牺牲图像质量或多样性。

Conclusion: Flow-GRPO成功整合RL与流匹配模型，显著提升生成任务性能，同时保持稳定性和多样性。

Abstract: We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement
learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies:
(1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation
(SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps,
enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction
strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original
inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without
performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple
text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly
perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting
GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy
improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation.
Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment.
Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase
at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our
experiments.

Result: 在理解和生成任务中达到SOTA，支持高质量交错输出，具备零样本图像编辑和组合生成能力。

Conclusion: Mogao为实用全模态基础模型，推动统一多模态系统发展。

Abstract: Recent progress in unified models for image understanding and generation has
been impressive, yet most approaches remain limited to single-modal generation
conditioned on multiple modalities. In this paper, we present Mogao, a unified
framework that advances this paradigm by enabling interleaved multi-modal
generation through a causal approach. Mogao integrates a set of key technical
improvements in architecture design, including a deep-fusion design, dual
vision encoders, interleaved rotary position embeddings, and multi-modal
classifier-free guidance, which allow it to harness the strengths of both
autoregressive models for text generation and diffusion models for high-quality
image synthesis. These practical improvements also make Mogao particularly
effective to process interleaved sequences of text and images arbitrarily. To
further unlock the potential of unified models, we introduce an efficient
training strategy on a large-scale, in-house dataset specifically curated for
joint text and image generation. Extensive experiments show that Mogao not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal understanding and
text-to-image generation, but also excels in producing high-quality, coherent
interleaved outputs. Its emergent capabilities in zero-shot image editing and
compositional generation highlight Mogao as a practical omni-modal foundation
model, paving the way for future development and scaling the unified
multi-modal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SfM方法通常采用两阶段流程，结合学习或几何对推理与全局优化步骤。DiffusionSfM旨在直接通过多视图推理实现更高效的3D重建。

Method: DiffusionSfM将场景几何和相机姿态参数化为全局帧中的像素级射线起点和终点，并采用基于Transformer的去噪扩散模型进行预测。针对训练中的缺失数据和无限场景坐标问题，引入了专用机制。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，DiffusionSfM优于传统和学习方法，并能自然建模不确定性。

Conclusion: DiffusionSfM为3D重建提供了一种高效且鲁棒的数据驱动方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Current Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods typically follow a two-stage
pipeline, combining learned or geometric pairwise reasoning with a subsequent
global optimization step. In contrast, we propose a data-driven multi-view
reasoning approach that directly infers 3D scene geometry and camera poses from
multi-view images. Our framework, DiffusionSfM, parameterizes scene geometry
and cameras as pixel-wise ray origins and endpoints in a global frame and
employs a transformer-based denoising diffusion model to predict them from
multi-view inputs. To address practical challenges in training diffusion models
with missing data and unbounded scene coordinates, we introduce specialized
mechanisms that ensure robust learning. We empirically validate DiffusionSfM on
both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms classical
and learning-based approaches while naturally modeling uncertainty.

Abstract: 3D scene generation seeks to synthesize spatially structured, semantically
meaningful, and photorealistic environments for applications such as immersive
media, robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied AI. Early methods based on
procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in
deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations
(e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene
distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent
advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by
reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides
a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four
paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based
generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations,
trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets,
evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing
key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations,
and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity,
physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation
models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and
highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D

Motivation: 现有方法中，3D高斯泼溅需要多视角数据，而视频扩散模型在单图像动画生成中难以保持一致性。SVAD旨在结合两者优势，解决单图像3D化身生成的挑战。

Method: 通过视频扩散生成合成训练数据，结合身份保持和图像修复模块优化数据，并用于训练3D高斯泼溅化身。

Conclusion: SVAD通过融合扩散模型生成能力和3D高斯泼溅的高质量渲染，为单图像高保真化身生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: Creating high-quality animatable 3D human avatars from a single image remains
a significant challenge in computer vision due to the inherent difficulty of
reconstructing complete 3D information from a single viewpoint. Current
approaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
produce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences,
while video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but
struggle with consistency and identity preservation. We present SVAD, a novel
approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths
of existing techniques. Our method generates synthetic training data through
video diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration
modules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars. Comprehensive
evaluations demonstrate that SVAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
single-image methods in maintaining identity consistency and fine details
across novel poses and viewpoints, while enabling real-time rendering
capabilities. Through our data augmentation pipeline, we overcome the
dependency on dense monocular or multi-view training data typically required by
traditional 3DGS approaches. Extensive quantitative, qualitative comparisons
show our method achieves superior performance across multiple metrics against
baseline models. By effectively combining the generative power of diffusion
models with both the high-quality results and rendering efficiency of 3DGS, our
work establishes a new approach for high-fidelity avatar generation from a
single image input.

Abstract: The complexity and difficulties of Kurdish speaker detection among its

Sorani, and Hawrami offers special challenges for speaker recognition systems.
The main difficulties in building a strong speaker identification system
capable of precisely identifying speakers across several dialects are
investigated in this work. To raise the accuracy and dependability of these

approaches, data augmentation tactics, and the building of thorough
dialect-specific corpus. The results show that customized strategies for every

*Wenyang Liu,Jianjun Gao,Kim-Hui Yap*

Main category: cs.MM

TLDR: SSH-Net是一种自监督混合网络，用于去除图像中的可见水印和噪声，通过双网络设计和共享特征编码器实现高效处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖成对数据集，实际中难以获取，因此提出自监督方法解决水印去除问题。

Method: SSH-Net采用双网络设计，上层网络处理噪声，下层网络结合Transformer块处理水印和噪声，共享特征编码器提取共同特征。

Result: SSH-Net能够有效去除水印和噪声，无需依赖成对数据集。

Conclusion: SSH-Net为自监督水印去除提供了一种高效解决方案，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Visible watermark removal is challenging due to its inherent complexities and
the noise carried within images. Existing methods primarily rely on supervised
learning approaches that require paired datasets of watermarked and
watermark-free images, which are often impractical to obtain in real-world
scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose SSH-Net, a Self-Supervised and
Hybrid Network specifically designed for noisy image watermark removal. SSH-Net
synthesizes reference watermark-free images using the watermark distribution in
a self-supervised manner and adopts a dual-network design to address the task.
The upper network, focused on the simpler task of noise removal, employs a
lightweight CNN-based architecture, while the lower network, designed to handle
the more complex task of simultaneously removing watermarks and noise,
incorporates Transformer blocks to model long-range dependencies and capture
intricate image features. To enhance the model's effectiveness, a shared
CNN-based feature encoder is introduced before dual networks to extract common
features that both networks can leverage. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/wenyang001/SSH-Net.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has advanced significantly, offering benefits
such as system simplicity and stronger driving performance in both open-loop
and closed-loop settings than conventional pipelines. However, existing
frameworks still suffer from low success rates in closed-loop evaluations,
highlighting their limitations in real-world deployment. In this paper, we
introduce X-Driver, a unified multi-modal large language models(MLLMs)
framework designed for closed-loop autonomous driving, leveraging
Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and autoregressive modeling to enhance perception and
decision-making. We validate X-Driver across multiple autonomous driving tasks
using public benchmarks in CARLA simulation environment, including
Bench2Drive[6]. Our experimental results demonstrate superior closed-loop
performance, surpassing the current state-of-the-art(SOTA) while improving the
interpretability of driving decisions. These findings underscore the importance
of structured reasoning in end-to-end driving and establish X-Driver as a
strong baseline for future research in closed-loop autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双机械臂操作的高维性和协调需求使得数据收集成本高，需要可扩展的数据增强方法。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成视角一致的双臂图像和动作标签，并通过约束优化确保动作可行性。

Result: 在5个模拟和3个真实任务中，D-CODA表现优于基线方法，验证了其数据增强的有效性。

Conclusion: D-CODA为双机械臂模仿学习提供了一种可扩展的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: Learning bimanual manipulation is challenging due to its high dimensionality
and tight coordination required between two arms. Eye-in-hand imitation
learning, which uses wrist-mounted cameras, simplifies perception by focusing
on task-relevant views. However, collecting diverse demonstrations remains
costly, motivating the need for scalable data augmentation. While prior work
has explored visual augmentation in single-arm settings, extending these
approaches to bimanual manipulation requires generating viewpoint-consistent
observations across both arms and producing corresponding action labels that
are both valid and feasible. In this work, we propose Diffusion for COordinated
Dual-arm Data Augmentation (D-CODA), a method for offline data augmentation
tailored to eye-in-hand bimanual imitation learning that trains a diffusion
model to synthesize novel, viewpoint-consistent wrist-camera images for both
arms while simultaneously generating joint-space action labels. It employs
constrained optimization to ensure that augmented states involving
gripper-to-object contacts adhere to constraints suitable for bimanual
coordination. We evaluate D-CODA on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our
results across 2250 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate
that it outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable
data augmentation in eye-in-hand bimanual manipulation. Our project website is

Abstract: The miniaturisation of sensors and processors, the advancements in connected
edge intelligence, and the exponential interest in Artificial Intelligence are
boosting the affirmation of autonomous nano-size drones in the Internet of
Robotic Things ecosystem. However, achieving safe autonomous navigation and
high-level tasks such as exploration and surveillance with these tiny platforms
is extremely challenging due to their limited resources. This work focuses on
enabling the safe and autonomous flight of a pocket-size, 30-gram platform
called Crazyflie 2.1 in a partially known environment. We propose a novel
AI-aided, vision-based reactive planning method for obstacle avoidance under
the ambit of Integrated Sensing, Computing and Communication paradigm. We deal
with the constraints of the nano-drone by splitting the navigation task into
two parts: a deep learning-based object detector runs on the edge (external
hardware) while the planning algorithm is executed onboard. The results show
the ability to command the drone at $\sim8$ frames-per-second and a model
performance reaching a COCO mean-average-precision of $60.8$. Field experiments
demonstrate the feasibility of the solution with the drone flying at a top
speed of $1$ m/s while steering away from an obstacle placed in an unknown
position and reaching the target destination. The outcome highlights the
compatibility of the communication delay and the model performance with the
requirements of the real-time navigation task. We provide a feasible
alternative to a fully onboard implementation that can be extended to
autonomous exploration with nano-drones.

Motivation: 现有数据集未能充分反映户外环境的重大变化，尤其是建筑和拆除带来的结构变化，因此需要新的数据集和方法来支持长期地点识别的研究。

Method: 使用CARLA模拟器创建CNS数据集，捕捉多样化的建筑和拆除变化；提出TCR_sym度量标准，用于一致测量结构变化。

Result: CNS数据集比现有真实世界基准包含更广泛的变化；评估显示现有LiDAR-based PR方法在CNS上性能显著下降。

Conclusion: CNS数据集填补了现有数据集的不足，突显了开发能够处理重大环境变化的鲁棒算法的必要性。

Abstract: Large-scale construction and demolition significantly challenge long-term
place recognition (PR) by drastically reshaping urban and suburban
environments. Existing datasets predominantly reflect limited or indoor-focused
changes, failing to adequately represent extensive outdoor transformations. To
bridge this gap, we introduce the City that Never Settles (CNS) dataset, a
simulation-based dataset created using the CARLA simulator, capturing major
structural changes-such as building construction and demolition-across diverse
maps and sequences. Additionally, we propose TCR_sym, a symmetric version of
the original TCR metric, enabling consistent measurement of structural changes
irrespective of source-target ordering. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate
that CNS encompasses more extensive transformations than current real-world
benchmarks. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LiDAR-based PR methods on CNS
reveal substantial performance degradation, underscoring the need for robust
algorithms capable of handling significant environmental changes. Our dataset

TLDR: 提出了一种基于多目标强化学习（MORL）和偏好驱动优化的自动驾驶方法，能够动态适应用户驾驶风格偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端驾驶方法通常依赖预设风格或持续用户反馈，难以支持动态、上下文相关的偏好。

Method: 使用MORL和偏好驱动优化，将偏好编码为连续权重向量，调节可解释的驾驶风格目标（如效率、舒适性、速度和激进性）。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中验证，代理能根据偏好动态调整驾驶行为，同时保持避碰和路线完成性能。

Conclusion: 该方法无需策略重训练即可实现驾驶风格的动态适应，提升了用户信任和满意度。

Abstract: Human drivers exhibit individual preferences regarding driving style.
Adapting autonomous vehicles to these preferences is essential for user trust
and satisfaction. However, existing end-to-end driving approaches often rely on
predefined driving styles or require continuous user feedback for adaptation,
limiting their ability to support dynamic, context-dependent preferences. We
propose a novel approach using multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)
with preference-driven optimization for end-to-end autonomous driving that
enables runtime adaptation to driving style preferences. Preferences are
encoded as continuous weight vectors to modulate behavior along interpretable
style objectives$\unicode{x2013}$including efficiency, comfort, speed, and
aggressiveness$\unicode{x2013}$without requiring policy retraining. Our
single-policy agent integrates vision-based perception in complex mixed-traffic
scenarios and is evaluated in diverse urban environments using the CARLA
simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent dynamically adapts
its driving behavior according to changing preferences while maintaining
performance in terms of collision avoidance and route completion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CMI在图像重建和分类阶段的高计算需求问题，改进现有方法的性能。

Method: 在ClassiGAN中引入注意力门模块，动态聚焦重要特征，抑制无关信息。

Result: 相比传统CMI方法，重建时间显著减少，NMSE、SSIM和分类结果均有提升。

Conclusion: Att-ClassiGAN在CMI中表现出色，为图像重建和分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Computational microwave imaging (CMI) has gained attention as an alternative
technique for conventional microwave imaging techniques, addressing their
limitations such as hardware-intensive physical layer and slow data collection
acquisition speed to name a few. Despite these advantages, CMI still encounters
notable computational bottlenecks, especially during the image reconstruction
stage. In this setting, both image recovery and object classification present
significant processing demands. To address these challenges, our previous work
introduced ClassiGAN, which is a generative deep learning model designed to
simultaneously reconstruct images and classify targets using only
back-scattered signals. In this study, we build upon that framework by
incorporating attention gate modules into ClassiGAN. These modules are intended
to refine feature extraction and improve the identification of relevant
information. By dynamically focusing on important features and suppressing
irrelevant ones, the attention mechanism enhances the overall model
performance. The proposed architecture, named Att-ClassiGAN, significantly
reduces the reconstruction time compared to traditional CMI approaches.
Furthermore, it outperforms current advanced methods, delivering improved
Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE), higher Structural Similarity Index
(SSIM), and better classification outcomes for the reconstructed targets.

Conclusion: HiPerRAG通过高性能计算实现大规模科学知识整合，促进跨学科创新。

Abstract: The volume of scientific literature is growing exponentially, leading to
underutilized discoveries, duplicated efforts, and limited cross-disciplinary
collaboration. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a way to assist
scientists by improving the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
processing this influx of information. However, scaling RAG to handle millions
of articles introduces significant challenges, including the high computational
costs associated with parsing documents and embedding scientific knowledge, as
well as the algorithmic complexity of aligning these representations with the
nuanced semantics of scientific content. To address these issues, we introduce
HiPerRAG, a RAG workflow powered by high performance computing (HPC) to index
and retrieve knowledge from more than 3.6 million scientific articles. At its
core are Oreo, a high-throughput model for multimodal document parsing, and
ColTrast, a query-aware encoder fine-tuning algorithm that enhances retrieval
accuracy by using contrastive learning and late-interaction techniques.
HiPerRAG delivers robust performance on existing scientific question answering
benchmarks and two new benchmarks introduced in this work, achieving 90%
accuracy on SciQ and 76% on PubMedQA-outperforming both domain-specific models
like PubMedGPT and commercial LLMs such as GPT-4. Scaling to thousands of GPUs
on the Polaris, Sunspot, and Frontier supercomputers, HiPerRAG delivers million
document-scale RAG workflows for unifying scientific knowledge and fostering
interdisciplinary innovation.

Motivation: 研究LLM在推荐系统中的局限性，如上下文窗口限制、位置偏差，以及其在重排任务中的表现。

Method: 提出混合框架，结合传统推荐模型和LLM，通过结构化提示重排top-k项目，并评估用户历史重排和指令提示的效果。

Result: 实验显示随机化用户历史可提升排序质量，但LLM重排效果不及基础模型，且指令提示对减少位置偏差无效。

Conclusion: LLM在建模排序上下文和减少偏差方面存在局限性，需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for delivering personalized content across
digital platforms by modeling user preferences and behaviors. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to
their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training.
However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window
size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling
listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to
position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless
of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a
hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM
for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of
user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias.
Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves
ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model.
Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our
evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and
mitigate bias. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/aminul7506/LLMForReRanking.

Result: 在七个医学图像数据集上验证，CTO实现了最先进的准确性，同时保持模型复杂度竞争力。

Conclusion: CTO通过结合多种技术，显著提升了边界分割性能，且无需额外数据或标签注入。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a pivotal task within the realms of medical
image analysis and computer vision. While current methods have shown promise in
accurately segmenting major regions of interest, the precise segmentation of
boundary areas remains challenging. In this study, we propose a novel network
architecture named CTO, which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and explicit edge detection operators to
tackle this challenge. CTO surpasses existing methods in terms of segmentation
accuracy and strikes a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, without
the need for additional data inputs or label injections. Specifically, CTO
adheres to the canonical encoder-decoder network paradigm, with a dual-stream
encoder network comprising a mainstream CNN stream for capturing local features
and an auxiliary StitchViT stream for integrating long-range dependencies.
Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn boundary areas, we
introduce a boundary-guided decoder network that employs binary boundary masks
generated by dedicated edge detection operators to provide explicit guidance
during the decoding process. We validate the performance of CTO through
extensive experiments conducted on seven challenging medical image segmentation
datasets, namely ISIC 2016, PH2, ISIC 2018, CoNIC, LiTS17, and BTCV. Our
experimental results unequivocally demonstrate that CTO achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on these datasets while maintaining competitive model
complexity. The codes have been released at:

Abstract: Our study presents PNN-UNet as a method for constructing deep neural networks
that replicate the planarian neural network (PNN) structure in the context of
3D medical image data. Planarians typically have a cerebral structure
comprising two neural cords, where the cerebrum acts as a coordinator, and the
neural cords serve slightly different purposes within the organism's
neurological system. Accordingly, PNN-UNet comprises a Deep-UNet and a
Wide-UNet as the nerve cords, with a densely connected autoencoder performing
the role of the brain. This distinct architecture offers advantages over both
monolithic (UNet) and modular networks (Ensemble-UNet). Our outcomes on a 3D

PNN-UNet outperforms the baseline UNet and several other UNet variants in image
segmentation.

Abstract: This study presents an unsupervised, motion-resolved reconstruction framework
for high-resolution, free-breathing pulmonary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
utilizing a three-dimensional Gaussian representation (3DGS). The proposed
method leverages 3DGS to address the challenges of motion-resolved 3D isotropic
pulmonary MRI reconstruction by enabling data smoothing between voxels for
continuous spatial representation. Pulmonary MRI data acquisition is performed
using a golden-angle radial sampling trajectory, with respiratory motion
signals extracted from the center of k-space in each radial spoke. Based on the
estimated motion signal, the k-space data is sorted into multiple respiratory
phases. A 3DGS framework is then applied to reconstruct a reference image
volume from the first motion state. Subsequently, a patient-specific
convolutional neural network is trained to estimate the deformation vector
fields (DVFs), which are used to generate the remaining motion states through
spatial transformation of the reference volume. The proposed reconstruction
pipeline is evaluated on six datasets from six subjects and bench-marked
against three state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. The experimental
findings demonstrate that the proposed reconstruction framework effectively
reconstructs high-resolution, motion-resolved pulmonary MR images. Compared
with existing approaches, it achieves superior image quality, reflected by
higher signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio. The proposed
unsupervised 3DGS-based reconstruction method enables accurate motion-resolved
pulmonary MRI with isotropic spatial resolution. Its superior performance in
image quality metrics over state-of-the-art methods highlights its potential as
a robust solution for clinical pulmonary MR imaging.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
amyloid-beta plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, which serve as key
histopathological features. The identification and segmentation of these
lesions are crucial for understanding AD progression but remain challenging due
to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets and the impact of staining
variations on automated image analysis. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful
tool for pathology image segmentation; however, model performance is
significantly influenced by variations in staining characteristics,
necessitating effective stain normalization and enhancement techniques. In this
study, we address these challenges by introducing an open-source dataset
(ADNP-15) of neuritic plaques (i.e., amyloid deposits combined with a crown of
dystrophic tau-positive neurites) in human brain whole slide images. We
establish a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating five widely adopted deep
learning models across four stain normalization techniques, providing deeper
insights into their influence on neuritic plaque segmentation. Additionally, we
propose a novel image enhancement method that improves segmentation accuracy,
particularly in complex tissue structures, by enhancing structural details and
mitigating staining inconsistencies. Our experimental results demonstrate that
this enhancement strategy significantly boosts model generalization and
segmentation accuracy. All datasets and code are open-source, ensuring
transparency and reproducibility while enabling further advancements in the
field.

Abstract: The computational imaging technique of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM)
enables high-resolution imaging with a wide field of view and can serve as an
extremely valuable tool, e.g. in the classification of cells in medical
applications. However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even
hundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide
field of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying
the image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a
reconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can
extract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly
outperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %)
while being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a
high-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing
of several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy
while reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time)
significantly.

TLDR: RepSNet是一种基于核边界回归和结构重参数化的神经网络模型，用于H&E染色组织病理图像中的核分割与分类，解决了计算效率和重叠目标处理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理诊断是肿瘤诊断的金标准，核实例分割是数字病理分析和病理诊断的关键步骤，但计算效率和重叠目标处理是主要挑战。

Method: RepSNet通过核边界位置信息（BPI）估计和边界投票机制（BVM）实现核分割，采用结构重参数化技术减少模型参数和计算负担。

Result: 实验表明，RepSNet在多个典型基准模型上表现出优越性。

Conclusion: RepSNet通过宏观信息整合和结构优化，显著提升了核分割的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Pathological diagnosis is the gold standard for tumor diagnosis, and nucleus
instance segmentation is a key step in digital pathology analysis and
pathological diagnosis. However, the computational efficiency of the model and
the treatment of overlapping targets are the major challenges in the studies of
this problem. To this end, a neural network model RepSNet was designed based on
a nucleus boundary regression and a structural re-parameterization scheme for
segmenting and classifying the nuclei in H\&E-stained histopathological images.
First, RepSNet estimates the boundary position information (BPI) of the parent
nucleus for each pixel. The BPI estimation incorporates the local information
of the pixel and the contextual information of the parent nucleus. Then, the
nucleus boundary is estimated by aggregating the BPIs from a series of pixels
using a proposed boundary voting mechanism (BVM), and the instance segmentation
results are computed from the estimated nucleus boundary using a connected
component analysis procedure. The BVM intrinsically achieves a kind of
synergistic belief enhancement among the BPIs from various pixels. Therefore,
different from the methods available in literature that obtain nucleus
boundaries based on a direct pixel recognition scheme, RepSNet computes its
boundary decisions based on some guidances from macroscopic information using
an integration mechanism. In addition, RepSNet employs a re-parametrizable
encoder-decoder structure. This model can not only aggregate features from some
receptive fields with various scales which helps segmentation accuracy
improvement, but also reduce the parameter amount and computational burdens in
the model inference phase through the structural re-parameterization technique.
Extensive experiments demonstrated the superiorities of RepSNet compared to
several typical benchmark models.

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: 提出了一种CT引导的多剂量自适应注意力去噪扩散模型（MDAA-Diff），用于多剂量PET图像去噪，结合解剖学指导和剂量水平适应，显著提升了低剂量条件下的去噪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高剂量放射性示踪剂会增加辐射风险，而现有研究多关注单剂量去噪，忽略了患者间剂量响应差异和CT图像的解剖学约束。

Method: 采用CT引导的高频小波注意力模块（HWA）提取解剖边界特征，并通过剂量自适应注意力模块（DAA）动态整合剂量水平。

Result: 在18F-FDG和68Ga-FAPI数据集上，MDAA-Diff在低剂量条件下优于现有方法，保持了诊断质量。

Conclusion: MDAA-Diff通过结合解剖学指导和剂量适应机制，为低剂量PET图像去噪提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images requires
administering high-dose radiotracers, which increases radiation exposure risks.
Generating standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) has become a
potential solution. However, previous studies have primarily focused on single
low-dose PET denoising, neglecting two critical factors: discrepancies in dose
response caused by inter-patient variability, and complementary anatomical
constraints derived from CT images. In this work, we propose a novel CT-Guided
Multi-dose Adaptive Attention Denoising Diffusion Model (MDAA-Diff) for
multi-dose PET denoising. Our approach integrates anatomical guidance and
dose-level adaptation to achieve superior denoising performance under low-dose
conditions. Specifically, this approach incorporates a CT-Guided High-frequency
Wavelet Attention (HWA) module, which uses wavelet transforms to separate
high-frequency anatomical boundary features from CT images. These extracted
features are then incorporated into PET imaging through an adaptive weighted
fusion mechanism to enhance edge details. Additionally, we propose the
Dose-Adaptive Attention (DAA) module, a dose-conditioned enhancement mechanism
that dynamically integrates dose levels into channel-spatial attention weight
calculation. Extensive experiments on 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI datasets
demonstrate that MDAA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in
preserving diagnostic quality under reduced-dose conditions. Our code is
publicly available.

Abstract: Early detection and accurate diagnosis are essential to improving patient
outcomes. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tumor detection
has shown promise, but existing models often suffer from overparameterization,
which limits their performance gains. In this study, fuzzy sigmoid convolution
(FSC) is introduced along with two additional modules: top-of-the-funnel and
middle-of-the-funnel. The proposed methodology significantly reduces the number
of trainable parameters without compromising classification accuracy. A novel
convolutional operator is central to this approach, effectively dilating the
receptive field while preserving input data integrity. This enables efficient
feature map reduction and enhances the model's tumor detection capability. In
the FSC-based model, fuzzy sigmoid activation functions are incorporated within
convolutional layers to improve feature extraction and classification. The
inclusion of fuzzy logic into the architecture improves its adaptability and
robustness. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superior performance and efficiency of the proposed model. The FSC-based
architecture achieved classification accuracies of 99.17%, 99.75%, and 99.89%
on three different datasets. The model employs 100 times fewer parameters than
large-scale transfer learning architectures, highlighting its computational
efficiency and suitability for detecting brain tumors early. This research
offers lightweight, high-performance deep-learning models for medical imaging
applications.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers today, but it can be
prevented through early detection of malignant polyps in the colon, primarily
via colonoscopies. While this method has saved many lives, human error remains
a significant challenge, as missing a polyp could have fatal consequences for
the patient. Deep learning (DL) polyp detectors offer a promising solution.
However, existing DL polyp detectors often mistake white light reflections from
the endoscope for polyps, which can lead to false positives.To address this
challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that
artificially adds more white light reflections to create harder training
scenarios. Specifically, we first generate a bank of artificial lights using
the training dataset. Then we find the regions of the training images that we
should not add these artificial lights on. Finally, we propose a sliding window
method to add the artificial light to the areas that fit of the training
images, resulting in augmented images. By providing the model with more
opportunities to make mistakes, we hypothesize that it will also have more
chances to learn from those mistakes, ultimately improving its performance in
polyp detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our new
data augmentation method.

Result: 自然图像预训练的iBOT模型表现最佳（AUROC 0.80-0.97），优于领域特定模型（AUROC 0.78-0.96）和无预训练的基线ViT-L（AUROC 0.68-0.91）。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，基础模型在AMD识别中具有重要价值，挑战了领域内预训练的必要性假设，并发布了巴西的开放数据集BRAMD。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled Vision Transformers (ViTs) to
learn robust representations from large-scale natural image datasets, enhancing
their generalization across domains. In retinal imaging, foundation models
pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the
benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we
benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets
totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that
iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution
generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models,
which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining,
which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of
foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption
that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an
open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.

Result: SEVC有效缓解了大运动或新物体的处理问题，比特率比现有最优方法降低11.9%，并提供低分辨率比特流。

Conclusion: SEVC通过空间嵌入和时空优化，显著提升了视频编码的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Most Neural Video Codecs (NVCs) only employ temporal references to generate
temporal-only contexts and latent prior. These temporal-only NVCs fail to
handle large motions or emerging objects due to limited contexts and misaligned
latent prior. To relieve the limitations, we propose a Spatially Embedded Video
Codec (SEVC), in which the low-resolution video is compressed for spatial
references. Firstly, our SEVC leverages both spatial and temporal references to
generate augmented motion vectors and hybrid spatial-temporal contexts.
Secondly, to address the misalignment issue in latent prior and enrich the
prior information, we introduce a spatial-guided latent prior augmented by
multiple temporal latent representations. At last, we design a joint
spatial-temporal optimization to learn quality-adaptive bit allocation for
spatial references, further boosting rate-distortion performance. Experimental
results show that our SEVC effectively alleviates the limitations in handling
large motions or emerging objects, and also reduces 11.9% more bitrate than the
previous state-of-the-art NVC while providing an additional low-resolution
bitstream. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/EsakaK/SEVC.

Abstract: Estimating a child's age from ocular biometric images is challenging due to
subtle physiological changes and the limited availability of longitudinal
datasets. Although most biometric age estimation studies have focused on facial
features and adult subjects, pediatric-specific analysis, particularly of the
iris and periocular regions, remains relatively unexplored. This study presents
a comparative evaluation of iris and periocular images for estimating the ages
of children aged between 4 and 16 years. We utilized a longitudinal dataset
comprising more than 21,000 near-infrared (NIR) images, collected from 288
pediatric subjects over eight years using two different imaging sensors. A
multi-task deep learning framework was employed to jointly perform age
prediction and age-group classification, enabling a systematic exploration of
how different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, particularly
those adapted for non-square ocular inputs, capture the complex variability
inherent in pediatric eye images. The results show that periocular models
consistently outperform iris-based models, achieving a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 1.33 years and an age-group classification accuracy of 83.82%. These
results mark the first demonstration that reliable age estimation is feasible
from children's ocular images, enabling privacy-preserving age checks in
child-centric applications. This work establishes the first longitudinal
benchmark for pediatric ocular age estimation, providing a foundation for
designing robust, child-focused biometric systems. The developed models proved
resilient across different imaging sensors, confirming their potential for
real-world deployment. They also achieved inference speeds of less than 10
milliseconds per image on resource-constrained VR headsets, demonstrating their
suitability for real-time applications.

Motivation: 重新审视数据质量对模型质量的影响，探讨预训练和后训练协同设计的可能性，尤其是预训练数据中毒性数据比例对后训练控制的影响。

Method: 通过玩具实验研究数据组成对特征几何的影响，并在Olmo-1B模型上进行控制实验，调整干净和有毒数据的比例。

Conclusion: 结合后训练技术，预训练中使用有毒数据可能产生更好的模型，实现毒性降低与通用能力的平衡。

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) pretraining, data quality is believed to
determine model quality. In this paper, we re-examine the notion of "quality"
from the perspective of pre- and post-training co-design. Specifically, we
explore the possibility that pre-training on more toxic data can lead to better
control in post-training, ultimately decreasing a model's output toxicity.
First, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the
geometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled
experiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic
data, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear
representation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show
that although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model,
it also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real
Toxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better
trade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general
capabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention
(ITI) are applied. Our findings suggest that, with post-training taken into
account, bad data may lead to good models.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但常因冗余内容导致输出冗长，增加计算开销并降低用户体验。现有压缩方法存在破坏推理连贯性或无法有效干预生成的问题。

Method: 提出ConCISE框架，通过信心注入稳定中间步骤，并在信心足够时提前终止推理，避免冗余步骤的生成。

Result: 实验表明，ConCISE能将输出长度减少约50%，同时保持高任务准确性，并在多个推理基准测试中优于现有基线。

Conclusion: ConCISE通过信心引导的压缩方法，有效解决了LRMs输出冗长的问题，提升了推理效率和用户体验。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) perform strongly in complex reasoning tasks via
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but often suffer from verbose outputs caused
by redundant content, increasing computational overhead, and degrading user
experience. Existing compression methods either operate post-hoc pruning,
risking disruption to reasoning coherence, or rely on sampling-based selection,
which fails to intervene effectively during generation. In this work, we
introduce a confidence-guided perspective to explain the emergence of redundant
reflection in LRMs, identifying two key patterns: Confidence Deficit, where the
model reconsiders correct steps due to low internal confidence, and Termination
Delay, where reasoning continues even after reaching a confident answer. Based
on this analysis, we propose ConCISE (Confidence-guided Compression In
Step-by-step Efficient Reasoning), a framework that simplifies reasoning chains
by reinforcing the model's confidence during inference, thus preventing the
generation of redundant reflection steps. It integrates Confidence Injection to
stabilize intermediate steps and Early Stopping to terminate reasoning when
confidence is sufficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
LRMs on ConCISE-generated data yields significantly shorter outputs, reducing
length by up to approximately 50% under SimPO, while maintaining high task
accuracy. ConCISE consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: GT是一种有效的自适应变换方法，适用于多样化学习场景。

Abstract: Discrete transforms, such as the discrete Fourier transform, are widely used
in machine learning to improve model performance by extracting meaningful
features. However, with numerous transforms available, selecting an appropriate
one often depends on understanding the dataset's properties, making the
approach less effective when such knowledge is unavailable. In this work, we
propose General Transform (GT), an adaptive transform-based representation
designed for machine learning applications. Unlike conventional transforms, GT
learns data-driven mapping tailored to the dataset and task of interest. Here,
we demonstrate that models incorporating GT outperform conventional
transform-based approaches across computer vision and natural language
processing tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in diverse learning scenarios.

Conclusion: CodeMixBench为多语言代码生成提供了现实评估框架，揭示了构建鲁棒模型的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code
generation tasks, powering various applications like code completion,
debugging, and programming assistance. However, existing benchmarks such as
HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench primarily evaluate LLMs on English-only
prompts, overlooking the real-world scenario where multilingual developers
often use code-mixed language while interacting with LLMs. To address this gap,
we introduce CodeMixBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness of LLMs on code generation from code-mixed prompts. Built upon
BigCodeBench, CodeMixBench introduces controlled code-mixing (CMD) into the
natural language parts of prompts across three language pairs: Hinglish
(Hindi-English), Spanish-English, and Chinese Pinyin-English. We
comprehensively evaluate a diverse set of open-source code generation models
ranging from 1.5B to 15B parameters. Our results show that code-mixed prompts
consistently degrade Pass@1 performance compared to their English-only
counterparts, with performance drops increasing under higher CMD levels for
smaller models. CodeMixBench provides a realistic evaluation framework for
studying multilingual code generation and highlights new challenges and
directions for building robust code generation models that generalize well
across diverse linguistic settings.

Abstract: To perform in-context learning, language models must extract signals from
individual few-shot examples, aggregate these into a learned prediction rule,
and then apply this rule to new examples. How is this implemented in the
forward pass of modern transformer models? To study this, we consider a
structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule
is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We find that Llama-3-8B attains high
accuracy on this task for a range of $k$, and localize its few-shot ability to
just three attention heads via a novel optimization approach. We further show
the extracted signals lie in a six-dimensional subspace, where four of the
dimensions track the unit digit and the other two dimensions track overall
magnitude. We finally examine how these heads extract information from
individual few-shot examples, identifying a self-correction mechanism in which
mistakes from earlier examples are suppressed by later examples. Our results
demonstrate how tracking low-dimensional subspaces across a forward pass can
provide insight into fine-grained computational structures.

Abstract: Text watermarking aims to subtly embed statistical signals into text by
controlling the Large Language Model (LLM)'s sampling process, enabling
watermark detectors to verify that the output was generated by the specified
model. The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor
in evaluating their effectiveness. Current text watermarking algorithms embed
watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality. In this paper, we
reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing
a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. We introduce a generic
efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA),
which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each
token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack. Our
work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking
algorithms. The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack
success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per
million tokens cost. Our approach does not require any access to the watermark
algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the
attack model, even mobile-level models. Our findings highlight the urgent need
for more robust watermarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂任务上表现优异，但其不可控的输出长度在实时部署中面临挑战。

Method: 提出Elastic Reasoning框架，分两阶段（思考和解决）分配预算，并引入轻量级预算约束策略训练模型。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，Elastic Reasoning在严格预算下表现稳健，且训练成本更低。

Conclusion: Elastic Reasoning为可控推理提供了实用解决方案，即使在无约束条件下也能生成更简洁的推理。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex
tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their
uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are
strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for
scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two
phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test
time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments,
significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train
models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight
budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the
model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and
generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional
training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming
(LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning
performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring
significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our
approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in
unconstrained settings. Elastic Reasoning offers a principled and practical
solution to the pressing challenge of controllable reasoning at scale.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的异常检测框架，通过结合重建误差和语义差异作为异常指标，在多模态数据上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法在处理复杂高维数据时存在局限性，扩散模型具有潜力解决这一问题。

Method: 利用扩散概率模型（DPMs）建模正常数据分布，通过反向扩散重建输入数据，并结合多尺度特征提取、注意力机制和小波域表示。

Result: 在MVTec AD和UrbanSound8K等基准数据集上，该方法优于现有技术，表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在异常检测中具有显著效果，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task in machine learning and data mining,
with significant applications in cybersecurity, industrial fault diagnosis, and
clinical disease monitoring. Traditional methods, such as statistical modeling
and machine learning-based approaches, often face challenges in handling
complex, high-dimensional data distributions. In this study, we explore the
potential of diffusion models for anomaly detection, proposing a novel
framework that leverages the strengths of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs)
to effectively identify anomalies in both image and audio data. The proposed
method models the distribution of normal data through a diffusion process and
reconstructs input data via reverse diffusion, using a combination of
reconstruction errors and semantic discrepancies as anomaly indicators. To
enhance the framework's performance, we introduce multi-scale feature
extraction, attention mechanisms, and wavelet-domain representations, enabling
the model to capture fine-grained structures and global dependencies in the
data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MVTec AD and
UrbanSound8K, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly
detection techniques, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse
data modalities. This research highlights the effectiveness of diffusion models
in anomaly detection and provides a robust and efficient solution for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出CUDA框架，通过对抗训练对齐概念表示，引入松弛阈值适应域差异，无需目标域标签即可推断概念，提升CBMs的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）假设训练和测试数据分布相同，但实际中域偏移会导致性能下降和泛化能力差。

Method: 提出CUDA框架：1）对抗训练对齐概念表示；2）松弛阈值允许域间概念分布差异；3）无标签推断目标域概念；4）理论保证下结合概念学习与传统域适应。

Result: 实验表明，CUDA在真实数据集上显著优于现有CBM和域适应方法。

Conclusion: CUDA框架有效解决了CBMs在域偏移下的问题，提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，同时保持可解释性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by explaining
predictions through human-understandable concepts but typically assume that
training and test data share the same distribution. This assumption often fails
under domain shifts, leading to degraded performance and poor generalization.
To address these limitations and improve the robustness of CBMs, we propose the
Concept-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CUDA) framework. CUDA is designed
to: (1) align concept representations across domains using adversarial
training, (2) introduce a relaxation threshold to allow minor domain-specific
differences in concept distributions, thereby preventing performance drop due
to over-constraints of these distributions, (3) infer concepts directly in the
target domain without requiring labeled concept data, enabling CBMs to adapt to
diverse domains, and (4) integrate concept learning into conventional domain
adaptation (DA) with theoretical guarantees, improving interpretability and
establishing new benchmarks for DA. Experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CBM and DA methods on real-world
datasets.

TLDR: MTL-UE是首个针对多任务数据和模型生成不可学习样本的统一框架，通过生成器结构和嵌入正则化显著提升攻击性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不可学习策略主要针对单任务学习，而多任务学习模型的重要性日益增长，但相关策略研究不足。

Method: 设计基于生成器的结构，引入标签先验和类特征嵌入，结合任务内和任务间嵌入正则化。

Result: 在4个多任务数据集、3种基础UE方法、5种模型架构和5种任务加权策略中表现优异。

Conclusion: MTL-UE在多任务学习中表现出强大的攻击性能和通用性。

Abstract: Most existing unlearnable strategies focus on preventing unauthorized users
from training single-task learning (STL) models with personal data.
Nevertheless, the paradigm has recently shifted towards multi-task data and
multi-task learning (MTL), targeting generalist and foundation models that can
handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Despite their growing importance, MTL
data and models have been largely neglected while pursuing unlearnable
strategies. This paper presents MTL-UE, the first unified framework for
generating unlearnable examples for multi-task data and MTL models. Instead of
optimizing perturbations for each sample, we design a generator-based structure
that introduces label priors and class-wise feature embeddings which leads to
much better attacking performance. In addition, MTL-UE incorporates intra-task
and inter-task embedding regularization to increase inter-class separation and
suppress intra-class variance which enhances the attack robustness greatly.
Furthermore, MTL-UE is versatile with good supports for dense prediction tasks
in MTL. It is also plug-and-play allowing integrating existing
surrogate-dependent unlearnable methods with little adaptation. Extensive
experiments show that MTL-UE achieves superior attacking performance
consistently across 4 MTL datasets, 3 base UE methods, 5 model backbones, and 5
MTL task-weighting strategies.

systematically benchmark both open- and closed-source foundation models,
incorporating expert-driven human evaluations conducted by doctoral-level
experts. Furthermore, we improve model performance through targeted prompt

apply test-time computational scaling to enhance the reasoning capabilities of
LMMs, achieving superior accuracy compared to human-expert corrections. We also
explore the potential of using LMM Agents to generate scientific hypotheses

Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在个体文化知识上存在显著差距，可能导致错误结果和刻板印象，因此需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于文化代码的数据集收集和处理方法，并以俄罗斯文化为例进行验证。

Result: 通过人类评估，模型在俄罗斯文化领域的生成质量有所提升。

Conclusion: 研究强调了文化代码理解的重要性，并验证了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Despite the fact that popular text-to-image generation models cope well with
international and general cultural queries, they have a significant knowledge
gap regarding individual cultures. This is due to the content of existing large
training datasets collected on the Internet, which are predominantly based on
Western European or American popular culture. Meanwhile, the lack of cultural
adaptation of the model can lead to incorrect results, a decrease in the
generation quality, and the spread of stereotypes and offensive content. In an
effort to address this issue, we examine the concept of cultural code and
recognize the critical importance of its understanding by modern image
generation models, an issue that has not been sufficiently addressed in the
research community to date. We propose the methodology for collecting and
processing the data necessary to form a dataset based on the cultural code, in
particular the Russian one. We explore how the collected data affects the
quality of generations in the national domain and analyze the effectiveness of
our approach using the Kandinsky 3.1 text-to-image model. Human evaluation
results demonstrate an increase in the level of awareness of Russian culture in
the model.

Abstract: Transformer-decoder language models are a core innovation in text based
generative artificial intelligence. These models are being deployed as
general-purpose intelligence systems in many applications. Central to their
utility is the capacity to understand natural language commands and exploit the
reasoning embedded in human text corpora to apply some form of reasoning
process to a wide variety of novel tasks. To understand the limitations of this
approach to generating reasoning we argue that we need to consider the
architectural constraints of these systems. Consideration of the latent
variable structure of transformer-decoder models allows us to design reasoning
tasks that should probe the boundary of their capacity to reason. We present
enigme, an open-source library for generating text-based puzzles to be used in
training and evaluating reasoning skills within transformer-decoder models and
future AI architectures.

Result: 工具支持多种模型架构，并在四个用例中展示了其功能，包括生成类别层次结构、发现错误标签等。

Conclusion: ChannelExplorer为理解DNN内部行为提供了有效工具，并通过专家评估验证了其实用性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in many
vision tasks, yet understanding their internal behavior remains challenging,
particularly how different layers and activation channels contribute to class
separability. We introduce ChannelExplorer, an interactive visual analytics
tool for analyzing image-based outputs across model layers, emphasizing
data-driven insights over architecture analysis for exploring class
separability. ChannelExplorer summarizes activations across layers and
visualizes them using three primary coordinated views: a Scatterplot View to
reveal inter- and intra-class confusion, a Jaccard Similarity View to quantify
activation overlap, and a Heatmap View to inspect activation channel patterns.
Our technique supports diverse model architectures, including CNNs, GANs,
ResNet and Stable Diffusion models. We demonstrate the capabilities of
ChannelExplorer through four use-case scenarios: (1) generating class hierarchy
in ImageNet, (2) finding mislabeled images, (3) identifying activation channel
contributions, and(4) locating latent states' position in Stable Diffusion
model. Finally, we evaluate the tool with expert users.

Conclusion: WIR3D提供了一种高效且可控的3D形状抽象方法，适用于多种下游应用。

Abstract: We present WIR3D, a technique for abstracting 3D shapes through a sparse set
of visually meaningful curves in 3D. We optimize the parameters of Bezier
curves such that they faithfully represent both the geometry and salient visual
features (e.g. texture) of the shape from arbitrary viewpoints. We leverage the
intermediate activations of a pre-trained foundation model (CLIP) to guide our
optimization process. We divide our optimization into two phases: one for
capturing the coarse geometry of the shape, and the other for representing
fine-grained features. Our second phase supervision is spatially guided by a
novel localized keypoint loss. This spatial guidance enables user control over
abstracted features. We ensure fidelity to the original surface through a
neural SDF loss, which allows the curves to be used as intuitive deformation
handles. We successfully apply our method for shape abstraction over a broad
dataset of shapes with varying complexity, geometric structure, and texture,
and demonstrate downstream applications for feature control and shape
deformation.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems, which require the simultaneous
optimization of multiple terms, are prevalent across numerous applications.
Existing multi-objective optimization methods often rely on manually tuned
aggregation functions to formulate a joint optimization target. The performance
of such hand-tuned methods is heavily dependent on careful weight selection, a
time-consuming and laborious process. These limitations also arise in the
setting of reinforcement-learning-based motion tracking for physically
simulated characters, where intricately crafted reward functions are typically
used to achieve high-fidelity results. Such solutions not only require domain
expertise and significant manual adjustment, but also limit the applicability
of the resulting reward function across diverse skills. To bridge this gap, we
present a novel adversarial multi-objective optimization technique that is
broadly applicable to a range of multi-objective optimization problems,
including motion tracking. The proposed adversarial differential discriminator
receives a single positive sample, yet is still effective at guiding the
optimization process. We demonstrate that our technique can enable characters
to closely replicate a variety of acrobatic and agile behaviors, achieving
comparable quality to state-of-the-art motion-tracking methods, without relying
on manually tuned reward functions. Results are best visualized through

Abstract: Full-body gestures play a pivotal role in natural interactions and are
crucial for achieving effective communication. Nevertheless, most existing
studies primarily focus on the gesture generation of speakers, overlooking the
vital role of listeners in the interaction process and failing to fully explore
the dynamic interaction between them. This paper innovatively proposes an
Inter-Diffusion Generation Model of Speakers and Listeners for Effective
Communication. For the first time, we integrate the full-body gestures of
listeners into the generation framework. By devising a novel inter-diffusion
mechanism, this model can accurately capture the complex interaction patterns
between speakers and listeners during communication. In the model construction
process, based on the advanced diffusion model architecture, we innovatively
introduce interaction conditions and the GAN model to increase the denoising
step size. As a result, when generating gesture sequences, the model can not
only dynamically generate based on the speaker's speech information but also
respond in realtime to the listener's feedback, enabling synergistic
interaction between the two. Abundant experimental results demonstrate that
compared with the current state-of-the-art gesture generation methods, the
model we proposed has achieved remarkable improvements in the naturalness,
coherence, and speech-gesture synchronization of the generated gestures. In the
subjective evaluation experiments, users highly praised the generated
interaction scenarios, believing that they are closer to real life human
communication situations. Objective index evaluations also show that our model
outperforms the baseline methods in multiple key indicators, providing more
powerful support for effective communication.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an active contour model for silhouette
vectorization using cubic B\'ezier curves. Among the end points of the B\'ezier
curves, we distinguish between corner and regular points where the orientation
of the tangent vector is prescribed. By minimizing the distance of the B\'ezier
curves to the silhouette boundary, the active contour model optimizes the
location of the B\'ezier curves end points, the orientation of the tangent
vectors in the regular points, and the estimation of the B\'ezier curve
parameters. This active contour model can use the silhouette vectorization
obtained by any method as an initial guess. The proposed method significantly
reduces the average distance between the silhouette boundary and its
vectorization obtained by the world-class graphic software Inkscape, Adobe
Illustrator, and a curvature-based vectorization method, which we introduce for
comparison. Our method also allows us to impose additional regularity on the
B\'ezier curves by reducing their lengths.

Abstract: We present a method to reconstruct dynamic scenes from monocular
continuous-wave time-of-flight (C-ToF) cameras using raw sensor samples that
achieves similar or better accuracy than neural volumetric approaches and is
100x faster. Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a
single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF
radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly
measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and
underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based
scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with
multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its
optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to
improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians. Experimental
results show that our approach produces accurate reconstructions under
constrained C-ToF sensing conditions, including for fast motions like swinging
baseball bats. https://visual.cs.brown.edu/gftorf
