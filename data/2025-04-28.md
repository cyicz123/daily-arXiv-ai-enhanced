### [1] [Optimism, Expectation, or Sarcasm? Multi-Class Hope Speech Detection in Spanish and English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17974)
*Sabur Butt,Fazlourrahman Balouchzahi,Ahmad Imam Amjad,Maaz Amjad,Hector G. Ceballos,Salud Maria Jimenez-Zafra*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文介绍了PolyHope V2数据集，用于多语言、细粒度的希望语音检测，并比较了预训练模型与大型语言模型在零样本和少样本下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望是一种复杂且未被充分探索的情感状态，在教育、心理健康和社交互动中具有重要作用，但其在自然语言处理中的检测存在挑战。

Method: 研究使用PolyHope V2数据集（包含30,000条标注的英语和西班牙语推文），区分四种希望子类型，并比较了预训练模型与大型语言模型（如GPT-4和Llama 3）的表现。

Result: 微调的预训练模型在区分细微的希望类别和讽刺方面优于基于提示的大型语言模型。

Conclusion: 该数据集和结果为未来需要跨语言语义和上下文敏感性的情感识别任务提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Hope is a complex and underexplored emotional state that plays a significant
role in education, mental health, and social interaction. Unlike basic
emotions, hope manifests in nuanced forms ranging from grounded optimism to
exaggerated wishfulness or sarcasm, making it difficult for Natural Language
Processing systems to detect accurately. This study introduces PolyHope V2, a
multilingual, fine-grained hope speech dataset comprising over 30,000 annotated
tweets in English and Spanish. This resource distinguishes between four hope
subtypes Generalized, Realistic, Unrealistic, and Sarcastic and enhances
existing datasets by explicitly labeling sarcastic instances. We benchmark
multiple pretrained transformer models and compare them with large language
models (LLMs) such as GPT 4 and Llama 3 under zero-shot and few-shot regimes.
Our findings show that fine-tuned transformers outperform prompt-based LLMs,
especially in distinguishing nuanced hope categories and sarcasm. Through
qualitative analysis and confusion matrices, we highlight systematic challenges
in separating closely related hope subtypes. The dataset and results provide a
robust foundation for future emotion recognition tasks that demand greater
semantic and contextual sensitivity across languages.

### [2] [Improving LLM Personas via Rationalization with Psychological Scaffolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17993)
*Brihi Joshi,Xiang Ren,Swabha Swayamdipta,Rik Koncel-Kedziorski,Tim Paek*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: PB&J框架通过心理学理论增强LLM人物角色，生成用户判断的理性解释，提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于用户属性或判断的人物角色方法未能捕捉判断背后的原因，需改进。

Method: 引入PB&J框架，结合心理学理论（如大五人格）生成用户判断的理性解释。

Result: PB&J增强的LLM人物角色在预测任务中优于仅基于属性或判断的方法，且与人工解释效果相当。

Conclusion: PB&J通过心理学理论提升LLM人物角色的解释能力，显著改进预测性能。

Abstract: Language models prompted with a user description or persona can predict a
user's preferences and opinions, but existing approaches to building personas
-- based solely on a user's demographic attributes and/or prior judgments --
fail to capture the underlying reasoning behind said user judgments. We
introduce PB&J (Psychology of Behavior and Judgments), a framework that
improves LLM personas by incorporating rationales of why a user might make
specific judgments. These rationales are LLM-generated, and aim to reason about
a user's behavior on the basis of their experiences, personality traits or
beliefs. This is done using psychological scaffolds -- structured frameworks
grounded in theories such as the Big 5 Personality Traits and Primal World
Beliefs -- that help provide structure to the generated rationales. Experiments
on public opinion and movie preference prediction tasks demonstrate that LLM
personas augmented with PB&J rationales consistently outperform methods using
only a user's demographics and/or judgments. Additionally, LLM personas
constructed using scaffolds describing user beliefs perform competitively with
those using human-written rationales.

### [3] [Memory Reviving, Continuing Learning and Beyond: Evaluation of Pre-trained Encoders and Decoders for Multimodal Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18012)
*Zhuang Yu,Shiliang Sun,Jing Zhao,Tengfei Song,Hao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文系统研究了预训练编码器和解码器在多模态机器翻译中的作用，发现预训练解码器显著提升翻译质量，而编码器的效果取决于视觉-文本对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练语言和视觉模型在多模态机器翻译中的效果和作用，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 在统一的多模态翻译框架下，分析不同训练策略（从零训练到使用预训练和部分冻结组件）对翻译性能的影响。

Result: 预训练在多模态环境中起关键但不对称作用：解码器提升翻译流畅性和准确性，编码器效果因视觉-文本对齐质量而异。

Conclusion: 研究为多模态翻译系统的未来架构设计提供了指导，强调了预训练组件与模态融合的交互作用。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) aims to improve translation quality by
leveraging auxiliary modalities such as images alongside textual input. While
recent advances in large-scale pre-trained language and vision models have
significantly benefited unimodal natural language processing tasks, their
effectiveness and role in MMT remain underexplored. In this work, we conduct a
systematic study on the impact of pre-trained encoders and decoders in
multimodal translation models. Specifically, we analyze how different training
strategies, from training from scratch to using pre-trained and partially
frozen components, affect translation performance under a unified MMT
framework. Experiments are carried out on the Multi30K and CoMMuTE dataset
across English-German and English-French translation tasks. Our results reveal
that pre-training plays a crucial yet asymmetrical role in multimodal settings:
pre-trained decoders consistently yield more fluent and accurate outputs, while
pre-trained encoders show varied effects depending on the quality of
visual-text alignment. Furthermore, we provide insights into the interplay
between modality fusion and pre-trained components, offering guidance for
future architecture design in multimodal translation systems.

### [4] [RAG LLMs are Not Safer: A Safety Analysis of Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18041)
*Bang An,Shiyue Zhang,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究发现，RAG框架可能降低LLMs的安全性，且现有安全评估方法在RAG环境下效果较差，需针对性研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RAG框架对LLM安全性的影响，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 对11种LLMs进行RAG与非RAG框架的对比分析，评估安全性和现有红队方法效果。

Result: RAG可能降低模型安全性，安全模型与文档组合仍可能生成不安全内容，现有红队方法在RAG中效果较差。

Conclusion: 需针对RAG LLMs开发专门的安全研究和红队方法。

Abstract: Efforts to ensure the safety of large language models (LLMs) include safety
fine-tuning, evaluation, and red teaming. However, despite the widespread use
of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, AI safety work focuses
on standard LLMs, which means we know little about how RAG use cases change a
model's safety profile. We conduct a detailed comparative analysis of RAG and
non-RAG frameworks with eleven LLMs. We find that RAG can make models less safe
and change their safety profile. We explore the causes of this change and find
that even combinations of safe models with safe documents can cause unsafe
generations. In addition, we evaluate some existing red teaming methods for RAG
settings and show that they are less effective than when used for non-RAG
settings. Our work highlights the need for safety research and red-teaming
methods specifically tailored for RAG LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出DREAM方法，通过多模态风险解耦和强化学习提升MLLMs的安全性，实验显示效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）因结合视觉和文本数据而面临新的安全挑战，需要系统性解决方案。

Method: 采用多模态风险解耦分析，结合监督微调和迭代强化学习（RLAIF）提出DREAM方法。

Result: DREAM显著提升安全性，SIUO安全&有效性评分比GPT-4V提高16.17%，且不影响正常任务表现。

Conclusion: DREAM为MLLMs的安全对齐提供了有效解决方案，实验验证其优越性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pose unique safety challenges due to
their integration of visual and textual data, thereby introducing new
dimensions of potential attacks and complex risk combinations. In this paper,
we begin with a detailed analysis aimed at disentangling risks through
step-by-step reasoning within multimodal inputs. We find that systematic
multimodal risk disentanglement substantially enhances the risk awareness of
MLLMs. Via leveraging the strong discriminative abilities of multimodal risk
disentanglement, we further introduce \textbf{DREAM}
(\textit{\textbf{D}isentangling \textbf{R}isks to \textbf{E}nhance Safety
\textbf{A}lignment in \textbf{M}LLMs}), a novel approach that enhances safety
alignment in MLLMs through supervised fine-tuning and iterative Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). Experimental results show that DREAM
significantly boosts safety during both inference and training phases without
compromising performance on normal tasks (namely oversafety), achieving a
16.17\% improvement in the SIUO safe\&effective score compared to GPT-4V. The
data and code are available at https://github.com/Kizna1ver/DREAM.

### [6] [Exploring Personality-Aware Interactions in Salesperson Dialogue Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18058)
*Sijia Cheng,Wen-Yu Chang,Yun-Nung Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究探讨了MBTI定义的用户角色对销售导向对话代理交互质量和性能的影响，发现交互动态、任务完成率和对话自然性存在显著模式，并提供了可扩展的个性化对话系统工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同用户角色如何影响销售领域对话代理的交互质量和性能，以提升其适应性和个性化能力。

Method: 通过大规模测试和分析，评估预训练代理在不同MBTI用户类型中的有效性、适应性和个性化能力。

Result: 揭示了交互动态、任务完成率和对话自然性的显著模式，并开发了不受领域限制的用户模拟器。

Conclusion: 研究为构建更适应和用户中心的对话系统提供了实用见解，并展示了个性化对话系统在多领域应用的潜力。

Abstract: The integration of dialogue agents into the sales domain requires a deep
understanding of how these systems interact with users possessing diverse
personas. This study explores the influence of user personas, defined using the
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), on the interaction quality and performance
of sales-oriented dialogue agents. Through large-scale testing and analysis, we
assess the pre-trained agent's effectiveness, adaptability, and personalization
capabilities across a wide range of MBTI-defined user types. Our findings
reveal significant patterns in interaction dynamics, task completion rates, and
dialogue naturalness, underscoring the future potential for dialogue agents to
refine their strategies to better align with varying personality traits. This
work not only provides actionable insights for building more adaptive and
user-centric conversational systems in the sales domain but also contributes
broadly to the field by releasing persona-defined user simulators. These
simulators, unconstrained by domain, offer valuable tools for future research
and demonstrate the potential for scaling personalized dialogue systems across
diverse applications.

### [7] [PropRAG: Guiding Retrieval with Beam Search over Proposition Paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18070)
*Jingjin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: PropRAG是一种基于命题的检索增强生成框架，通过图遍历和预计算嵌入实现高效的多步推理链发现，避免了在线LLM推理成本，并在多个数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RAG方法无法捕捉人类记忆的关联性和上下文理解能力，而现有的结构化RAG方法（如HippoRAG）因上下文丢失而受限。PropRAG旨在通过丰富的命题表示和显式路径发现解决这些问题。

Method: PropRAG利用上下文丰富的命题和新颖的束搜索算法，通过图遍历和预计算嵌入发现多步推理链，完全避免在线LLM推理。

Result: PropRAG在PopQA、2Wiki、HotpotQA和MuSiQue等数据集上取得了最先进的零样本Recall@5和F1分数。

Conclusion: PropRAG通过改进证据检索和显式路径发现，推动了非参数持续学习的进展。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become the standard non-parametric
approach for equipping Large Language Models (LLMs) with up-to-date knowledge
and mitigating catastrophic forgetting common in continual learning. However,
standard RAG, relying on independent passage retrieval, fails to capture the
interconnected nature of human memory crucial for complex reasoning
(associativity) and contextual understanding (sense-making). While structured
RAG methods like HippoRAG utilize knowledge graphs (KGs) built from triples,
the inherent context loss limits fidelity. We introduce PropRAG, a framework
leveraging contextually rich propositions and a novel beam search algorithm
over proposition paths to explicitly discover multi-step reasoning chains.
Crucially, PropRAG's online retrieval process operates entirely without
invoking generative LLMs, relying instead on efficient graph traversal and
pre-computed embeddings. This avoids online LLM inference costs and potential
inconsistencies during evidence gathering. LLMs are used effectively offline
for high-quality proposition extraction and post-retrieval for answer
generation. PropRAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot Recall@5 results on
PopQA (55.3%), 2Wiki (93.7%), HotpotQA (97.0%), and MuSiQue (77.3%), alongside
top F1 scores (e.g., 52.4% on MuSiQue). By improving evidence retrieval through
richer representation and explicit, LLM-free online path finding, PropRAG
advances non-parametric continual learning.

### [8] [Stabilizing Reasoning in Medical LLMs with Continued Pretraining and Reasoning Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18080)
*Wataru Kawakami,Keita Suzuki,Junichiro Iwasawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文介绍了Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B，一个针对日本医学领域优化的72B参数模型，通过两阶段微调实现高准确性和稳定推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医学领域潜力巨大，但临床采用受限于事实准确性、语言限制（如日语）以及生成可靠推理解释的能力。

Method: 采用两阶段微调：1）继续预训练（CPT）以注入领域知识；2）推理偏好优化（RPO）以提升可靠推理生成。

Result: 在IgakuQA基准测试中达到0.868准确率，优于GPT-4o，且在生成解释时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: 优化可靠解释与准确性同等重要，模型权重已开源以促进可信赖LLM研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in medicine, yet clinical
adoption is hindered by concerns over factual accuracy, language-specific
limitations (e.g., Japanese), and critically, their reliability when required
to generate reasoning explanations -- a prerequisite for trust. This paper
introduces Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B, a 72B-parameter model optimized for the
Japanese medical domain to achieve both high accuracy and stable reasoning. We
employ a two-stage fine-tuning process on the Qwen2.5-72B base model: first,
Continued Pretraining (CPT) on a comprehensive Japanese medical corpus instills
deep domain knowledge. Second, Reasoning Preference Optimization (RPO), a
preference-based method, enhances the generation of reliable reasoning pathways
while preserving high answer accuracy. Evaluations on the Japanese Medical
Licensing Exam benchmark (IgakuQA) show Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B achieves
state-of-the-art performance (0.868 accuracy), surpassing strong proprietary
models like GPT-4o (0.866). Crucially, unlike baseline or CPT-only models which
exhibit significant accuracy degradation (up to 11.5\% and 3.8\% respectively
on IgakuQA) when prompted for explanations, our model maintains its high
accuracy (0.868) under such conditions. This highlights RPO's effectiveness in
stabilizing reasoning generation. This work underscores the importance of
optimizing for reliable explanations alongside accuracy. We release the
Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B model weights to foster research into trustworthy
LLMs for specialized, high-stakes applications.

*Muhammad Mubashar,Shireen Kudukkil Manchingal,Fabio Cuzzolin*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种随机集大语言模型（RSLLM），用于量化LLM生成文本的不确定性，通过预测有限随机集而非传统概率向量，并结合层次聚类方法提高效率。实验表明RSLLM在CoQA和OBQA数据集上表现优于标准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM生成文本的可信度问题，提出量化其不确定性的需求。

Method: 提出RSLLM方法，预测有限随机集（置信函数），并基于层次聚类提取关键子集以提高效率。

Result: 在CoQA和OBQA数据集上，RSLLM表现优于标准模型，并能有效估计预测的二级不确定性及检测幻觉。

Conclusion: RSLLM为LLM的不确定性量化提供了有效方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce very high-quality tests and
responses to our queries. But how much can we trust this generated text? In
this paper, we study the problem of uncertainty quantification in LLMs. We
propose a novel Random-Set Large Language Model (RSLLM) approach which predicts
finite random sets (belief functions) over the token space, rather than
probability vectors as in classical LLMs. In order to allow so efficiently, we
also present a methodology based on hierarchical clustering to extract and use
a budget of "focal" subsets of tokens upon which the belief prediction is
defined, rather than using all possible collections of tokens, making the
method scalable yet effective. RS-LLMs encode the epistemic uncertainty induced
in their generation process by the size and diversity of its training set via
the size of the credal sets associated with the predicted belief functions. The
proposed approach is evaluated on CoQA and OBQA datasets using Llama2-7b,
Mistral-7b and Phi-2 models and is shown to outperform the standard model in
both datasets in terms of correctness of answer while also showing potential in
estimating the second level uncertainty in its predictions and providing the
capability to detect when its hallucinating.

### [10] [Application and Optimization of Large Models Based on Prompt Tuning for Fact-Check-Worthiness Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18104)
*Yinglong Yu,Hao Shen,Zhengyi Lyu,Qi He*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于提示调优的事实核查价值估计分类方法，通过设计提示模板和大语言模型结合，提升了在有限或无标签数据下的分类准确性。实验表明，该方法在F1分数和准确率等指标上优于或匹配多种基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对全球化和信息化背景下日益严重的虚假信息问题，研究旨在提高事实核查价值估计的准确性，尤其是在数据有限或无标签的情况下。

Method: 采用提示调优技术，设计提示模板并应用于大语言模型，实现上下文学习，优化事实核查价值估计的分类任务。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在F1分数和准确率等指标上优于或匹配BERT、GPT-3.5和GPT-4等基线模型。

Conclusion: 基于提示调优的方法在事实核查价值估计任务中表现出有效性和先进性，为处理虚假信息提供了新思路。

Abstract: In response to the growing problem of misinformation in the context of
globalization and informatization, this paper proposes a classification method
for fact-check-worthiness estimation based on prompt tuning. We construct a
model for fact-check-worthiness estimation at the methodological level using
prompt tuning. By applying designed prompt templates to large language models,
we establish in-context learning and leverage prompt tuning technology to
improve the accuracy of determining whether claims have fact-check-worthiness,
particularly when dealing with limited or unlabeled data. Through extensive
experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
surpasses or matches multiple baseline methods in the classification task of
fact-check-worthiness estimation assessment, including classical pre-trained
models such as BERT, as well as recent popular large models like GPT-3.5 and
GPT-4. Experiments show that the prompt tuning-based method proposed in this
study exhibits certain advantages in evaluation metrics such as F1 score and
accuracy, thereby effectively validating its effectiveness and advancement in
the task of fact-check-worthiness estimation.

Motivation: 研究中英文媒体在报道巴黎奥运会时的异同，以揭示不同文化背景下的媒体话语特点和态度倾向。

Method: 采用主题建模、大语言模型（LLM）提示工程和语料库短语学方法进行分析。

Result: 中文媒体关注特定运动、体育精神、兴奋剂争议和新技术，英文媒体则聚焦女性运动员、奖牌获得和资格争议。中文报道在开幕式和体育精神描述中表现出更多介词共现和积极语义韵，英文报道在女性运动员报道中呈现积极语义韵，但在开幕式反应预测和女子拳击争议中表现出消极语义韵。

Conclusion: 中英文媒体在报道巴黎奥运会时存在显著差异，反映了不同文化背景下的媒体话语特点和态度倾向。

Abstract: This study analyzes Chinese and English media reports on the Paris Olympics
using topic modeling, Large Language Model (LLM) prompt engineering, and corpus
phraseology methods to explore similarities and differences in discourse
construction and attitudinal meanings. Common topics include the opening
ceremony, athlete performance, and sponsorship brands. Chinese media focus on
specific sports, sports spirit, doping controversies, and new technologies,
while English media focus on female athletes, medal wins, and eligibility
controversies. Chinese reports show more frequent prepositional co-occurrences
and positive semantic prosody in describing the opening ceremony and sports
spirit. English reports exhibit positive semantic prosody when covering female
athletes but negative prosody in predicting opening ceremony reactions and
discussing women's boxing controversies.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文通过大规模实证评估揭示了当前幻觉检测指标的不足，发现LLM（如GPT-4）评估效果最佳，并提出需要更鲁棒的指标和缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型的幻觉问题阻碍其可靠性和广泛应用，但现有指标在鲁棒性和泛化性上未经验证。

Method: 对6组幻觉检测指标、4个数据集、37个语言模型和5种解码方法进行大规模评估。

Result: 现有指标与人类判断不一致，LLM（如GPT-4）评估效果最佳，模式寻求解码方法可减少幻觉。

Conclusion: 需开发更鲁棒的幻觉评估指标和缓解策略。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant obstacle to the reliability and widespread
adoption of language models, yet their accurate measurement remains a
persistent challenge. While many task- and domain-specific metrics have been
proposed to assess faithfulness and factuality concerns, the robustness and
generalization of these metrics are still untested. In this paper, we conduct a
large-scale empirical evaluation of 6 diverse sets of hallucination detection
metrics across 4 datasets, 37 language models from 5 families, and 5 decoding
methods. Our extensive investigation reveals concerning gaps in current
hallucination evaluation: metrics often fail to align with human judgments,
take an overtly myopic view of the problem, and show inconsistent gains with
parameter scaling. Encouragingly, LLM-based evaluation, particularly with
GPT-4, yields the best overall results, and mode-seeking decoding methods seem
to reduce hallucinations, especially in knowledge-grounded settings. These
findings underscore the need for more robust metrics to understand and quantify
hallucinations, and better strategies to mitigate them.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的临床语言模型预训练目标，通过时间顺序的句子对训练模型，提升其在临床推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将电子健康记录视为静态文档，忽略了其时间演化和因果关联的特性。

Method: 提出时间蕴含预训练目标，将EHR片段作为时间顺序的句子对，训练模型判断后续状态是否蕴含、矛盾或中立。

Result: 在MIMIC IV数据集上预训练，模型在时间临床QA、早期预警预测和疾病进展建模中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 时间结构化的预训练任务能提升模型在临床推理任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Clinical language models have achieved strong performance on downstream tasks
by pretraining on domain specific corpora such as discharge summaries and
medical notes. However, most approaches treat the electronic health record as a
static document, neglecting the temporally-evolving and causally entwined
nature of patient trajectories. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal
entailment pretraining objective for language models in the clinical domain.
Our method formulates EHR segments as temporally ordered sentence pairs and
trains the model to determine whether a later state is entailed by,
contradictory to, or neutral with respect to an earlier state. Through this
temporally structured pretraining task, models learn to perform latent clinical
reasoning over time, improving their ability to generalize across forecasting
and diagnosis tasks. We pretrain on a large corpus derived from MIMIC IV and
demonstrate state of the art results on temporal clinical QA, early warning
prediction, and disease progression modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语在教育领域的NER研究缺乏标注数据集，限制了模型对学术角色、课程名称等实体的识别能力。

Method: 创建了包含13个教育领域实体的手动标注数据集EDU-NER-2025，并详细描述了标注过程及语言挑战。

Result: 成功构建了首个乌尔都语教育领域NER数据集，并分析了乌尔都语的形态复杂性和歧义性问题。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了乌尔都语教育领域NER数据集的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) plays a pivotal role in various Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks by identifying and classifying named entities
(NEs) from unstructured data into predefined categories such as person,
organization, location, date, and time. While extensive research exists for
high-resource languages and general domains, NER in Urdu particularly within
domain-specific contexts like education remains significantly underexplored.
This is Due to lack of annotated datasets for educational content which limits
the ability of existing models to accurately identify entities such as academic
roles, course names, and institutional terms, underscoring the urgent need for
targeted resources in this domain. To the best of our knowledge, no dataset
exists in the domain of the Urdu language for this purpose. To achieve this
objective this study makes three key contributions. Firstly, we created a
manually annotated dataset in the education domain, named EDU-NER-2025, which
contains 13 unique most important entities related to education domain. Second,
we describe our annotation process and guidelines in detail and discuss the
challenges of labelling EDU-NER-2025 dataset. Third, we addressed and analyzed
key linguistic challenges, such as morphological complexity and ambiguity,
which are prevalent in formal Urdu texts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律领域语言模型的应用潜力大，但法律文本的专业性和复杂性带来了挑战，需探索更有效的训练方法。

Method: 比较了基于偏好训练（RLHF和DPO）和传统监督学习的模型在生成冰岛法律摘要时的表现。

Result: 偏好训练提高了法律准确性，但对冰岛语言质量的提升不明显，自动化指标与人工评估存在差异。

Conclusion: 偏好训练在法律领域有潜力，但需结合定性评估以优化模型表现。

Abstract: The integration of language models in the legal domain holds considerable
promise for streamlining processes and improving efficiency in managing
extensive workloads. However, the specialized terminology, nuanced language,
and formal style of legal texts can present substantial challenges. This study
examines whether preference-based training techniques, specifically
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization,
can enhance models' performance in generating Icelandic legal summaries that
align with domain-specific language standards and user preferences. We compare
models fine-tuned with preference training to those using conventional
supervised learning. Results indicate that preference training improves the
legal accuracy of generated summaries over standard fine-tuning but does not
significantly enhance the overall quality of Icelandic language usage.
Discrepancies between automated metrics and human evaluations further
underscore the importance of qualitative assessment in developing language
models for the legal domain.

Motivation: 开发小型但高效的推理模型，支持多语言和引用功能，适用于资源受限的基础设施。

Method: 通过大型合成数据集进行预训练，支持RAG工作流功能（如查询路由、重排等）。

Result: 在标准化RAG基准测试中表现优异，支持多语言且引用准确。

Conclusion: 这些模型因其尺寸和高效性，为生成式AI开辟了新应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce a new generation of small reasoning models for RAG, search, and
source summarization. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B are mid-trained on a
large synthetic dataset emulating the retrieval of a wide variety of
multilingual open sources from the Common Corpus. They provide native support
for citation and grounding with literal quotes and reintegrate multiple
features associated with RAG workflows, such as query routing, query
reformulation, and source reranking. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B
outperform SLMs below 4 billion parameters on standardized RAG benchmarks
(HotPotQA, 2wiki) and are competitive with popular larger models, including
Qwen-2.5-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Gemma-3-4B. They are the only SLMs to date
maintaining consistent RAG performance across leading European languages and
ensuring systematic reference grounding for statements. Due to their size and
ease of deployment on constrained infrastructure and higher factuality by
design, the models unlock a range of new use cases for generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮推理数据集中，LLMs生成的推理令牌被排除在后续输入之外，导致无法单次前向处理整个对话，影响训练效率。

Method: 采用响应令牌复制和自定义注意力掩码，强制适当的可见性约束。

Result: 显著减少训练时间，实现多轮推理数据集的高效微调。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了多轮推理数据集中的训练效率问题。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models ( LLMs) to generate explicit reasoning before
they produce an answer has been shown to improve their performance across
various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, fine-tuning LLMs on
multi-turn reasoning datasets presents a unique challenge: LLMs must generate
reasoning tokens that are excluded from subsequent inputs to the LLM. This
discrepancy prevents us from processing an entire conversation in a single
forward pass-an optimization readily available when we fine-tune on a
multi-turn non-reasoning dataset. This paper proposes a novel approach that
overcomes this limitation through response token duplication and a custom
attention mask that enforces appropriate visibility constraints. Our approach
significantly reduces the training time and allows efficient fine-tuning on
multi-turn reasoning datasets.

Motivation: 自动化结构化临床访谈可提升心理健康服务可及性，但现有大语言模型方法未能符合精神病学诊断协议。

Method: MAGI通过四个专门智能体（导航、提问、判断和诊断）动态执行MINI的临床逻辑，生成可解释的PsyCoT追踪。

Result: 在1002名真实参与者中测试，覆盖抑郁、焦虑和自杀倾向，MAGI显著提升了评估效果。

Conclusion: MAGI为LLM辅助心理健康评估提供了临床严谨、适应性强且可解释的新方法。

Abstract: Automating structured clinical interviews could revolutionize mental
healthcare accessibility, yet existing large language models (LLMs) approaches
fail to align with psychiatric diagnostic protocols. We present MAGI, the first
framework that transforms the gold-standard Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview (MINI) into automatic computational workflows through coordinated
multi-agent collaboration. MAGI dynamically navigates clinical logic via four
specialized agents: 1) an interview tree guided navigation agent adhering to
the MINI's branching structure, 2) an adaptive question agent blending
diagnostic probing, explaining, and empathy, 3) a judgment agent validating
whether the response from participants meet the node, and 4) a diagnosis Agent
generating Psychometric Chain-of- Thought (PsyCoT) traces that explicitly map
symptoms to clinical criteria. Experimental results on 1,002 real-world
participants covering depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety and
suicide shows that MAGI advances LLM- assisted mental health assessment by
combining clinical rigor, conversational adaptability, and explainable
reasoning.

Motivation: 解决图像生成模型中实体知识记忆不足的问题，因实体数量庞大且持续涌现。

Method: 提出TextTIGER方法，利用LLM增强和总结实体描述，减少长输入的性能下降。

Result: 在IS、FID和CLIPScore等指标上表现优于仅使用标题提示的方法，且总结的描述更丰富。

Conclusion: 通过增强和总结实体描述可显著提升图像生成能力。

Abstract: Generating images from prompts containing specific entities requires models
to retain as much entity-specific knowledge as possible. However, fully
memorizing such knowledge is impractical due to the vast number of entities and
their continuous emergence. To address this, we propose Text-based Intelligent
Generation with Entity prompt Refinement (TextTIGER), which augments knowledge
on entities included in the prompts and then summarizes the augmented
descriptions using Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate performance
degradation from longer inputs. To evaluate our method, we introduce WiT-Cub
(WiT with Captions and Uncomplicated Background-explanations), a dataset
comprising captions, images, and an entity list. Experiments on four image
generation models and five LLMs show that TextTIGER improves image generation
performance in standard metrics (IS, FID, and CLIPScore) compared to
caption-only prompts. Additionally, multiple annotators' evaluation confirms
that the summarized descriptions are more informative, validating LLMs' ability
to generate concise yet rich descriptions. These findings demonstrate that
refining prompts with augmented and summarized entity-related descriptions
enhances image generation capabilities. The code and dataset will be available
upon acceptance.

Motivation: LLMs的幻觉问题（输出错误信息）是主要挑战之一，但缺乏对其不确定性评估和校准方法的深入分析和比较。

Method: 通过系统综述代表性文献，并引入一个严格的基准测试，使用两个广泛使用的可靠性数据集对六种相关方法进行实证评估。

Result: 实证评估验证了综述的重要发现，并展示了现有方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面综述了LLMs的校准方法和相关指标，并提出了未来研究方向和开放挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been transformative across many domains.
However, hallucination -- confidently outputting incorrect information --
remains one of the leading challenges for LLMs. This raises the question of how
to accurately assess and quantify the uncertainty of LLMs. Extensive literature
on traditional models has explored Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to measure
uncertainty and employed calibration techniques to address the misalignment
between uncertainty and accuracy. While some of these methods have been adapted
for LLMs, the literature lacks an in-depth analysis of their effectiveness and
does not offer a comprehensive benchmark to enable insightful comparison among
existing solutions. In this work, we fill this gap via a systematic survey of
representative prior works on UQ and calibration for LLMs and introduce a
rigorous benchmark. Using two widely used reliability datasets, we empirically
evaluate six related methods, which justify the significant findings of our
review. Finally, we provide outlooks for key future directions and outline open
challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first dedicated
study to review the calibration methods and relevant metrics for LLMs.

absence of benchmark datasets specifically tailored to evaluate their

-- initially developed for natural language understanding tasks -- by
relabeling the data and integrating simulated servers and external services.
This enhancement enables a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation pipeline,
covering language understanding, task execution, and response generation. Our
experiments demonstrate that Auto-SLURP presents a significant challenge for
current state-of-the-art frameworks, highlighting that truly reliable and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NLI系统依赖监督学习，数据中存在偏差和局限性，限制了泛化能力和实际应用。

Method: 采用GRPO强化学习方法结合Chain-of-Thought学习，使用LoRA和QLoRA参数高效技术微调7B、14B和32B模型。

Result: 32B量化模型在11个对抗性测试集中7个表现最优，内存占用仅22GB，证明了量化下仍能保持鲁棒推理。

Conclusion: 该工作为构建无需牺牲推理质量的鲁棒NLI系统提供了可扩展且实用的框架。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a central task in natural language
understanding with applications in fact-checking, question answering, and
information retrieval. Despite its importance, current NLI systems heavily rely
on supervised learning with datasets that often contain annotation artifacts
and biases, limiting generalization and real-world applicability. In this work,
we apply a reinforcement learning-based approach using Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning in NLI, eliminating the
need for labeled rationales and enabling this type of training on more
challenging datasets such as ANLI. We fine-tune 7B, 14B, and 32B language
models using parameter-efficient techniques (LoRA and QLoRA), demonstrating
strong performance across standard and adversarial NLI benchmarks. Our 32B
AWQ-quantized model surpasses state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 11
adversarial sets$\unicode{x2013}$or on all of them considering our
replication$\unicode{x2013}$within a 22GB memory footprint, showing that robust
reasoning can be retained under aggressive quantization. This work provides a
scalable and practical framework for building robust NLI systems without
sacrificing inference quality.

Motivation: Bohairic Coptic作为拜占庭晚期埃及的主要方言和当代科普特教会的语言，缺乏数字资源，研究不足。

Method: 构建并评估了Bohairic Coptic的语法标注语料库，包括圣经文本、圣徒传记等，并与Sahidic Coptic进行对比分析。

Result: 通过跨方言解析实验，发现Bohairic Coptic与Sahidic Coptic虽相关但具有独特性。

Conclusion: Bohairic Coptic作为一种独特方言，需要更多资源与研究支持。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in digital resources for other Coptic dialects,
especially Sahidic, Bohairic Coptic, the main Coptic dialect for pre-Mamluk,
late Byzantine Egypt, and the contemporary language of the Coptic Church,
remains critically under-resourced. This paper presents and evaluates the first
syntactically annotated corpus of Bohairic Coptic, sampling data from a range
of works, including Biblical text, saints' lives and Christian ascetic writing.
We also explore some of the main differences we observe compared to the
existing UD treebank of Sahidic Coptic, the classical dialect of the language,
and conduct joint and cross-dialect parsing experiments, revealing the unique
nature of Bohairic as a related, but distinct variety from the more often
studied Sahidic.

TLDR: HRScene是一个用于评估视觉大语言模型（VLMs）在高分辨率图像（HRI）理解能力的统一基准，包含25个真实数据集和2个合成数据集。实验显示当前VLMs在HRI任务上的平均准确率约为50%，存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs声称能处理高分辨率图像，但缺乏全面的评估基准，因此提出HRScene填补这一空白。

Method: HRScene整合了25个真实场景数据集和2个合成诊断数据集，覆盖多种场景和分辨率，由10名研究生重新标注。实验评估了28种VLMs的性能。

Result: 当前VLMs在真实任务中平均准确率为50%，合成数据集显示模型难以有效利用HRI区域，存在区域发散和中间信息丢失问题。

Conclusion: HRScene揭示了VLMs在高分辨率图像理解上的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: High-resolution image (HRI) understanding aims to process images with a large
number of pixels, such as pathological images and agricultural aerial images,
both of which can exceed 1 million pixels. Vision Large Language Models (VLMs)
can allegedly handle HRIs, however, there is a lack of a comprehensive
benchmark for VLMs to evaluate HRI understanding. To address this gap, we
introduce HRScene, a novel unified benchmark for HRI understanding with rich
scenes. HRScene incorporates 25 real-world datasets and 2 synthetic diagnostic
datasets with resolutions ranging from 1,024 $\times$ 1,024 to 35,503 $\times$
26,627. HRScene is collected and re-annotated by 10 graduate-level annotators,
covering 25 scenarios, ranging from microscopic to radiology images, street
views, long-range pictures, and telescope images. It includes HRIs of
real-world objects, scanned documents, and composite multi-image. The two
diagnostic evaluation datasets are synthesized by combining the target image
with the gold answer and distracting images in different orders, assessing how
well models utilize regions in HRI. We conduct extensive experiments involving
28 VLMs, including Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o. Experiments on HRScene show
that current VLMs achieve an average accuracy of around 50% on real-world
tasks, revealing significant gaps in HRI understanding. Results on synthetic
datasets reveal that VLMs struggle to effectively utilize HRI regions, showing
significant Regional Divergence and lost-in-middle, shedding light on future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM替代心理治疗师的可行性，因科技初创企业和研究领域对此有推广。

Method: 通过映射主流医疗机构使用的治疗指南，评估LLM在治疗关系中的表现，并进行实验测试LLM（如GPT-4）的回应。

Result: LLM表现出对心理健康问题的偏见，并在自然治疗环境中不恰当地回应关键情况（如鼓励妄想思维），且现有安全措施无法解决这些问题。

Conclusion: LLM不应替代治疗师，但可探讨其在临床治疗中的其他辅助角色。

Abstract: Should a large language model (LLM) be used as a therapist? In this paper, we
investigate the use of LLMs to *replace* mental health providers, a use case
promoted in the tech startup and research space. We conduct a mapping review of
therapy guides used by major medical institutions to identify crucial aspects
of therapeutic relationships, such as the importance of a therapeutic alliance
between therapist and client. We then assess the ability of LLMs to reproduce
and adhere to these aspects of therapeutic relationships by conducting several
experiments investigating the responses of current LLMs, such as `gpt-4o`.
Contrary to best practices in the medical community, LLMs 1) express stigma
toward those with mental health conditions and 2) respond inappropriately to
certain common (and critical) conditions in naturalistic therapy settings --
e.g., LLMs encourage clients' delusional thinking, likely due to their
sycophancy. This occurs even with larger and newer LLMs, indicating that
current safety practices may not address these gaps. Furthermore, we note
foundational and practical barriers to the adoption of LLMs as therapists, such
as that a therapeutic alliance requires human characteristics (e.g., identity
and stakes). For these reasons, we conclude that LLMs should not replace
therapists, and we discuss alternative roles for LLMs in clinical therapy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 1-bit LLMs的部署因激活异常值而受限，难以实现低比特量化。

Method: 提出H-BitLinear模块，应用在线Hadamard变换平滑激活分布，使其适合低比特表示。

Result: BitNet v2在8-bit激活下性能与BitNet b1.58相当，4-bit激活下性能损失极小。

Conclusion: BitNet v2显著降低了内存和计算成本，适用于批量推理。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by
activation outliers, which complicate quantization to low bit-widths. We
introduce BitNet v2, a novel framework enabling native 4-bit activation
quantization for 1-bit LLMs. To tackle outliers in attention and feed-forward
network activations, we propose H-BitLinear, a module applying an online
Hadamard transformation prior to activation quantization. This transformation
smooths sharp activation distributions into more Gaussian-like forms, suitable
for low-bit representation. Experiments show BitNet v2 trained from scratch
with 8-bit activations matches BitNet b1.58 performance. Crucially, BitNet v2
achieves minimal performance degradation when trained with native 4-bit
activations, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational cost for
batched inference.

Motivation: 为多语言数学推理提供一个全面、高质量的基准，以评估和提升LLMs在多语言环境下的推理能力。

Method: 开发PolyMath基准，涵盖18种语言和4种难度级别，对高级LLMs进行综合评估。

Result: Deepseek-R1-671B和Qwen-QwQ-32B的得分仅为43.4和41.8，最高难度下准确率低于30%。研究揭示了LLMs在多语言推理中的性能差异、输入输出语言一致性低等问题。

Conclusion: 控制输出语言可能影响推理性能，尤其是低资源语言，为提升LLMs多语言能力提供了方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PolyMath, a multilingual mathematical reasoning
benchmark covering 18 languages and 4 easy-to-hard difficulty levels. Our
benchmark ensures difficulty comprehensiveness, language diversity, and
high-quality translation, making it a highly discriminative multilingual
mathematical benchmark in the era of reasoning LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation for advanced LLMs and find that even Deepseek-R1-671B and
Qwen-QwQ-32B, achieve only 43.4 and 41.8 benchmark scores, with less than 30%
accuracy under the highest level. From a language perspective, our benchmark
reveals several key challenges of LLMs in multilingual reasoning: (1) Reasoning
performance varies widely across languages for current LLMs; (2) Input-output
language consistency is low in reasoning LLMs and may be correlated with
performance; (3) The thinking length differs significantly by language for
current LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate that controlling the output language
in the instructions has the potential to affect reasoning performance,
especially for some low-resource languages, suggesting a promising direction
for improving multilingual capabilities in LLMs.

Method: 提出FAST框架，包含问题特征建模、自适应推理奖励机制和难度感知KL正则化三部分。

Result: 在七个推理基准测试中，FAST相比基线模型提升10%准确率，同时减少32.7-67.3%的token使用。

Conclusion: FAST有效平衡推理长度与准确性，为大型视觉语言模型的高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have revealed an
\textit{overthinking} phenomenon, where models generate verbose reasoning
across all tasks regardless of questions. To address this issue, we present
\textbf{FAST}, a novel \textbf{Fa}st-\textbf{S}low \textbf{T}hinking framework
that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question characteristics.
Through empirical analysis, we establish the feasibility of fast-slow thinking
in LVLMs by investigating how response length and data distribution affect
performance. We develop FAST-GRPO with three components: model-based metrics
for question characterization, an adaptive thinking reward mechanism, and
difficulty-aware KL regularization. Experiments across seven reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that FAST achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with over
10\% relative improvement compared to the base model, while reducing token
usage by 32.7-67.3\% compared to previous slow-thinking approaches, effectively
balancing reasoning length and accuracy.

Result: 提出了一种新的SoTA方法，解决了数据泄漏和评估指标问题，提升了对话理解和系统开发的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为SSI研究提供了新基础，推动了对话理解和系统开发的进展。

Abstract: In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, Slot Schema Induction (SSI) is
essential for automatically identifying key information slots from dialogue
data without manual intervention. This paper presents a novel state-of-the-art
(SoTA) approach that formulates SSI as a text generation task, where a language
model incrementally constructs and refines a slot schema over a stream of
dialogue data. To develop this approach, we present a fully automatic LLM-based
TOD simulation method that creates data with high-quality state labels for
novel task domains. Furthermore, we identify issues in SSI evaluation due to
data leakage and poor metric alignment with human judgment. We resolve these by
creating new evaluation data using our simulation method with human guidance
and correction, as well as designing improved evaluation metrics. These
contributions establish a foundation for future SSI research and advance the
SoTA in dialogue understanding and system development.

Result: LLMs表现出部分共同建构行为（如验证问题），能提升理解，但监控和调整解释的能力有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在共同建构性解释对话中有潜力，但需进一步提升动态适应能力。

Abstract: The ability to generate explanations that are understood by explainees is the
quintessence of explainable artificial intelligence. Since understanding
depends on the explainee's background and needs, recent research has focused on
co-constructive explanation dialogues, where the explainer continuously
monitors the explainee's understanding and adapts explanations dynamically. We
investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage as explainers
in co-constructive explanation dialogues. In particular, we present a user
study in which explainees interact with LLMs, of which some have been
instructed to explain a predefined topic co-constructively. We evaluate the
explainees' understanding before and after the dialogue, as well as their
perception of the LLMs' co-constructive behavior. Our results indicate that
current LLMs show some co-constructive behaviors, such as asking verification
questions, that foster the explainees' engagement and can improve understanding
of a topic. However, their ability to effectively monitor the current
understanding and scaffold the explanations accordingly remains limited.

*Gwen Yidou Weng,Benjie Wang,Guy Van den Broeck*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: TRACE是一种新框架，通过概率推理和轻量控制高效计算预期属性概率（EAP），实现语言模型的全局可控生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在控制语言模型输出时成本高、灵活性差，或计算EAP时效率低、不可靠。

Method: TRACE通过从语言模型中提取隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）并结合小型分类器，精确计算EAP并调整下一个词的概率。

Result: TRACE在解毒任务中表现最优，仅增加10%的解码开销，并能快速适配76个低资源个性化模型。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种高效、灵活的方法，适用于多种属性控制任务。

Abstract: As large language models (LMs) advance, there is an increasing need to
control their outputs to align with human values (e.g., detoxification) or
desired attributes (e.g., personalization, topic). However, autoregressive
models focus on next-token predictions and struggle with global properties that
require looking ahead. Existing solutions either tune or post-train LMs for
each new attribute - expensive and inflexible - or approximate the Expected
Attribute Probability (EAP) of future sequences by sampling or training, which
is slow and unreliable for rare attributes. We introduce TRACE (Tractable
Probabilistic Reasoning for Adaptable Controllable gEneration), a novel
framework that efficiently computes EAP and adapts to new attributes through
tractable probabilistic reasoning and lightweight control. TRACE distills a
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from an LM and pairs it with a small classifier to
estimate attribute probabilities, enabling exact EAP computation over the HMM's
predicted futures. This EAP is then used to reweigh the LM's next-token
probabilities for globally compliant continuations. Empirically, TRACE achieves
state-of-the-art results in detoxification with only 10% decoding overhead,
adapts to 76 low-resource personalized LLMs within seconds, and seamlessly
extends to composite attributes.

### [33] [Spectral Dictionary Learning for Generative Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17804)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于频谱生成的新型图像合成模型，通过确定性字典学习和频域损失函数实现高效且可解释的图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型（如变分、对抗和扩散模型）依赖随机推理或对抗训练，缺乏可解释性。本文旨在通过频谱表示提供更直观、物理意义明确的生成方法。

Method: 将图像展平为一维信号，用学习的频谱基函数（参数化为频率、相位和振幅）线性组合重建。通过确定性字典学习和频域损失函数（STFT）优化模型。

Result: 在CIFAR-10基准测试中，模型在重建质量和感知保真度上表现优异，同时训练稳定性和计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 该模型为可控合成提供了新途径，频谱字典的直接操作增强了可解释性，适用于图像处理和分析的新应用。

Abstract: We propose a novel spectral generative model for image synthesis that departs
radically from the common variational, adversarial, and diffusion paradigms. In
our approach, images, after being flattened into one-dimensional signals, are
reconstructed as linear combinations of a set of learned spectral basis
functions, where each basis is explicitly parameterized in terms of frequency,
phase, and amplitude. The model jointly learns a global spectral dictionary
with time-varying modulations and per-image mixing coefficients that quantify
the contributions of each spectral component. Subsequently, a simple
probabilistic model is fitted to these mixing coefficients, enabling the
deterministic generation of new images by sampling from the latent space. This
framework leverages deterministic dictionary learning, offering a highly
interpretable and physically meaningful representation compared to methods
relying on stochastic inference or adversarial training. Moreover, the
incorporation of frequency-domain loss functions, computed via the short-time
Fourier transform (STFT), ensures that the synthesized images capture both
global structure and fine-grained spectral details, such as texture and edge
information. Experimental evaluations on the CIFAR-10 benchmark demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves competitive performance in terms of
reconstruction quality and perceptual fidelity but also offers improved
training stability and computational efficiency. This new type of generative
model opens up promising avenues for controlled synthesis, as the learned
spectral dictionary affords a direct handle on the intrinsic frequency content
of the images, thus providing enhanced interpretability and potential for novel
applications in image manipulation and analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: SmallGS是一种针对小基线视频设计的相机姿态估计框架，利用高斯泼溅优化相机姿态，结合预训练视觉特征提升鲁棒性，在动态场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小基线运动视频在社交媒体中常见，但现有姿态估计框架因特征模糊、漂移累积和三角约束不足而难以处理。

Method: SmallGS通过高斯泼溅重建场景，并利用预训练特征（如DINOv2）增强姿态估计的鲁棒性，无需显式特征对应或强视差运动。

Result: 在TUM-Dynamics序列中，SmallGS在小基线视频的相机姿态估计上优于MonST3R和DORID-SLAM。

Conclusion: SmallGS为小基线视频提供了一种高效、鲁棒的相机姿态估计解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic videos with small baseline motions are ubiquitous in daily life,
especially on social media. However, these videos present a challenge to
existing pose estimation frameworks due to ambiguous features, drift
accumulation, and insufficient triangulation constraints. Gaussian splatting,
which maintains an explicit representation for scenes, provides a reliable
novel view rasterization when the viewpoint change is small. Inspired by this,
we propose SmallGS, a camera pose estimation framework that is specifically
designed for small-baseline videos. SmallGS optimizes sequential camera poses
using Gaussian splatting, which reconstructs the scene from the first frame in
each video segment to provide a stable reference for the rest. The temporal
consistency of Gaussian splatting within limited viewpoint differences reduced
the requirement of sufficient depth variations in traditional camera pose
estimation. We further incorporate pretrained robust visual features, e.g.
DINOv2, into Gaussian splatting, where high-dimensional feature map rendering
enhances the robustness of camera pose estimation. By freezing the Gaussian
splatting and optimizing camera viewpoints based on rasterized features,
SmallGS effectively learns camera poses without requiring explicit feature
correspondences or strong parallax motion. We verify the effectiveness of
SmallGS in small-baseline videos in TUM-Dynamics sequences, which achieves
impressive accuracy in camera pose estimation compared to MonST3R and
DORID-SLAM for small-baseline videos in dynamic scenes. Our project page is at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究无监督目标分割方法，解决2D和3D场景中目标与背景的区分问题，并探索无监督方法在计算机视觉中的潜力。

Method: FlowCapsules利用运动作为2D场景中目标的线索；3D应用中利用几何一致性检测动态目标，并通过优化内核改进3D建模。

Result: 提出了无监督目标分割方法，展示了在2D和3D场景中的有效性，并改进了3D建模。

Conclusion: 无监督目标分割方法在计算机视觉中具有潜力，未来可探索更多无监督定义目标的方向。

Abstract: In this thesis we discuss architectural designs and training methods for a
neural network to have the ability of dissecting an image into objects of
interest without supervision. The main challenge in 2D unsupervised object
segmentation is distinguishing between foreground objects of interest and
background. FlowCapsules uses motion as a cue for the objects of interest in 2D
scenarios. The last part of this thesis focuses on 3D applications where the
goal is detecting and removal of the object of interest from the input images.
In these tasks, we leverage the geometric consistency of scenes in 3D to detect
the inconsistent dynamic objects. Our transient object masks are then used for
designing robust optimization kernels to improve 3D modelling in a casual
capture setup. One of our goals in this thesis is to show the merits of
unsupervised object based approaches in computer vision. Furthermore, we
suggest possible directions for defining objects of interest or foreground
objects without requiring supervision. Our hope is to motivate and excite the
community into further exploring explicit object representations in image
understanding tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: CLOC是一种新的基于边际的对比学习方法，用于序数分类，通过优化多边际损失（MMNP）学习有序表示，解决了现有方法未考虑不同类别间边际重要性差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在序数分类中，邻近类别的错误分类后果不同，但现有方法未考虑这种差异。例如，良性肿瘤分类错误的影响远小于癌前到癌症分类错误的影响。

Method: 提出CLOC方法，使用多边际n对损失（MMNP）学习有序表示，支持灵活决策边界，减少对训练数据偏见的过拟合。

Result: 在五个真实图像数据集和一个合成数据集上，CLOC优于现有序数分类方法，展示了其可解释性和可控性。

Conclusion: CLOC通过学习与临床需求一致的有序表示，提升了序数分类的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: In ordinal classification, misclassifying neighboring ranks is common, yet
the consequences of these errors are not the same. For example, misclassifying
benign tumor categories is less consequential, compared to an error at the
pre-cancerous to cancerous threshold, which could profoundly influence
treatment choices. Despite this, existing ordinal classification methods do not
account for the varying importance of these margins, treating all neighboring
classes as equally significant. To address this limitation, we propose CLOC, a
new margin-based contrastive learning method for ordinal classification that
learns an ordered representation based on the optimization of multiple margins
with a novel multi-margin n-pair loss (MMNP). CLOC enables flexible decision
boundaries across key adjacent categories, facilitating smooth transitions
between classes and reducing the risk of overfitting to biases present in the
training data. We provide empirical discussion regarding the properties of MMNP
and show experimental results on five real-world image datasets (Adience,
Historical Colour Image Dating, Knee Osteoarthritis, Indian Diabetic
Retinopathy Image, and Breast Carcinoma Subtyping) and one synthetic dataset
simulating clinical decision bias. Our results demonstrate that CLOC
outperforms existing ordinal classification methods and show the
interpretability and controllability of CLOC in learning meaningful, ordered
representations that align with clinical and practical needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D修复中如何有效利用多视角互补视觉和语义信息的挑战。

Method: 提出VISTA框架，结合可见性不确定性引导的3DGI和场景概念学习，并使用扩散模型填充掩蔽对象。

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF和UTB180数据集上表现优于现有技术，支持动态干扰物处理。

Conclusion: VISTA框架在3D修复中表现出色，适用于多样化的场景重建任务。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful and efficient 3D
representation for novel view synthesis. This paper extends 3DGS capabilities
to inpainting, where masked objects in a scene are replaced with new contents
that blend seamlessly with the surroundings. Unlike 2D image inpainting, 3D
Gaussian inpainting (3DGI) is challenging in effectively leveraging
complementary visual and semantic cues from multiple input views, as occluded
areas in one view may be visible in others. To address this, we propose a
method that measures the visibility uncertainties of 3D points across different
input views and uses them to guide 3DGI in utilizing complementary visual cues.
We also employ uncertainties to learn a semantic concept of scene without the
masked object and use a diffusion model to fill masked objects in input images
based on the learned concept. Finally, we build a novel 3DGI framework, VISTA,
by integrating VISibility-uncerTainty-guided 3DGI with scene conceptuAl
learning. VISTA generates high-quality 3DGS models capable of synthesizing
artifact-free and naturally inpainted novel views. Furthermore, our approach
extends to handling dynamic distractors arising from temporal object changes,
enhancing its versatility in diverse scene reconstruction scenarios. We
demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art
techniques using two challenging datasets: the SPIn-NeRF dataset, featuring 10
diverse static 3D inpainting scenes, and an underwater 3D inpainting dataset
derived from UTB180, including fast-moving fish as inpainting targets.

TLDR: 提出了一种零样本训练主题驱动的定制视频生成模型，通过分离主题学习和时间动态，无需额外调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无调优视频定制方法依赖大型标注视频数据集，计算成本高且需大量标注。本文旨在利用图像定制数据集直接训练视频模型，降低成本并提高效率。

Method: 将视频定制分解为两步：(1)通过图像定制数据集注入主题；(2)通过图像到视频训练方法保留时间动态。采用随机图像标记丢弃和随机初始化以解决复制粘贴问题，并通过随机切换优化主题和时间特征。

Result: 模型在零样本设置下表现出色，主题一致性和可扩展性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了视频定制中的计算和标注问题，展示了其高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: We propose to train a subject-driven customized video generation model
through decoupling the subject-specific learning from temporal dynamics in
zero-shot without additional tuning. A traditional method for video
customization that is tuning-free often relies on large, annotated video
datasets, which are computationally expensive and require extensive annotation.
In contrast to the previous approach, we introduce the use of an image
customization dataset directly on training video customization models,
factorizing the video customization into two folds: (1) identity injection
through image customization dataset and (2) temporal modeling preservation with
a small set of unannotated videos through the image-to-video training method.
Additionally, we employ random image token dropping with randomized image
initialization during image-to-video fine-tuning to mitigate the copy-and-paste
issue. To further enhance learning, we introduce stochastic switching during
joint optimization of subject-specific and temporal features, mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Our method achieves strong subject consistency and
scalability, outperforming existing video customization models in zero-shot
settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: When employing underwater vehicles for the autonomous inspection of assets,
it is crucial to consider and assess the water conditions. Indeed, they have a
significant impact on the visibility, which also affects robotic operations.
Turbidity can jeopardise the whole mission as it may prevent correct visual
documentation of the inspected structures. Previous works have introduced
methods to adapt to turbidity and backscattering, however, they also include
manoeuvring and setup constraints. We propose a simple yet efficient approach
to enable high-quality image acquisition of assets in a broad range of water
conditions. This active perception framework includes a multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) trained to predict image quality given a distance to a target and
artificial light intensity. We generated a large synthetic dataset including
ten water types with different levels of turbidity and backscattering. For
this, we modified the modelling software Blender to better account for the
underwater light propagation properties. We validated the approach in
simulation and showed significant improvements in visual coverage and quality
of imagery compared to traditional approaches. The project code is available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频评测基准多局限于单一语言（英语）和西方文化背景，无法全面评估AI系统的跨文化、跨语言理解能力。

Method: 构建包含中国、北美和欧洲文化的视频数据集，提供中英双语问题，涵盖数百个领域，包含1,389个视频和3,134个QA对，并对24个视频大模型进行评估。

Result: 现有模型在中文问题（尤其是中国历史相关）上表现较差；开源模型在时间理解任务（如事件定位）上表现有限（最高45.2%）；主流模型在科学问题上表现强，开源模型在数学上表现弱。

Conclusion: VideoVista-CulturalLingo揭示了当前视频理解模型在文化多样性、语言多样性和领域广度上的不足，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Assessing the video comprehension capabilities of multimodal AI systems can
effectively measure their understanding and reasoning abilities. Most video
evaluation benchmarks are limited to a single language, typically English, and
predominantly feature videos rooted in Western cultural contexts. In this
paper, we present VideoVista-CulturalLingo, the first video evaluation
benchmark designed to bridge cultural, linguistic, and domain divide in video
comprehension. Our work differs from existing benchmarks in the following ways:
1) Cultural diversity, incorporating cultures from China, North America, and
Europe; 2) Multi-linguistics, with questions presented in Chinese and
English-two of the most widely spoken languages; and 3) Broad domain, featuring
videos sourced from hundreds of human-created domains. VideoVista-CulturalLingo
contains 1,389 videos and 3,134 QA pairs, and we have evaluated 24 recent
open-source or proprietary video large models. From the experiment results, we
observe that: 1) Existing models perform worse on Chinese-centric questions
than Western-centric ones, particularly those related to Chinese history; 2)
Current open-source models still exhibit limitations in temporal understanding,
especially in the Event Localization task, achieving a maximum score of only
45.2%; 3) Mainstream models demonstrate strong performance in general
scientific questions, while open-source models demonstrate weak performance in
mathematics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RTS是北极地区重要的冻土退化标志，但其检测面临小尺度、模糊边界和时空变化的困难，需要更精确的映射方法。

Method: 采用Cascade Mask R-CNN结合多尺度视觉Transformer，提出两种新策略：特征级残差跨模态注意力融合和预训练单模态学习后多模态微调。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有模型，为多模态数据在RTS映射中的高效利用提供了新思路。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提升了RTS检测的准确性，还深化了对冻土地貌及其环境影响的理解。

Abstract: Retrogressive Thaw Slumps (RTS) in Arctic regions are distinct permafrost
landforms with significant environmental impacts. Mapping these RTS is crucial
because their appearance serves as a clear indication of permafrost thaw.
However, their small scale compared to other landform features, vague
boundaries, and spatiotemporal variation pose significant challenges for
accurate detection. In this paper, we employed a state-of-the-art deep learning
model, the Cascade Mask R-CNN with a multi-scale vision transformer-based
backbone, to delineate RTS features across the Arctic. Two new strategies were
introduced to optimize multimodal learning and enhance the model's predictive
performance: (1) a feature-level, residual cross-modality attention fusion
strategy, which effectively integrates feature maps from multiple modalities to
capture complementary information and improve the model's ability to understand
complex patterns and relationships within the data; (2) pre-trained unimodal
learning followed by multimodal fine-tuning to alleviate high computing demand
while achieving strong model performance. Experimental results demonstrated
that our approach outperformed existing models adopting data-level fusion,
feature-level convolutional fusion, and various attention fusion strategies,
providing valuable insights into the efficient utilization of multimodal data
for RTS mapping. This research contributes to our understanding of permafrost
landforms and their environmental implications.

Motivation: 现有方法（如U-Net和DiTs）在图像修复中仍有局限性，尤其是仅依赖文本描述无法充分捕捉视觉特征。DPIR旨在通过多视角提取条件信息，提升修复效果。

Method: DPIR包含两个分支：低质量图像条件分支（高效整合图像先验）和双提示控制分支（提供全局和局部视觉提示）。结合文本提示，形成双提示控制。

Result: 实验结果表明，DPIR在图像修复中表现优异。

Conclusion: DPIR通过双提示机制和多视角条件提取，显著提升了图像修复的质量和效果。

Abstract: Recent state-of-the-art image restoration methods mostly adopt latent
diffusion models with U-Net backbones, yet still facing challenges in achieving
high-quality restoration due to their limited capabilities. Diffusion
transformers (DiTs), like SD3, are emerging as a promising alternative because
of their better quality with scalability. In this paper, we introduce DPIR
(Dual Prompting Image Restoration), a novel image restoration method that
effectivly extracts conditional information of low-quality images from multiple
perspectives. Specifically, DPIR consits of two branches: a low-quality image
conditioning branch and a dual prompting control branch. The first branch
utilizes a lightweight module to incorporate image priors into the DiT with
high efficiency. More importantly, we believe that in image restoration,
textual description alone cannot fully capture its rich visual characteristics.
Therefore, a dual prompting module is designed to provide DiT with additional
visual cues, capturing both global context and local appearance. The extracted
global-local visual prompts as extra conditional control, alongside textual
prompts to form dual prompts, greatly enhance the quality of the restoration.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DPIR delivers superior image
restoration performance.

Abstract: Widely shared videos on the internet are often edited. Recently, although
Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) have made great progress in general
video understanding tasks, their capabilities in video editing understanding
(VEU) tasks remain unexplored. To address this gap, in this paper, we introduce
VEU-Bench (Video Editing Understanding Benchmark), a comprehensive benchmark
that categorizes video editing components across various dimensions, from
intra-frame features like shot size to inter-shot attributes such as cut types
and transitions. Unlike previous video editing understanding benchmarks that
focus mainly on editing element classification, VEU-Bench encompasses 19
fine-grained tasks across three stages: recognition, reasoning, and judging. To
enhance the annotation of VEU automatically, we built an annotation pipeline
integrated with an ontology-based knowledge base. Through extensive experiments
with 11 state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs, our findings reveal that current Vid-LLMs
face significant challenges in VEU tasks, with some performing worse than
random choice. To alleviate this issue, we develop Oscars, a VEU expert model
fine-tuned on the curated VEU-Bench dataset. It outperforms existing
open-source Vid-LLMs on VEU-Bench by over 28.3% in accuracy and achieves
performance comparable to commercial models like GPT-4o. We also demonstrate
that incorporating VEU data significantly enhances the performance of Vid-LLMs
on general video understanding benchmarks, with an average improvement of 8.3%
across nine reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 单图像去雾在遥感应用中很重要，但现有模型对对抗噪声的脆弱性尚未充分分析。

Abstract: Single-image dehazing is an important topic in remote sensing applications,
enhancing the quality of acquired images and increasing object detection
precision. However, the reliability of such structures has not been
sufficiently analyzed, which poses them to the risk of imperceptible
perturbations that can significantly hinder their performance. In this work, we
show that state-of-the-art image-to-image dehazing transformers are susceptible
to adversarial noise, with even 1 pixel change being able to decrease the PSNR
by as much as 2.8 dB. Next, we propose two lightweight fine-tuning strategies
aimed at increasing the robustness of pre-trained transformers. Our methods
results in comparable clean performance, while significantly increasing the
protection against adversarial data. We further present their applicability in
two remote sensing scenarios, showcasing their robust behavior for
out-of-distribution data. The source code for adversarial fine-tuning and
attack algorithms can be found at github.com/Vladimirescu/RobustDehazing.

Abstract: The exponential growth of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has driven
advancements in cross-modal reasoning but at significant computational costs.
In this work, we focus on visual language models. We highlight the redundancy
and inefficiency in current vision encoders, and seek to construct an adaptive
compression method for multimodal data. In this work, we characterize a panoply
of visual token selection and merging approaches through both benchmarking and
qualitative analysis. In particular, we demonstrate that simple cluster-level
token aggregation outperforms prior state-of-the-art works in token selection
and merging, including merging at the vision encoder level and attention-based
approaches. We underline the redundancy in current vision encoders, and shed
light on several puzzling trends regarding principles of visual token selection
through cross-modal attention visualizations. This work is a first effort
towards more effective encoding and processing of high-dimensional data, and
paves the way for more scalable and sustainable multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的进步使得通过文本提示轻松编辑图像成为可能，但也带来了图像安全问题。现有防御方法在像素空间添加噪声易被察觉且不鲁棒。

Method: 在频域中通过优化DCT系数引入对抗性扰动，利用JPEG流程生成对抗性图像。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在减少视觉伪影的同时，保持了编辑保护效果和对噪声净化技术的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 频域优化方法在保护图像安全和视觉质量方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion models have enabled effortless image editing via
text prompts, raising concerns about image security. Attackers with access to
user images can exploit these tools for malicious edits. Recent defenses
attempt to protect images by adding a limited noise in the pixel space to
disrupt the functioning of diffusion-based editing models. However, the
adversarial noise added by previous methods is easily noticeable to the human
eye. Moreover, most of these methods are not robust to purification techniques
like JPEG compression under a feasible pixel budget. We propose a novel
optimization approach that introduces adversarial perturbations directly in the
frequency domain by modifying the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients
of the input image. By leveraging the JPEG pipeline, our method generates
adversarial images that effectively prevent malicious image editing. Extensive
experiments across a variety of tasks and datasets demonstrate that our
approach introduces fewer visual artifacts while maintaining similar levels of
edit protection and robustness to noise purification techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体表情包因结合视觉和文本线索而难以检测仇恨内容，需要更高效的多模态理解方法。

Method: CAMU利用大型视觉-语言模型生成描述性标题，通过评分网络突出仇恨相关内容，并微调CLIP文本编码器以优化多模态理解。

Result: CAMU在Hateful Memes数据集上达到0.807准确率和0.806 F1分数，在MultiOFF数据集上F1分数为0.673，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAMU通过高效的参数微调和多模态理解，为仇恨和冒犯性表情包检测提供了实用且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Social media memes are a challenging domain for hate detection because they
intertwine visual and textual cues into culturally nuanced messages. We
introduce a novel framework, CAMU, which leverages large vision-language models
to generate more descriptive captions, a caption-scoring neural network to
emphasise hate-relevant content, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of CLIP's
text encoder for an improved multimodal understanding of memes. Experiments on
publicly available hateful meme datasets show that simple projection layer
fine-tuning yields modest gains, whereas selectively tuning deeper text encoder
layers significantly boosts performance on all evaluation metrics. Moreover,
our approach attains high accuracy (0.807) and F1-score (0.806) on the Hateful
Memes dataset, at par with the existing SoTA framework while being much more
efficient, offering practical advantages in real-world scenarios that rely on
fixed decision thresholds. CAMU also achieves the best F1-score of 0.673 on the
MultiOFF dataset for offensive meme identification, demonstrating its
generalisability. Additional analyses on benign confounders reveal that robust
visual grounding and nuanced text representations are crucial for reliable hate
and offence detection. We will publicly release CAMU along with the resultant
models for further research.
  Disclaimer: This paper includes references to potentially disturbing,
hateful, or offensive content due to the nature of the task.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 该论文研究了在血液成分分析中使用掩码自编码器（MAE）和视觉变换器（ViT）的方法，通过调整掩码比例和补丁大小优化图像重建，并利用预训练权重提升小目标的分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 血液成分检测和分类中，小像素目标在相似背景中的识别是一个挑战，传统深度学习方法在域外图像上表现不佳，因此探索自监督学习策略。

Method: 采用MAE学习ViT编码器表示，调整掩码比例和补丁大小优化重建，并将编码器权重用于U-Net Transformer进行语义分割。

Result: 实验表明，较小的掩码比例和补丁大小改善了MAE的图像重建，预训练权重对小尺寸血液成分的分割效果更佳。

Conclusion: 该方法为小目标的分割和分类提供了一种高效有效的策略。

Abstract: The hematology analytics used for detection and classification of small blood
components is a significant challenge. In particular, when objects exists as
small pixel-sized entities in a large context of similar objects. Deep learning
approaches using supervised models with pre-trained weights, such as residual
networks and vision transformers have demonstrated success for many
applications. Unfortunately, when applied to images outside the domain of
learned representations, these methods often result with less than acceptable
performance. A strategy to overcome this can be achieved by using
self-supervised models, where representations are learned and weights are then
applied for downstream applications. Recently, masked autoencoders have proven
to be effective to obtain representations that captures global context
information. By masking regions of an image and having the model learn to
reconstruct both the masked and non-masked regions, weights can be used for
various applications. However, if the sizes of the objects in images are less
than the size of the mask, the global context information is lost, making it
almost impossible to reconstruct the image. In this study, we investigated the
effect of mask ratios and patch sizes for blood components using a MAE to
obtain learned ViT encoder representations. We then applied the encoder weights
to train a U-Net Transformer for semantic segmentation to obtain both local and
global contextual information. Our experimental results demonstrates that both
smaller mask ratios and patch sizes improve the reconstruction of images using
a MAE. We also show the results of semantic segmentation with and without
pre-trained weights, where smaller-sized blood components benefited with
pre-training. Overall, our proposed method offers an efficient and effective
strategy for the segmentation and classification of small objects.

*Yabing Wang,Zhuotao Tian,Qingpei Guo,Zheng Qin,Sanping Zhou,Ming Yang,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架，通过增强图像到伪词标记的学习和优化文本编码器，解决了零样本组合图像检索中的三个关键挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合图像检索（CIR）任务由于标注成本高，零样本方法成为替代方案。现有投影方法存在伪词标记表示能力不足、训练与推理阶段差异及依赖大规模合成数据的问题。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段通过视觉语义注入模块和软文本对齐目标增强图像到伪词标记学习；第二阶段利用少量合成数据优化文本编码器，提取组合语义。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上进行了广泛实验，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法兼容高低质量合成数据，仅需少量数据即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a challenging multimodal task that
retrieves a target image based on a reference image and accompanying
modification text. Due to the high cost of annotating CIR triplet datasets,
zero-shot (ZS) CIR has gained traction as a promising alternative. Existing
studies mainly focus on projection-based methods, which map an image to a
single pseudo-word token. However, these methods face three critical
challenges: (1) insufficient pseudo-word token representation capacity, (2)
discrepancies between training and inference phases, and (3) reliance on
large-scale synthetic data. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage
framework where the training is accomplished from mapping to composing. In the
first stage, we enhance image-to-pseudo-word token learning by introducing a
visual semantic injection module and a soft text alignment objective, enabling
the token to capture richer and fine-grained image information. In the second
stage, we optimize the text encoder using a small amount of synthetic triplet
data, enabling it to effectively extract compositional semantics by combining
pseudo-word tokens with modification text for accurate target image retrieval.
The strong visual-to-pseudo mapping established in the first stage provides a
solid foundation for the second stage, making our approach compatible with both
high- and low-quality synthetic data, and capable of achieving significant
performance gains with only a small amount of synthetic data. Extensive
experiments were conducted on three public datasets, achieving superior
performance compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: RSRNav通过建模目标与当前观测的空间关系，解决了传统ImageNav方法中语义特征方向信息不足和视角不一致的问题，显著提升了导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ImageNav方法中，语义特征缺乏准确的方向信息，导致冗余动作，且训练与应用时的视角不一致会显著降低性能。

Method: RSRNav通过构建目标与当前观测的空间相关性，并利用细粒度互相关和方向感知相关性逐步优化，为策略网络提供导航指导。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的评估显示，RSRNav在导航性能上表现优越，尤其在“用户匹配目标”设置中。

Conclusion: RSRNav通过空间关系建模，显著提升了导航性能，展示了其在现实应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent image-goal navigation (ImageNav) methods learn a perception-action
policy by separately capturing semantic features of the goal and egocentric
images, then passing them to a policy network. However, challenges remain: (1)
Semantic features often fail to provide accurate directional information,
leading to superfluous actions, and (2) performance drops significantly when
viewpoint inconsistencies arise between training and application. To address
these challenges, we propose RSRNav, a simple yet effective method that reasons
spatial relationships between the goal and current observations as navigation
guidance. Specifically, we model the spatial relationship by constructing
correlations between the goal and current observations, which are then passed
to the policy network for action prediction. These correlations are
progressively refined using fine-grained cross-correlation and direction-aware
correlation for more precise navigation. Extensive evaluation of RSRNav on
three benchmark datasets demonstrates superior navigation performance,
particularly in the "user-matched goal" setting, highlighting its potential for
real-world applications.

Method: 提出LVTP框架，结合多尺度Tsallis熵和低层视觉特征，通过动态评分机制和两次聚类优化剪枝。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现20%-45%计算成本降低，性能损失可忽略，尤其在复杂边缘区域表现优异。

Conclusion: LVTP在计算成本与精度平衡上优于现有方法，无需额外训练或架构修改。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in semantic segmentation but demand
significant computation, posing challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Existing token pruning methods often overlook
fundamental visual data characteristics. This study introduces 'LVTP', a
progressive token pruning framework guided by multi-scale Tsallis entropy and
low-level visual features with twice clustering. It integrates high-level
semantics and basic visual attributes for precise segmentation. A novel dynamic
scoring mechanism using multi-scale Tsallis entropy weighting overcomes
limitations of traditional single-parameter entropy. The framework also
incorporates low-level feature analysis to preserve critical edge information
while optimizing computational cost. As a plug-and-play module, it requires no
architectural changes or additional training. Evaluations across multiple
datasets show 20%-45% computational reductions with negligible performance
loss, outperforming existing methods in balancing cost and accuracy, especially
in complex edge regions.

TLDR: 提出了一种联邦客户端定制适配器（FCA）框架，用于医学图像分割，解决了分布式数据岛屿和客户端领域异质性带来的训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割在X射线图像中对计算机辅助诊断和病变定位有益，但现有方法依赖集中式学习，不适用于分布式数据场景。联邦学习虽提供分布式解决方案，但面临客户端领域异质性导致的训练不稳定问题。

Method: FCA框架利用现成的医学基础模型中的通用知识稳定联邦训练，并开发两种客户端定制联邦更新策略，自适应分解适配器为通用和个体组件，分别更新参数组。

Result: 在三个大规模数据集上的实验证明了FCA框架在联邦医学分割中的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: FCA框架实现了稳定且客户端定制的自适应分割，无需共享敏感本地数据，解决了联邦学习中的异质性问题。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation in X-ray images is beneficial for computer-aided
diagnosis and lesion localization. Existing methods mainly fall into a
centralized learning paradigm, which is inapplicable in the practical medical
scenario that only has access to distributed data islands. Federated Learning
has the potential to offer a distributed solution but struggles with heavy
training instability due to client-wise domain heterogeneity (including
distribution diversity and class imbalance). In this paper, we propose a novel
Federated Client-tailored Adapter (FCA) framework for medical image
segmentation, which achieves stable and client-tailored adaptive segmentation
without sharing sensitive local data. Specifically, the federated adapter stirs
universal knowledge in off-the-shelf medical foundation models to stabilize the
federated training process. In addition, we develop two client-tailored
federated updating strategies that adaptively decompose the adapter into common
and individual components, then globally and independently update the parameter
groups associated with common client-invariant and individual client-specific
units, respectively. They further stabilize the heterogeneous federated
learning process and realize optimal client-tailored instead of sub-optimal
global-compromised segmentation models. Extensive experiments on three
large-scale datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed FCA framework for federated medical segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种名为BSaTa的框架，通过显式建模身体形状信息提升VIReID性能，结合文本对齐和视觉一致性正则化，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖身份标签监督，难以充分提取高层语义信息，且未显式建模身体形状特征，而这对跨模态匹配至关重要。

Method: 设计了BSTA模块提取身体形状信息并转为文本表示，TVCR确保文本与视觉特征对齐，SRL机制结合多文本监督和分布一致性约束。

Result: 在SYSU-MM01和RegDB数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: BSaTa框架通过显式建模身体形状信息，显著提升了VIReID性能。

Abstract: Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification (VIReID) aims to match visible and
infrared pedestrian images, but the modality differences and the complexity of
identity features make it challenging. Existing methods rely solely on identity
label supervision, which makes it difficult to fully extract high-level
semantic information. Recently, vision-language pre-trained models have been
introduced to VIReID, enhancing semantic information modeling by generating
textual descriptions. However, such methods do not explicitly model body shape
features, which are crucial for cross-modal matching. To address this, we
propose an effective Body Shape-aware Textual Alignment (BSaTa) framework that
explicitly models and utilizes body shape information to improve VIReID
performance. Specifically, we design a Body Shape Textual Alignment (BSTA)
module that extracts body shape information using a human parsing model and
converts it into structured text representations via CLIP. We also design a
Text-Visual Consistency Regularizer (TVCR) to ensure alignment between body
shape textual representations and visual body shape features. Furthermore, we
introduce a Shape-aware Representation Learning (SRL) mechanism that combines
Multi-text Supervision and Distribution Consistency Constraints to guide the
visual encoder to learn modality-invariant and discriminative identity
features, thus enhancing modality invariance. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance on the SYSU-MM01 and RegDB
datasets, validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: It is a challenging task for visually impaired people to perceive their
surrounding environment due to the complexity of the natural scenes. Their
personal and social activities are thus highly limited. This paper introduces a
Large Vision-Language Model(LVLM) based environment perception system which
helps them to better understand the surrounding environment, by capturing the
current scene they face with a wearable device, and then letting them retrieve
the analysis results through the device. The visually impaired people could
acquire a global description of the scene by long pressing the screen to
activate the LVLM output, retrieve the categories of the objects in the scene
resulting from a segmentation model by tapping or swiping the screen, and get a
detailed description of the objects they are interested in by double-tapping
the screen. To help visually impaired people more accurately perceive the
world, this paper proposes incorporating the segmentation result of the RGB
image as external knowledge into the input of LVLM to reduce the LVLM's
hallucination. Technical experiments on POPE, MME and LLaVA-QA90 show that the
system could provide a more accurate description of the scene compared to
Qwen-VL-Chat, exploratory experiments show that the system helps visually
impaired people to perceive the surrounding environment effectively.

Method: 提出PRSS方法，结合提示重新锚定（PR）和语义提示搜索（SS），优化隐私与效用的权衡。

Result: 实验表明，PRSS在不同隐私级别下均显著提升了隐私与效用的平衡，达到新最优水平。

Conclusion: PRSS为扩散模型提供了一种有效的方法，在保护隐私的同时保持高输出效用。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
creating images highly aligned with user prompts, yet their proclivity for
memorizing training set images has sparked concerns about the originality of
the generated images and privacy issues, potentially leading to legal
complications for both model owners and users, particularly when the memorized
images contain proprietary content. Although methods to mitigate these issues
have been suggested, enhancing privacy often results in a significant decrease
in the utility of the outputs, as indicated by text-alignment scores. To bridge
the research gap, we introduce a novel method, PRSS, which refines the
classifier-free guidance approach in diffusion models by integrating prompt
re-anchoring (PR) to improve privacy and incorporating semantic prompt search
(SS) to enhance utility. Extensive experiments across various privacy levels
demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the privacy-utility
trade-off, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Ophthalmic diseases pose a significant global health challenge, yet

Abstract: In the field of medical imaging, the advent of deep learning, especially the
application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has revolutionized the
analysis and interpretation of medical images. Nevertheless, deep learning
methods usually rely on large amounts of labeled data. In medical imaging
research, the acquisition of high-quality labels is both expensive and
difficult. The introduction of Vision Transformers (ViT) and self-supervised
learning provides a pre-training strategy that utilizes abundant unlabeled
data, effectively alleviating the label acquisition challenge while broadening
the breadth of data utilization. However, ViT's high computational density and
substantial demand for computing power, coupled with the lack of localization
characteristics of its operations on image patches, limit its efficiency and
applicability in many application scenarios. In this study, we employ
nn-MobileNet, a lightweight CNN framework, to implement a BERT-style
self-supervised learning approach. We pre-train the network on the unlabeled
retinal fundus images from the UK Biobank to improve downstream application
performance. We validate the results of the pre-trained model on Alzheimer's
disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and various retinal diseases
identification. The results show that our approach can significantly improve
performance in the downstream tasks. In summary, this study combines the
benefits of CNNs with the capabilities of advanced self-supervised learning in
handling large-scale unlabeled data, demonstrating the potential of CNNs in the
presence of label scarcity.

devices, research in human action recognition is gaining prominence. Typically,
models deployed on immersive computing devices are static and limited to their
default set of classes. The goal of our research is to provide users and
developers with the capability to personalize their experience by adding new
action classes to their device models continually. Importantly, a user should
be able to add new classes in a low-shot and efficient manner, while this
process should not require storing or replaying any of user's sensitive
training data. We formalize this problem as privacy-aware few-shot continual
action recognition. Towards this end, we propose POET: Prompt-Offset Tuning.
While existing prompt tuning approaches have shown great promise for continual
learning of image, text, and video modalities; they demand access to
extensively pretrained transformers. Breaking away from this assumption, POET
demonstrates the efficacy of prompt tuning a significantly lightweight
backbone, pretrained exclusively on the base class data. We propose a novel
spatio-temporal learnable prompt offset tuning approach, and are the first to
apply such prompt tuning to Graph Neural Networks. We contribute two new
benchmarks for our new problem setting in human action recognition: (i) NTU
RGB+D dataset for activity recognition, and (ii) SHREC-2017 dataset for hand
gesture recognition. We find that POET consistently outperforms comprehensive
benchmarks. Source code at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D多目标跟踪在机器人学和计算机视觉中至关重要，但现有方法难以从2D视频流中挖掘3D时空关联。

Method: 1. HSSM：高效数据关联机制；2. FCOE：改进目标重识别；3. VeloSSM：增强6-DoF姿态估计。

Result: 在KITTI测试中达到76.86 HOTA（31 FPS），显著优于之前最佳方法。

Conclusion: 方法在单目3D多目标跟踪任务中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable multi-object tracking (MOT) in 3D space is essential
for advancing robotics and computer vision applications. However, it remains a
significant challenge in monocular setups due to the difficulty of mining 3D
spatiotemporal associations from 2D video streams. In this work, we present
three innovative techniques to enhance the fusion and exploitation of
heterogeneous cues for monocular 3D MOT: (1) we introduce the Hungarian State
Space Model (HSSM), a novel data association mechanism that compresses
contextual tracking cues across multiple paths, enabling efficient and
comprehensive assignment decisions with linear complexity. HSSM features a
global receptive field and dynamic weights, in contrast to traditional linear
assignment algorithms that rely on hand-crafted association costs. (2) We
propose Fully Convolutional One-stage Embedding (FCOE), which eliminates ROI
pooling by directly using dense feature maps for contrastive learning, thus
improving object re-identification accuracy under challenging conditions such
as varying viewpoints and lighting. (3) We enhance 6-DoF pose estimation
through VeloSSM, an encoder-decoder architecture that models temporal
dependencies in velocity to capture motion dynamics, overcoming the limitations
of frame-based 3D inference. Experiments on the KITTI public test benchmark
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a new state-of-the-art
performance of 76.86~HOTA at 31~FPS. Our approach outperforms the previous best
by significant margins of +2.63~HOTA and +3.62~AssA, showcasing its robustness
and efficiency for monocular 3D MOT tasks. The code and models are available at

Result: 在MEAD和HDTF数据集上表现优越，情感准确性超过现有方法，同时保持唇同步性能。

Conclusion: DICE-Talk能生成身份保留且情感丰富的肖像，适应未见身份，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Talking Head Generation (THG) have achieved impressive lip
synchronization and visual quality through diffusion models; yet existing
methods struggle to generate emotionally expressive portraits while preserving
speaker identity. We identify three critical limitations in current emotional
talking head generation: insufficient utilization of audio's inherent emotional
cues, identity leakage in emotion representations, and isolated learning of
emotion correlations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
dubbed as DICE-Talk, following the idea of disentangling identity with emotion,
and then cooperating emotions with similar characteristics. First, we develop a
disentangled emotion embedder that jointly models audio-visual emotional cues
through cross-modal attention, representing emotions as identity-agnostic
Gaussian distributions. Second, we introduce a correlation-enhanced emotion
conditioning module with learnable Emotion Banks that explicitly capture
inter-emotion relationships through vector quantization and attention-based
feature aggregation. Third, we design an emotion discrimination objective that
enforces affective consistency during the diffusion process through
latent-space classification. Extensive experiments on MEAD and HDTF datasets
demonstrate our method's superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches
in emotion accuracy while maintaining competitive lip-sync performance.
Qualitative results and user studies further confirm our method's ability to
generate identity-preserving portraits with rich, correlated emotional
expressions that naturally adapt to unseen identities.

Abstract: Spacecraft image super-resolution seeks to enhance low-resolution spacecraft
images into high-resolution ones. Although existing arbitrary-scale
super-resolution methods perform well on general images, they tend to overlook
the difference in features between the spacecraft core region and the large
black space background, introducing irrelevant noise. In this paper, we propose
a salient region-guided spacecraft image arbitrary-scale super-resolution
network (SGSASR), which uses features from the spacecraft core salient regions
to guide latent modulation and achieve arbitrary-scale super-resolution.
Specifically, we design a spacecraft core region recognition block (SCRRB) that
identifies the core salient regions in spacecraft images using a pre-trained
saliency detection model. Furthermore, we present an adaptive-weighted feature
fusion enhancement mechanism (AFFEM) to selectively aggregate the spacecraft
core region features with general image features by dynamic weight parameter to
enhance the response of the core salient regions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed SGSASR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: 在VisDrone2019数据集上，MASF-YOLO-s相比YOLOv11-s在mAP@0.5和mAP@0.5:0.95上分别提升了4.6%和3.5%，且参数和计算成本更低。

Conclusion: MASF-YOLO在检测精度和模型效率上均具有显著优势，为无人机图像目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and computer
vision technologies, object detection from UAV perspectives has emerged as a
prominent research area. However, challenges for detection brought by the
extremely small proportion of target pixels, significant scale variations of
objects, and complex background information in UAV images have greatly limited
the practical applications of UAV. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel object detection network Multi-scale Context Aggregation and
Scale-adaptive Fusion YOLO (MASF-YOLO), which is developed based on YOLOv11.
Firstly, to tackle the difficulty of detecting small objects in UAV images, we
design a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Module (MFAM), which significantly
improves the detection accuracy of small objects through parallel multi-scale
convolutions and feature fusion. Secondly, to mitigate the interference of
background noise, we propose an Improved Efficient Multi-scale Attention Module
(IEMA), which enhances the focus on target regions through feature grouping,
parallel sub-networks, and cross-spatial learning. Thirdly, we introduce a
Dimension-Aware Selective Integration Module (DASI), which further enhances
multi-scale feature fusion capabilities by adaptively weighting and fusing
low-dimensional features and high-dimensional features. Finally, we conducted
extensive performance evaluations of our proposed method on the VisDrone2019
dataset. Compared to YOLOv11-s, MASFYOLO-s achieves improvements of 4.6% in
mAP@0.5 and 3.5% in mAP@0.5:0.95 on the VisDrone2019 validation set.
Remarkably, MASF-YOLO-s outperforms YOLOv11-m while requiring only
approximately 60% of its parameters and 65% of its computational cost.
Furthermore, comparative experiments with state-of-the-art detectors confirm
that MASF-YOLO-s maintains a clear competitive advantage in both detection
accuracy and model efficiency.

Abstract: Fine-grained understanding of human actions and poses in videos is essential
for human-centric AI applications. In this work, we introduce ActionArt, a
fine-grained video-caption dataset designed to advance research in
human-centric multimodal understanding. Our dataset comprises thousands of
videos capturing a broad spectrum of human actions, human-object interactions,
and diverse scenarios, each accompanied by detailed annotations that
meticulously label every limb movement. We develop eight sub-tasks to evaluate
the fine-grained understanding capabilities of existing large multimodal models
across different dimensions. Experimental results indicate that, while current
large multimodal models perform commendably on various tasks, they often fall
short in achieving fine-grained understanding. We attribute this limitation to
the scarcity of meticulously annotated data, which is both costly and difficult
to scale manually. Since manual annotations are costly and hard to scale, we
propose proxy tasks to enhance the model perception ability in both spatial and
temporal dimensions. These proxy tasks are carefully crafted to be driven by
data automatically generated from existing MLLMs, thereby reducing the reliance
on costly manual labels. Experimental results show that the proposed proxy
tasks significantly narrow the gap toward the performance achieved with
manually annotated fine-grained data.

Result: 在标准视觉任务中，E-InMeMo显著优于现有方法，mIoU提升7.99（前景分割）和17.04（单目标检测）。

Conclusion: E-InMeMo是一种轻量且有效的视觉ICL优化策略。

Abstract: Large-scale models trained on extensive datasets have become the standard due
to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks. In-context learning
(ICL), widely used in natural language processing, leverages these models by
providing task-specific prompts without modifying their parameters. This
paradigm is increasingly being adapted for computer vision, where models
receive an input-output image pair, known as an in-context pair, alongside a
query image to illustrate the desired output. However, the success of visual
ICL largely hinges on the quality of these prompts. To address this, we propose
Enhanced Instruct Me More (E-InMeMo), a novel approach that incorporates
learnable perturbations into in-context pairs to optimize prompting. Through
extensive experiments on standard vision tasks, E-InMeMo demonstrates superior
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it improves mIoU
scores by 7.99 for foreground segmentation and by 17.04 for single object
detection when compared to the baseline without learnable prompts. These
results highlight E-InMeMo as a lightweight yet effective strategy for
enhancing visual ICL. Code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了现有深度子空间聚类方法的局限性，提升了聚类质量并减少了对标签和调参的依赖。

Abstract: Deep subspace clustering (DSC) algorithms face several challenges that hinder
their widespread adoption across variois application domains. First, clustering
quality is typically assessed using only the encoder's output layer,
disregarding valuable information present in the intermediate layers. Second,
most DSC approaches treat representation learning and subspace clustering as
independent tasks, limiting their effectiveness. Third, they assume the
availability of a held-out dataset for hyperparameter tuning, which is often
impractical in real-world scenarios. Fourth, learning termination is commonly
based on clustering error monitoring, requiring external labels. Finally, their
performance often depends on post-processing techniques that rely on labeled
data. To address this limitations, we introduce a novel single-view DSC
approach that: (i) minimizes a layer-wise self expression loss using a joint
representation matrix; (ii) optimizes a subspace-structured norm to enhance
clustering quality; (iii) employs a multi-stage sequential learning framework,
consisting of pre-training and fine-tuning, enabling the use of multiple
regularization terms without hyperparameter tuning; (iv) incorporates a
relative error-based self-stopping mechanism to terminate training without
labels; and (v) retains a fixed number of leading coefficients in the learned
representation matrix based on prior knowledge. We evaluate the proposed method
on six datasets representing faces, digits, and objects. The results show that
our method outperforms most linear SC algorithms with careffulyl tuned
hyperparameters while maintaining competitive performance with the best
performing linear appoaches.

Result: UDA在合成数据场景中表现优于源域微调，但在多样化真实数据中效果有限；少量目标标签可使UDA达到全监督模型的性能。

Conclusion: UDA在某些场景下有优势，但需结合具体数据情况选择方法，以支持自动驾驶的规模化应用。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) can improve a perception model's
generalization to an unlabeled target domain starting from a labeled source
domain. UDA using Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with synthetic source data
can achieve generalization performance comparable to fully-supervised learning
with real target data. However, because VFMs have strong generalization from
their pre-training, more straightforward, source-only fine-tuning can also
perform well on the target. As data scenarios used in academic research are not
necessarily representative for real-world applications, it is currently unclear
(a) how UDA behaves with more representative and diverse data and (b) if
source-only fine-tuning of VFMs can perform equally well in these scenarios.
Our research aims to close these gaps and, similar to previous studies, we
focus on semantic segmentation as a representative perception task. We assess
UDA for synth-to-real and real-to-real use cases with different source and
target data combinations. We also investigate the effect of using a small
amount of labeled target data in UDA. We clarify that while these scenarios are
more realistic, they are not necessarily more challenging. Our results show
that, when using stronger synthetic source data, UDA's improvement over
source-only fine-tuning of VFMs reduces from +8 mIoU to +2 mIoU, and when using
more diverse real source data, UDA has no added value. However, UDA
generalization is always higher in all synthetic data scenarios than
source-only fine-tuning and, when including only 1/16 of Cityscapes labels,
synthetic UDA obtains the same state-of-the-art segmentation quality of 85 mIoU
as a fully-supervised model using all labels. Considering the mixed results, we
discuss how UDA can best support robust autonomous driving at scale.

Result: 在Intentonomy和MDID数据集上取得最先进性能，同时具备良好的可解释性。

Conclusion: MCCL为理解复杂多样的人类表达形式提供了新思路。

Abstract: In an era where social media platforms abound, individuals frequently share
images that offer insights into their intents and interests, impacting
individual life quality and societal stability. Traditional computer vision
tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation, focus on concrete
visual representations, while intent recognition relies more on implicit visual
clues. This poses challenges due to the wide variation and subjectivity of such
clues, compounded by the problem of intra-class variety in conveying abstract
concepts, e.g. "enjoy life". Existing methods seek to solve the problem by
manually designing representative features or building prototypes for each
class from global features. However, these methods still struggle to deal with
the large visual diversity of each intent category. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach named Multi-grained Compositional visual Clue Learning (MCCL)
to address these challenges for image intent recognition. Our method leverages
the systematic compositionality of human cognition by breaking down intent
recognition into visual clue composition and integrating multi-grained
features. We adopt class-specific prototypes to alleviate data imbalance. We
treat intent recognition as a multi-label classification problem, using a graph
convolutional network to infuse prior knowledge through label embedding
correlations. Demonstrated by a state-of-the-art performance on the Intentonomy
and MDID datasets, our approach advances the accuracy of existing methods while
also possessing good interpretability. Our work provides an attempt for future
explorations in understanding complex and miscellaneous forms of human
expression.

Abstract: Railway systems, particularly in Germany, require high levels of automation
to address legacy infrastructure challenges and increase train traffic safely.
A key component of automation is robust long-range perception, essential for
early hazard detection, such as obstacles at level crossings or pedestrians on
tracks. Unlike automotive systems with braking distances of ~70 meters, trains
require perception ranges exceeding 1 km. This paper presents an
deep-learning-based approach for long-range 3D object detection tailored for
autonomous trains. The method relies solely on monocular images, inspired by
the Faraway-Frustum approach, and incorporates LiDAR data during training to
improve depth estimation. The proposed pipeline consists of four key modules:
(1) a modified YOLOv9 for 2.5D object detection, (2) a depth estimation
network, and (3-4) dedicated short- and long-range 3D detection heads.
Evaluations on the OSDaR23 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
approach in detecting objects up to 250 meters. Results highlight its potential
for railway automation and outline areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Generative AI has significantly changed industries by enabling text-driven
image generation, yet challenges remain in achieving high-resolution outputs
that align with fine-grained user preferences. Consequently, multi-round
interactions are necessary to ensure the generated images meet expectations.
Previous methods enhanced prompts via reward feedback but did not optimize over
a multi-round dialogue dataset. In this work, we present a Visual Co-Adaptation
(VCA) framework incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback, leveraging a
well-trained reward model aligned with human preferences. Using a diverse
multi-turn dialogue dataset, our framework applies multiple reward functions,
such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback, while fine-tuning the
diffusion model through LoRA, thus optimizing image generation based on user
input. We also construct multi-round dialogue datasets of prompts and image
pairs aligned with user intent. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly improving image
consistency and alignment with user intent. Our approach consistently surpasses
competing models in user satisfaction, especially in multi-turn dialogue

Abstract: LiDAR-based semantic segmentation is critical for autonomous trains,
requiring accurate predictions across varying distances. This paper introduces
two targeted data augmentation methods designed to improve segmentation
performance on the railway-specific OSDaR23 dataset. The person instance
pasting method enhances segmentation of pedestrians at distant ranges by
injecting realistic variations into the dataset. The track sparsification
method redistributes point density in LiDAR scans, improving track segmentation
at far distances with minimal impact on close-range accuracy. Both methods are
evaluated using a state-of-the-art 3D semantic segmentation network,
demonstrating significant improvements in distant-range performance while
maintaining robustness in close-range predictions. We establish the first 3D
semantic segmentation benchmark for OSDaR23, demonstrating the potential of
data-centric approaches to address railway-specific challenges in autonomous
train perception.

Abstract: Monocular 3D clothed human reconstruction aims to create a complete 3D avatar
from a single image. To tackle the human geometry lacking in one RGB image,
current methods typically resort to a preceding model for an explicit geometric
representation. For the reconstruction itself, focus is on modeling both it and
the input image. This routine is constrained by the preceding model, and
overlooks the integrity of the reconstruction task. To address this, this paper
introduces a novel paradigm that treats human reconstruction as a holistic
process, utilizing an end-to-end network for direct prediction from 2D image to
3D avatar, eliminating any explicit intermediate geometry display. Based on
this, we further propose a novel reconstruction framework consisting of two
core components: the Anatomy Shaping Extraction module, which captures implicit
shape features taking into account the specialty of human anatomy, and the
Twins Negotiating Reconstruction U-Net, which enhances reconstruction through
feature interaction between two U-Nets of different modalities. Moreover, we
propose a Comic Data Augmentation strategy and construct 15k+ 3D human scans to
bolster model performance in more complex case input. Extensive experiments on
two test sets and many in-the-wild cases show the superiority of our method
over SOTA methods. Our demos can be found in :

Abstract: The field of monocular depth estimation is continually evolving with the
advent of numerous innovative models and extensions. However, research on
monocular depth estimation methods specifically for underwater scenes remains
limited, compounded by a scarcity of relevant data and methodological support.
This paper proposes a novel approach to address the existing challenges in
current monocular depth estimation methods for underwater environments. We
construct an economically efficient dataset suitable for underwater scenarios
by employing multi-view depth estimation to generate supervisory signals and
corresponding enhanced underwater images. we introduces a texture-depth fusion
module, designed according to the underwater optical imaging principles, which
aims to effectively exploit and integrate depth information from texture cues.
Experimental results on the FLSea dataset demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves the accuracy and adaptability of models in underwater
settings. This work offers a cost-effective solution for monocular underwater
depth estimation and holds considerable promise for practical applications.

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired sensors that detect light changes
asynchronously for each pixel. They are increasingly used in fields like
computer vision and robotics because of several advantages over traditional
frame-based cameras, such as high temporal resolution, low latency, and high
dynamic range. As with any camera, the output's quality depends on how well the
camera's settings, called biases for event-based cameras, are configured. While
frame-based cameras have advanced automatic configuration algorithms, there are
very few such tools for tuning these biases. A systematic testing framework
would require observing the same scene with different biases, which is tricky
since event cameras only generate events when there is movement. Event
simulators exist, but since biases heavily depend on the electrical circuit and
the pixel design, available simulators are not well suited for bias tuning. To
allow reproducibility, we present BiasBench, a novel event dataset containing
multiple scenes with settings sampled in a grid-like pattern. We present three
different scenes, each with a quality metric of the downstream application.
Additionally, we present a novel, RL-based method to facilitate online bias
adjustments.

Abstract: With the exacerbation of the biodiversity and climate crises, macroecological
pursuits such as global biodiversity mapping become more urgent. Remote sensing
offers a wealth of Earth observation data for ecological studies, but the
scarcity of labeled datasets remains a major challenge. Recently,
self-supervised learning has enabled learning representations from unlabeled
data, triggering the development of pretrained geospatial models with
generalizable features. However, these models are often trained on datasets
biased toward areas of high human activity, leaving entire ecological regions
underrepresented. Additionally, while some datasets attempt to address
seasonality through multi-date imagery, they typically follow calendar seasons
rather than local phenological cycles. To better capture vegetation seasonality
at a global scale, we propose a simple phenology-informed sampling strategy and
introduce corresponding SSL4Eco, a multi-date Sentinel-2 dataset, on which we
train an existing model with a season-contrastive objective. We compare
representations learned from SSL4Eco against other datasets on diverse
ecological downstream tasks and demonstrate that our straightforward sampling
method consistently improves representation quality, highlighting the
importance of dataset construction. The model pretrained on SSL4Eco reaches
state of the art performance on 7 out of 8 downstream tasks spanning
(multi-label) classification and regression. We release our code, data, and
model weights to support macroecological and computer vision research at

Conclusion: AV-GAS模型成功解决了从混合音频生成图像的挑战，为音频-视觉生成任务提供了新思路和评估标准。

Abstract: Recent audio-visual generative models have made substantial progress in
generating images from audio. However, existing approaches focus on generating
images from single-class audio and fail to generate images from mixed audio. To
address this, we propose an Audio-Visual Generation and Separation model
(AV-GAS) for generating images from soundscapes (mixed audio containing
multiple classes). Our contribution is threefold: First, we propose a new
challenge in the audio-visual generation task, which is to generate an image
given a multi-class audio input, and we propose a method that solves this task
using an audio-visual separator. Second, we introduce a new audio-visual
separation task, which involves generating separate images for each class
present in a mixed audio input. Lastly, we propose new evaluation metrics for
the audio-visual generation task: Class Representation Score (CRS) and a
modified R@K. Our model is trained and evaluated on the VGGSound dataset. We
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving 7% higher CRS
and 4% higher R@2* in generating plausible images with mixed audio.

Abstract: This contribution explores the impact of synthetic training data usage and
the prediction of material wear and aging in the context of re-identification.
Different experimental setups and gallery set expanding strategies are tested,
analyzing their impact on performance over time for aging re-identification
subjects. Using a continuously updating gallery, we were able to increase our
mean Rank-1 accuracy by 24%, as material aging was taken into account step by
step. In addition, using models trained with 10% artificial training data,
Rank-1 accuracy could be increased by up to 13%, in comparison to a model
trained on only real-world data, significantly boosting generalized performance
on hold-out data. Finally, this work introduces a novel, open-source
re-identification dataset, pallet-block-2696. This dataset contains 2,696
images of Euro pallets, taken over a period of 4 months. During this time,
natural aging processes occurred and some of the pallets were damaged during
their usage. These wear and tear processes significantly changed the appearance
of the pallets, providing a dataset that can be used to generate synthetically
aged pallets or other wooden materials.

Abstract: To support the Low Altitude Economy (LAE), precise unmanned aerial vehicles

signals are unavailable. Vision-based methods offer a viable alternative but
face severe bandwidth, memory and processing constraints on lightweight UAVs.
Inspired by mammalian spatial cognition, we propose a task-oriented
communication framework, where UAVs equipped with multi-camera systems extract
compact multi-view features and offload localization tasks to edge servers. We
introduce the Orthogonally-constrained Variational Information Bottleneck
encoder (O-VIB), which incorporates automatic relevance determination (ARD) to
prune non-informative features while enforcing orthogonality to minimize
redundancy. This enables efficient and accurate localization with minimal
transmission cost. Extensive evaluation on a dedicated LAE UAV dataset shows
that O-VIB achieves high-precision localization under stringent bandwidth
budgets. Code and dataset will be made publicly available:

Result: 实验表明，STP4D能以约4.6秒/资产的速度生成高质量4D内容，质量和效率均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STP4D通过统一框架实现了高质量的文本到4D生成，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-to-4D generation is rapidly developing and widely applied in various
scenarios. However, existing methods often fail to incorporate adequate
spatio-temporal modeling and prompt alignment within a unified framework,
resulting in temporal inconsistencies, geometric distortions, or low-quality 4D
content that deviates from the provided texts. Therefore, we propose STP4D, a
novel approach that aims to integrate comprehensive spatio-temporal-prompt
consistency modeling for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Specifically,
STP4D employs three carefully designed modules: Time-varying Prompt Embedding,
Geometric Information Enhancement, and Temporal Extension Deformation, which
collaborate to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, STP4D is among the first
methods to exploit the Diffusion model to generate 4D Gaussians, combining the
fine-grained modeling capabilities and the real-time rendering process of 4DGS
with the rapid inference speed of the Diffusion model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that STP4D excels in generating high-fidelity 4D content with
exceptional efficiency (approximately 4.6s per asset), surpassing existing
methods in both quality and speed.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了单目3D车道检测中的深度信息重建问题，显著提升了检测精度。

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is challenging due to the difficulty in capturing
depth information from single-camera images. A common strategy involves
transforming front-view (FV) images into bird's-eye-view (BEV) space through
inverse perspective mapping (IPM), facilitating lane detection using BEV
features. However, IPM's flat-ground assumption and loss of contextual
information lead to inaccuracies in reconstructing 3D information, especially
height. In this paper, we introduce a BEV-based framework to address these
limitations and improve 3D lane detection accuracy. Our approach incorporates a
Hierarchical Depth-Aware Head that provides multi-scale depth features,
mitigating the flat-ground assumption by enhancing spatial awareness across
varying depths. Additionally, we leverage Depth Prior Distillation to transfer
semantic depth knowledge from a teacher model, capturing richer structural and
contextual information for complex lane structures. To further refine lane
continuity and ensure smooth lane reconstruction, we introduce a Conditional
Random Field module that enforces spatial coherence in lane predictions.
Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in terms of z-axis error and outperforms other methods in the field
in overall performance. The code is released at:

Result: 在AMASS数据集上表现优异，实现高精度和高效推理。

Conclusion: SSD-Poser在实时全身姿态估计任务中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The growing applications of AR/VR increase the demand for real-time full-body
pose estimation from Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs). Although HMDs provide joint
signals from the head and hands, reconstructing a full-body pose remains
challenging due to the unconstrained lower body. Recent advancements often rely
on conventional neural networks and generative models to improve performance in
this task, such as Transformers and diffusion models. However, these approaches
struggle to strike a balance between achieving precise pose reconstruction and
maintaining fast inference speed. To overcome these challenges, a lightweight
and efficient model, SSD-Poser, is designed for robust full-body motion
estimation from sparse observations. SSD-Poser incorporates a well-designed
hybrid encoder, State Space Attention Encoders, to adapt the state space
duality to complex motion poses and enable real-time realistic pose
reconstruction. Moreover, a Frequency-Aware Decoder is introduced to mitigate
jitter caused by variable-frequency motion signals, remarkably enhancing the
motion smoothness. Comprehensive experiments on the AMASS dataset demonstrate
that SSD-Poser achieves exceptional accuracy and computational efficiency,
showing outstanding inference efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中固定损失权重无法适应任务重要性和训练过程动态变化，影响隐写效果。

Result: 在ALASKA2、VOC2012和ImageNet数据集上实验表明，TSCL显著提升了隐写质量、解码准确性和安全性。

Conclusion: TSCL通过动态调整损失权重，有效平衡多任务学习，为深度学习图像隐写提供了新思路。

Abstract: For deep learning-based image steganography frameworks, in order to ensure
the invisibility and recoverability of the information embedding, the loss
function usually contains several losses such as embedding loss, recovery loss
and steganalysis loss. In previous research works, fixed loss weights are
usually chosen for training optimization, and this setting is not linked to the
importance of the steganography task itself and the training process. In this
paper, we propose a Two-stage Curriculum Learning loss scheduler (TSCL) for
balancing multinomial losses in deep learning image steganography algorithms.
TSCL consists of two phases: a priori curriculum control and loss dynamics
control. The first phase firstly focuses the model on learning the information
embedding of the original image by controlling the loss weights in the
multi-party adversarial training; secondly, it makes the model shift its
learning focus to improving the decoding accuracy; and finally, it makes the
model learn to generate a steganographic image that is resistant to
steganalysis. In the second stage, the learning speed of each training task is
evaluated by calculating the loss drop of the before and after iteration rounds
to balance the learning of each task. Experimental results on three large
public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed TSCL
strategy improves the quality of steganography, decoding accuracy and security.

Method: 分析现有MI基准的分布偏移问题，提出基于最优传输的度量方法，构建无偏新基准，并探讨MI的理论上限和实际可行性场景。

Result: 现有MI方法在无偏条件下表现接近随机猜测，理论分析显示MI在VLM中具有高不可约错误率，但在特定场景（如微调、真实文本访问）下可行。

Conclusion: MI在VLM中存在固有挑战，但通过针对性场景设计可实现有效审计，为未来可信数据审计提供指导。

Abstract: With the surge of large language models (LLMs), Large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs)--which integrate vision encoders with LLMs for accurate visual
grounding--have shown great potential in tasks like generalist agents and
robotic control. However, VLMs are typically trained on massive web-scraped
images, raising concerns over copyright infringement and privacy violations,
and making data auditing increasingly urgent. Membership inference (MI), which
determines whether a sample was used in training, has emerged as a key auditing
technique, with promising results on open-source VLMs like LLaVA (AUC > 80%).
In this work, we revisit these advances and uncover a critical issue: current
MI benchmarks suffer from distribution shifts between member and non-member
images, introducing shortcut cues that inflate MI performance. We further
analyze the nature of these shifts and propose a principled metric based on
optimal transport to quantify the distribution discrepancy. To evaluate MI in
realistic settings, we construct new benchmarks with i.i.d. member and
non-member images. Existing MI methods fail under these unbiased conditions,
performing only marginally better than chance. Further, we explore the
theoretical upper bound of MI by probing the Bayes Optimality within the VLM's
embedding space and find the irreducible error rate remains high. Despite this
pessimistic outlook, we analyze why MI for VLMs is particularly challenging and
identify three practical scenarios--fine-tuning, access to ground-truth texts,
and set-based inference--where auditing becomes feasible. Our study presents a
systematic view of the limits and opportunities of MI for VLMs, providing
guidance for future efforts in trustworthy data auditing.

Result: 原型模型在性能上与最先进的黑盒模型相当，同时具备内在可解释性。

Conclusion: 原型学习是提升人机交互信任和安全性的有前景的方法。

Abstract: Robotic agents need to understand how to interact with objects in their
environment, both autonomously and during human-robot interactions. Affordance
detection on 3D point clouds, which identifies object regions that allow
specific interactions, has traditionally relied on deep learning models like
PointNet++, DGCNN, or PointTransformerV3. However, these models operate as
black boxes, offering no insight into their decision-making processes.
Prototypical Learning methods, such as ProtoPNet, provide an interpretable
alternative to black-box models by employing a "this looks like that"
case-based reasoning approach. However, they have been primarily applied to
image-based tasks. In this work, we apply prototypical learning to models for
affordance detection on 3D point clouds. Experiments on the 3D-AffordanceNet
benchmark dataset show that prototypical models achieve competitive performance
with state-of-the-art black-box models and offer inherent interpretability.
This makes prototypical models a promising candidate for human-robot
interaction scenarios that require increased trust and safety.

eliminating barriers to arbitrary manipulation and editing, raising concerns
about multimedia authenticity and cybersecurity. However, existing Image
Manipulation Detection and Localization (IMDL) methodologies predominantly
focus on splicing or copy-move forgeries, lacking dedicated benchmarks for
inpainting-based manipulations. To bridge this gap, we present COCOInpaint, a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for inpainting detection, with
three key contributions: 1) High-quality inpainting samples generated by six
state-of-the-art inpainting models, 2) Diverse generation scenarios enabled by
four mask generation strategies with optional text guidance, and 3) Large-scale
coverage with 258,266 inpainted images with rich semantic diversity. Our
benchmark is constructed to emphasize intrinsic inconsistencies between
inpainted and authentic regions, rather than superficial semantic artifacts
such as object shapes. We establish a rigorous evaluation protocol using three
standard metrics to assess existing IMDL approaches. The dataset will be made
publicly available to facilitate future research in this area.

*Tiankai Hang,Jianmin Bao,Fangyun Wei,Dong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: FAR模型通过替换MAR的扩散头为轻量级快捷头，实现了高效采样，同时保持自回归原则，显著提升了推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在连续域图像生成中面临计算成本高和推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 提出FAR框架，用轻量级快捷头替代MAR的扩散头，实现高效采样，并与因果Transformer无缝集成。

Result: FAR推理速度比MAR快2.3倍，同时保持竞争力的FID和IS分数。

Conclusion: FAR为高质量连续空间图像生成建立了首个高效自回归范式，填补了视觉自回归建模中质量与可扩展性的关键差距。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have demonstrated remarkable success in sequential data
generation, particularly in NLP, but their extension to continuous-domain image
generation presents significant challenges. Recent work, the masked
autoregressive model (MAR), bypasses quantization by modeling per-token
distributions in continuous spaces using a diffusion head but suffers from slow
inference due to the high computational cost of the iterative denoising
process. To address this, we propose the Fast AutoRegressive model (FAR), a
novel framework that replaces MAR's diffusion head with a lightweight shortcut
head, enabling efficient few-step sampling while preserving autoregressive
principles. Additionally, FAR seamlessly integrates with causal Transformers,
extending them from discrete to continuous token generation without requiring
architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that FAR achieves
$2.3\times$ faster inference than MAR while maintaining competitive FID and IS
scores. This work establishes the first efficient autoregressive paradigm for
high-fidelity continuous-space image generation, bridging the critical gap
between quality and scalability in visual autoregressive modeling.

*Kesen Zhao,Beier Zhu,Qianru Sun,Hanwang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种无监督视觉链式思维（UV-CoT）框架，通过偏好优化实现图像级推理，无需边界框标注，显著提升了模型在视觉理解任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有链式思维方法主要基于文本，忽略了视觉线索的利用。视觉链式思维研究不足，且依赖大量标注数据，难以泛化。

Method: UV-CoT通过偏好比较模型生成的边界框，利用自动数据生成管道获取偏好数据，并通过优化负对数似然损失训练模型。

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明UV-CoT优于现有文本和视觉链式思维方法，且在四个未见数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: UV-CoT通过模拟人类感知（识别关键区域并基于其推理），显著提升了视觉理解能力，尤其在空间推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning greatly improves the interpretability and
problem-solving abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
existing approaches are focused on text CoT, limiting their ability to leverage
visual cues. Visual CoT remains underexplored, and the only work is based on
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) that relies on extensive labeled bounding-box data
and is hard to generalize to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce
Unsupervised Visual CoT (UV-CoT), a novel framework for image-level CoT
reasoning via preference optimization. UV-CoT performs preference comparisons
between model-generated bounding boxes (one is preferred and the other is
dis-preferred), eliminating the need for bounding-box annotations. We get such
preference data by introducing an automatic data generation pipeline. Given an
image, our target MLLM (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B) generates seed bounding boxes using
a template prompt and then answers the question using each bounded region as
input. An evaluator MLLM (e.g., OmniLLM-12B) ranks the responses, and these
rankings serve as supervision to train the target MLLM with UV-CoT by
minimizing negative log-likelihood losses. By emulating human
perception--identifying key regions and reasoning based on them--UV-CoT can
improve visual comprehension, particularly in spatial reasoning tasks where
textual descriptions alone fall short. Our experiments on six datasets
demonstrate the superiority of UV-CoT, compared to the state-of-the-art textual
and visual CoT methods. Our zero-shot testing on four unseen datasets shows the
strong generalization of UV-CoT. The code is available in
https://github.com/kesenzhao/UV-CoT.

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中表现优异，尤其是对行人和骑行者的检测有明显提升。

Conclusion: 该方法灵活可扩展，适用于任何单模态检测器，显著提升了多模态3D物体检测的性能。

Abstract: We present a new way to detect 3D objects from multimodal inputs, leveraging
both LiDAR and RGB cameras in a hybrid late-cascade scheme, that combines an
RGB detection network and a 3D LiDAR detector. We exploit late fusion
principles to reduce LiDAR False Positives, matching LiDAR detections with RGB
ones by projecting the LiDAR bounding boxes on the image. We rely on cascade
fusion principles to recover LiDAR False Negatives leveraging epipolar
constraints and frustums generated by RGB detections of separate views. Our
solution can be plugged on top of any underlying single-modal detectors,
enabling a flexible training process that can take advantage of pre-trained
LiDAR and RGB detectors, or train the two branches separately. We evaluate our
results on the KITTI object detection benchmark, showing significant
performance improvements, especially for the detection of Pedestrians and
Cyclists.

TLDR: LaRI是一种新的单图像几何推理方法，通过分层点图建模相机光线相交的多个表面，实现高效、完整的几何推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度估计仅局限于可见表面，LaRI旨在解决这一限制，实现更全面的几何推理。

Method: 使用分层点图建模光线相交的多个表面，并预测光线停止索引以识别有效像素和层。

Result: LaRI在对象级任务中仅用4%的训练数据和17%的参数达到可比性能，在场景级任务中仅需一次前向推理。

Conclusion: LaRI是一种通用且高效的几何推理方法，适用于对象和场景级任务。

Abstract: We present layered ray intersections (LaRI), a new method for unseen geometry
reasoning from a single image. Unlike conventional depth estimation that is
limited to the visible surface, LaRI models multiple surfaces intersected by
the camera rays using layered point maps. Benefiting from the compact and
layered representation, LaRI enables complete, efficient, and view-aligned
geometric reasoning to unify object- and scene-level tasks. We further propose
to predict the ray stopping index, which identifies valid intersecting pixels
and layers from LaRI's output. We build a complete training data generation
pipeline for synthetic and real-world data, including 3D objects and scenes,
with necessary data cleaning steps and coordination between rendering engines.
As a generic method, LaRI's performance is validated in two scenarios: It
yields comparable object-level results to the recent large generative model
using 4% of its training data and 17% of its parameters. Meanwhile, it achieves
scene-level occluded geometry reasoning in only one feed-forward.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于事件相机的迭代运动分割方法，通过将事件分类为背景和前景，扩展了对比度最大化框架，显著提升了运动目标检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机能够捕捉场景变化，但需要将事件数据分类为不同运动以实现运动分割，这对目标检测等任务至关重要。

Method: 采用迭代运动分割方法，将事件分类为背景（主导运动假设）和前景（独立运动残差），扩展了对比度最大化框架。

Result: 在公开和自录数据集上成功分类事件簇，生成清晰的运动补偿边缘图像，运动目标检测准确率提升30%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了对比度最大化框架的敏感性，为事件驱动的运动分割理论提供了新进展。

Abstract: Event cameras provide rich signals that are suitable for motion estimation
since they respond to changes in the scene. As any visual changes in the scene
produce event data, it is paramount to classify the data into different motions
(i.e., motion segmentation), which is useful for various tasks such as object
detection and visual servoing. We propose an iterative motion segmentation
method, by classifying events into background (e.g., dominant motion
hypothesis) and foreground (independent motion residuals), thus extending the
Contrast Maximization framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method successfully classifies event clusters both for public and
self-recorded datasets, producing sharp, motion-compensated edge-like images.
The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on moving object
detection benchmarks with an improvement of over 30%, and demonstrates its
possibility of applying to more complex and noisy real-world scenes. We hope
this work broadens the sensitivity of Contrast Maximization with respect to
both motion parameters and input events, thus contributing to theoretical
advancements in event-based motion segmentation estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出NoiseController方法，通过多级噪声分解、多帧噪声协作和联合去噪，提升视频生成的时空一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量视频生成对电影和自动驾驶等领域至关重要，但现有方法常忽视全局时空信息，导致时空一致性不足。

Method: NoiseController包含多级噪声分解（场景级和个体级噪声）、多帧噪声协作（跨视图和跨帧矩阵）和联合去噪（并行U-Net）。

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了NoiseController的先进性能。

Conclusion: NoiseController通过全局时空信息建模，显著提升了视频生成的时空一致性。

Abstract: High-quality video generation is crucial for many fields, including the film
industry and autonomous driving. However, generating videos with spatiotemporal
consistencies remains challenging. Current methods typically utilize attention
mechanisms or modify noise to achieve consistent videos, neglecting global
spatiotemporal information that could help ensure spatial and temporal
consistency during video generation. In this paper, we propose the
NoiseController, consisting of Multi-Level Noise Decomposition, Multi-Frame
Noise Collaboration, and Joint Denoising, to enhance spatiotemporal
consistencies in video generation. In multi-level noise decomposition, we first
decompose initial noises into scene-level foreground/background noises,
capturing distinct motion properties to model multi-view foreground/background
variations. Furthermore, each scene-level noise is further decomposed into
individual-level shared and residual components. The shared noise preserves
consistency, while the residual component maintains diversity. In multi-frame
noise collaboration, we introduce an inter-view spatiotemporal collaboration
matrix and an intra-view impact collaboration matrix , which captures mutual
cross-view effects and historical cross-frame impacts to enhance video quality.
The joint denoising contains two parallel denoising U-Nets to remove each
scene-level noise, mutually enhancing video generation. We evaluate our
NoiseController on public datasets focusing on video generation and downstream
tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有方法（如NeRF和3D高斯泼溅）在处理视角依赖效果时表现不佳，RGS-DR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RGS-DR采用2D高斯面元表示来准确估计几何和表面法线，并通过可学习的基元显式建模几何和材质属性，使用多级立方体mipmap近似环境光照积分。

Result: 实验表明，RGS-DR在光泽物体的高质量重建和渲染方面表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RGS-DR在逆渲染领域实现了高质量的重建和渲染效果，尤其在处理光泽和反射物体时具有显著优势。

Abstract: We introduce RGS-DR, a novel inverse rendering method for reconstructing and
rendering glossy and reflective objects with support for flexible relighting
and scene editing. Unlike existing methods (e.g., NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting), which struggle with view-dependent effects, RGS-DR utilizes a 2D
Gaussian surfel representation to accurately estimate geometry and surface
normals, an essential property for high-quality inverse rendering. Our approach
explicitly models geometric and material properties through learnable
primitives rasterized into a deferred shading pipeline, effectively reducing
rendering artifacts and preserving sharp reflections. By employing a
multi-level cube mipmap, RGS-DR accurately approximates environment lighting
integrals, facilitating high-quality reconstruction and relighting. A residual
pass with spherical-mipmap-based directional encoding further refines the
appearance modeling. Experiments demonstrate that RGS-DR achieves high-quality
reconstruction and rendering quality for shiny objects, often outperforming
reconstruction-exclusive state-of-the-art methods incapable of relighting.

Motivation: 准确预测路面状况指数（PCI）对基础设施维护至关重要，但现有方法预测精度不足。

Method: 采用改进的ResNet50架构，集成CBAM模块，自主优先提取关键特征。

Result: 改进后的ResNet50-CBAM模型MAPE为58.16%，优于基线模型的70.76%和65.48%。

Conclusion: 注意力机制能显著提升路面状况预测精度，为自动化路面分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the Pavement Condition Index (PCI), a measure of
roadway conditions, from pavement images is crucial for infrastructure
maintenance. This study proposes an enhanced version of the Residual Network
(ResNet50) architecture, integrated with a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM), to predict PCI directly from pavement images without additional
annotations. By incorporating CBAM, the model autonomously prioritizes critical
features within the images, improving prediction accuracy. Compared to the
original baseline ResNet50 and DenseNet161 architectures, the enhanced
ResNet50-CBAM model achieved a significantly lower mean absolute percentage
error (MAPE) of 58.16%, compared to the baseline models that achieved 70.76%
and 65.48% respectively. These results highlight the potential of using
attention mechanisms to refine feature extraction, ultimately enabling more
accurate and efficient assessments of pavement conditions. This study
emphasizes the importance of targeted feature refinement in advancing automated
pavement analysis through attention mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D评估指标常忽略几何质量或依赖黑盒模型，需更可靠的评估工具。

Method: 利用多种基础模型和工具作为探针，测量3D资产在不同方面的一致性。

Result: Eval3D提供像素级测量、准确空间反馈，更贴近人类判断。

Conclusion: Eval3D揭示了当前3D生成模型的局限性和挑战。

Abstract: Despite the unprecedented progress in the field of 3D generation, current
systems still often fail to produce high-quality 3D assets that are visually
appealing and geometrically and semantically consistent across multiple
viewpoints. To effectively assess the quality of the generated 3D data, there
is a need for a reliable 3D evaluation tool. Unfortunately, existing 3D
evaluation metrics often overlook the geometric quality of generated assets or
merely rely on black-box multimodal large language models for coarse
assessment. In this paper, we introduce Eval3D, a fine-grained, interpretable
evaluation tool that can faithfully evaluate the quality of generated 3D assets
based on various distinct yet complementary criteria. Our key observation is
that many desired properties of 3D generation, such as semantic and geometric
consistency, can be effectively captured by measuring the consistency among
various foundation models and tools. We thus leverage a diverse set of models
and tools as probes to evaluate the inconsistency of generated 3D assets across
different aspects. Compared to prior work, Eval3D provides pixel-wise
measurement, enables accurate 3D spatial feedback, and aligns more closely with
human judgments. We comprehensively evaluate existing 3D generation models
using Eval3D and highlight the limitations and challenges of current models.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在计算机视觉中广泛应用，但现有模糊鲁棒性评估过于简化，忽略了真实光学系统的模糊效应。

Method: 提出两个数据集：OpticsBench（基于Zernike多项式模拟主像差）和LensCorruptions（模拟100种真实镜头的模糊效应）。

Result: 在ImageNet和MSCOCO上的实验表明，不同预训练模型在数据集上性能差异显著。

Conclusion: 需考虑真实图像模糊效应以全面评估模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven to be successful in various computer
vision applications such that models even infer in safety-critical situations.
Therefore, vision models have to behave in a robust way to disturbances such as
noise or blur. While seminal benchmarks exist to evaluate model robustness to
diverse corruptions, blur is often approximated in an overly simplistic way to
model defocus, while ignoring the different blur kernel shapes that result from
optical systems. To study model robustness against realistic optical blur
effects, this paper proposes two datasets of blur corruptions, which we denote
OpticsBench and LensCorruptions. OpticsBench examines primary aberrations such
as coma, defocus, and astigmatism, i.e. aberrations that can be represented by
varying a single parameter of Zernike polynomials. To go beyond the principled
but synthetic setting of primary aberrations, LensCorruptions samples linear
combinations in the vector space spanned by Zernike polynomials, corresponding
to 100 real lenses. Evaluations for image classification and object detection
on ImageNet and MSCOCO show that for a variety of different pre-trained models,
the performance on OpticsBench and LensCorruptions varies significantly,
indicating the need to consider realistic image corruptions to evaluate a
model's robustness against blur.

Conclusion: 该数据集为事件相机在移动设备上的应用提供了基准，有望推动其更广泛的应用。

Abstract: Optical communication using modulated LEDs (e.g., visible light
communication) is an emerging application for event cameras, thanks to their
high spatio-temporal resolutions. Event cameras can be used simply to decode
the LED signals and also to localize the camera relative to the LED marker
positions. However, there is no public dataset to benchmark the decoding and
localization in various real-world settings. We present, to the best of our
knowledge, the first public dataset that consists of an event camera, a frame
camera, and ground-truth poses that are precisely synchronized with hardware
triggers. It provides various camera motions with various sensitivities in
different scene brightness settings, both indoor and outdoor. Furthermore, we
propose a novel method of localization that leverages the Contrast Maximization
framework for motion estimation and compensation. The detailed analysis and
experimental results demonstrate the advantages of LED-based localization with
events over the conventional AR-marker--based one with frames, as well as the
efficacy of the proposed method in localization. We hope that the proposed
dataset serves as a future benchmark for both motion-related classical computer
vision tasks and LED marker decoding tasks simultaneously, paving the way to
broadening applications of event cameras on mobile devices.

Motivation: 超分辨率问题本质上是病态的，传统方法倾向于生成模糊图像，而人类更偏好高质量的样本。论文旨在通过NR-IQA模型优化SR结果，使其更符合人类感知。

Method: 论文分析了NR-IQA指标在人类数据上的表现，并提出了两种应用方法：(i) 通过多真实值框架调整数据采样，(ii) 直接优化可微分质量分数。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在感知与失真之间取得了更符合人类偏好的平衡，减少了非感知像素级失真的影响。

Conclusion: 通过NR-IQA模型优化SR学习，能够生成更符合人类感知的高质量图像，为SR任务提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR), a classical inverse problem in computer vision, is
inherently ill-posed, inducing a distribution of plausible solutions for every
input. However, the desired result is not simply the expectation of this
distribution, which is the blurry image obtained by minimizing pixelwise error,
but rather the sample with the highest image quality. A variety of techniques,
from perceptual metrics to adversarial losses, are employed to this end. In
this work, we explore an alternative: utilizing powerful non-reference image
quality assessment (NR-IQA) models in the SR context. We begin with a
comprehensive analysis of NR-IQA metrics on human-derived SR data, identifying
both the accuracy (human alignment) and complementarity of different metrics.
Then, we explore two methods of applying NR-IQA models to SR learning: (i)
altering data sampling, by building on an existing multi-ground-truth SR
framework, and (ii) directly optimizing a differentiable quality score. Our
results demonstrate a more human-centric perception-distortion tradeoff,
focusing less on non-perceptual pixel-wise distortion, instead improving the
balance between perceptual fidelity and human-tuned NR-IQA measures.

Abstract: Speech production is a complex sequential process which involve the
coordination of various articulatory features. Among them tongue being a highly
versatile active articulator responsible for shaping airflow to produce
targeted speech sounds that are intellectual, clear, and distinct. This paper
presents a novel approach for predicting tongue and lip articulatory features
involved in a given speech acoustics using a stacked Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architecture, combined with a one-dimensional
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for post-processing with fixed weights
initialization. The proposed network is trained with two datasets consisting of
simultaneously recorded speech and Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA)
datasets, each introducing variations in terms of geographical origin,
linguistic characteristics, phonetic diversity, and recording equipment. The
performance of the model is assessed in Speaker Dependent (SD), Speaker

Experimental results indicate that the proposed model with fixed weights
approach outperformed the adaptive weights initialization with in relatively
minimal number of training epochs. These findings contribute to the development
of robust and efficient models for articulatory feature prediction, paving the
way for advancements in speech production research and applications.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Graphical User

performance, leaving privacy and security assessments largely unexplored. We
review current evaluation metrics for both GUI and general LLM agents and
outline five key challenges in integrating human evaluators for GUI agent
assessments. To address these gaps, we advocate for a human-centered evaluation
framework that incorporates risk assessments, enhances user awareness through
in-context consent, and embeds privacy and security considerations into GUI

Result: DiffUMI在隐私保护面部识别系统中实现高效高保真重构，并首次利用反演检测非面部输入。

Conclusion: DiffUMI展示了扩散模型在反演攻击中的潜力，为评估面部识别隐私风险提供了新工具。

Abstract: Facial recognition technology poses significant privacy risks, as it relies
on biometric data that is inherently sensitive and immutable if compromised. To
mitigate these concerns, face recognition systems convert raw images into
embeddings, traditionally considered privacy-preserving. However, model
inversion attacks pose a significant privacy threat by reconstructing these
private facial images, making them a crucial tool for evaluating the privacy
risks of face recognition systems. Existing methods usually require training
individual generators for each target model, a computationally expensive
process. In this paper, we propose DiffUMI, a training-free diffusion-driven
universal model inversion attack for face recognition systems. DiffUMI is the
first approach to apply a diffusion model for unconditional image generation in
model inversion. Unlike other methods, DiffUMI is universal, eliminating the
need for training target-specific generators. It operates within a fixed
framework and pretrained diffusion model while seamlessly adapting to diverse
target identities and models. DiffUMI breaches privacy-preserving face
recognition systems with state-of-the-art success, demonstrating that an
unconditional diffusion model, coupled with optimized adversarial search,
enables efficient and high-fidelity facial reconstruction. Additionally, we
introduce a novel application of out-of-domain detection (OODD), marking the
first use of model inversion to distinguish non-face inputs from face inputs
based solely on embeddings.

### [107] [iVR-GS: Inverse Volume Rendering for Explorable Visualization via Editable 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17954)
*Kaiyuan Tang,Siyuan Yao,Chaoli Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于高斯泼溅的逆体积渲染方法（iVR-GS），用于降低渲染成本并支持交互式体积探索，解决了现有方法在场景编辑和可见性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新颖视图合成（NVS）方法虽然渲染速度快且硬件要求低，但场景的可见部分受预设传输函数（TF）限制，无法满足用户交互式探索的需求。

Method: 通过组合多个与基本TF关联的iVR-GS模型，覆盖场景的不同可见部分，每个模型包含可编辑的3D高斯点，支持实时渲染和编辑。

Result: iVR-GS在多个体积数据集上展示了优于其他NVS方法（如Plenoxels、CCNeRF和基础3DGS）的重建质量和可组合性。

Conclusion: iVR-GS是一种高效的NVS方法，能够在降低渲染成本的同时实现交互式体积探索，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In volume visualization, users can interactively explore the
three-dimensional data by specifying color and opacity mappings in the transfer
function (TF) or adjusting lighting parameters, facilitating meaningful
interpretation of the underlying structure. However, rendering large-scale
volumes demands powerful GPUs and high-speed memory access for real-time
performance. While existing novel view synthesis (NVS) methods offer faster
rendering speeds with lower hardware requirements, the visible parts of a
reconstructed scene are fixed and constrained by preset TF settings,
significantly limiting user exploration. This paper introduces inverse volume
rendering via Gaussian splatting (iVR-GS), an innovative NVS method that
reduces the rendering cost while enabling scene editing for interactive volume
exploration. Specifically, we compose multiple iVR-GS models associated with
basic TFs covering disjoint visible parts to make the entire volumetric scene
visible. Each basic model contains a collection of 3D editable Gaussians, where
each Gaussian is a 3D spatial point that supports real-time scene rendering and
editing. We demonstrate the superior reconstruction quality and composability
of iVR-GS against other NVS solutions (Plenoxels, CCNeRF, and base 3DGS) on
various volume datasets. The code is available at

Main category: math.NA

TLDR: 本文提出了一种自引导数据增强方法，通过自适应加权抑制异常值影响，将TRPCA问题转化为标准TPCA问题，提高了处理结构化噪声的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TRPCA方法依赖稀疏异常假设，难以处理结构化噪声，因此需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 采用自引导数据增强和自适应加权策略，提出基于优化驱动的加权方案，并开发了高效的近端块坐标下降算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实数据集（如人脸恢复、背景减除和高光谱去噪）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和计算效率上均有显著提升，适用于多种噪声模式。

Abstract: Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis (TRPCA) is a fundamental technique
for decomposing multi-dimensional data into a low-rank tensor and an outlier
tensor, yet existing methods relying on sparse outlier assumptions often fail
under structured corruptions. In this paper, we propose a self-guided data
augmentation approach that employs adaptive weighting to suppress outlier
influence, reformulating the original TRPCA problem into a standard Tensor
Principal Component Analysis (TPCA) problem. The proposed model involves an
optimization-driven weighting scheme that dynamically identifies and
downweights outlier contributions during tensor augmentation. We develop an
efficient proximal block coordinate descent algorithm with closed-form updates
to solve the resulting optimization problem, ensuring computational efficiency.
Theoretical convergence is guaranteed through a framework combining block
coordinate descent with majorization-minimization principles. Numerical
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including face recovery,
background subtraction, and hyperspectral denoising, demonstrate that our
method effectively handles various corruption patterns. The results show the
improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 探索LLM如何适应性地协作完成复杂具身推理任务，以推动多智能体协作技术的发展。

Method: 开发了MINDcraft平台和MineCollab基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在Minecraft中的协作表现。

Result: 实验显示，当前LLM代理在详细任务计划沟通时性能下降15%，表明自然语言沟通是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 现有LLM代理在多智能体协作中表现不佳，需探索超越上下文和模仿学习的方法。

Abstract: Collaboration is ubiquitous and essential in day-to-day life -- from
exchanging ideas, to delegating tasks, to generating plans together. This work
studies how LLMs can adaptively collaborate to perform complex embodied
reasoning tasks. To this end we introduce MINDcraft, an easily extensible
platform built to enable LLM agents to control characters in the open-world
game of Minecraft; and MineCollab, a benchmark to test the different dimensions
of embodied and collaborative reasoning. An experimental study finds that the
primary bottleneck in collaborating effectively for current state-of-the-art
agents is efficient natural language communication, with agent performance
dropping as much as 15% when they are required to communicate detailed task
completion plans. We conclude that existing LLM agents are ill-optimized for
multi-agent collaboration, especially in embodied scenarios, and highlight the
need to employ methods beyond in-context and imitation learning. Our website

Motivation: 解决无人商店中隐藏物品（如放在背包或口袋中）导致的盗窃问题，利用现有RFID基础设施提升防盗能力。

Method: 通过分析RF信号的RSSI和相位角，训练神经网络分类七种常见容器；结合距离测量优化准确性。

Conclusion: 该系统结合材料识别与计算机视觉，利用现有基础设施实现了无人商店的主动防盗，可实时标记可疑行为。

Abstract: Cashierless stores rely on computer vision and RFID tags to associate
shoppers with items, but concealed items placed in backpacks, pockets, or bags
create challenges for theft prevention. We introduce a system that turns
existing RFID tagged items into material sensors by exploiting how different
containers attenuate and scatter RF signals. Using RSSI and phase angle, we
trained a neural network to classify seven common containers. In a simulated
retail environment, the model achieves 89% accuracy with one second samples and
74% accuracy from single reads. Incorporating distance measurements, our system
achieves 82% accuracy across 0.3-2m tag to reader separations. When deployed at
aisle or doorway choke points, the system can flag suspicious events in real
time, prompting camera screening or staff intervention. By combining material
identification with computer vision tracking, our system provides proactive
loss prevention for cashierless retail while utilizing existing infrastructure.

TLDR: 论文探讨了激活函数与样条回归/平滑的联系，分析了其对1D浅层网络频谱偏置的影响，并将梯度下降重新解释为一种收缩算子，通过超参数控制频谱偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究激活函数选择如何影响神经网络的频谱偏置，并探索梯度下降在调节频谱偏置中的作用。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，将梯度下降视为收缩算子，研究其超参数与频谱偏置的关系。

Result: 梯度下降通过超参数隐式选择保留的频率分量，且仅对单调激活函数有效；非单调激活函数可作为频谱偏置的高效替代。

Conclusion: 激活函数的选择和梯度下降超参数对频谱偏置有显著影响，非单调激活函数在迭代效率上具有优势。

Abstract: We generalize the connection between activation function and spline
regression/smoothing and characterize how this choice may influence spectral
bias within a 1D shallow network. We then demonstrate how gradient descent (GD)
can be reinterpreted as a shrinkage operator that masks the singular values of
a neural network's Jacobian. Viewed this way, GD implicitly selects the number
of frequency components to retain, thereby controlling the spectral bias. An
explicit relationship is proposed between the choice of GD hyperparameters
(learning rate & number of iterations) and bandwidth (the number of active
components). GD regularization is shown to be effective only with monotonic
activation functions. Finally, we highlight the utility of non-monotonic
activation functions (sinc, Gaussian) as iteration-efficient surrogates for
spectral bias.

Abstract: This paper concerns corpus poisoning attacks in dense information retrieval,
where an adversary attempts to compromise the ranking performance of a search
algorithm by injecting a small number of maliciously generated documents into
the corpus. Our work addresses two limitations in the current literature.
First, attacks that perform adversarial gradient-based word substitution search
do so in the discrete lexical space, while retrieval itself happens in the
continuous embedding space. We thus propose an optimization method that
operates in the embedding space directly. Specifically, we train a perturbation
model with the objective of maintaining the geometric distance between the
original and adversarial document embeddings, while also maximizing the
token-level dissimilarity between the original and adversarial documents.
Second, it is common for related work to have a strong assumption that the
adversary has prior knowledge about the queries. In this paper, we focus on a
more challenging variant of the problem where the adversary assumes no prior
knowledge about the query distribution (hence, unsupervised). Our core
contribution is an adversarial corpus attack that is fast and effective. We
present comprehensive experimental results on both in- and out-of-domain
datasets, focusing on two related tasks: a top-1 attack and a corpus poisoning
attack. We consider attacks under both a white-box and a black-box setting.
Notably, our method can generate successful adversarial examples in under two
minutes per target document; four times faster compared to the fastest
gradient-based word substitution methods in the literature with the same
hardware. Furthermore, our adversarial generation method generates text that is
more likely to occur under the distribution of natural text (low perplexity),
and is therefore more difficult to detect.

Conclusion: 该模型可作为医学图像分类中传统深度学习方法的替代方案。

Abstract: The Computer_Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems facilitate accurate diagnosis of
diseases. The development of CADs by leveraging third generation neural
network, namely, Spiking Neural Network (SNN), is essential to utilize of the
benefits of SNNs, such as their event_driven processing, parallelism, low power
consumption, and the ability to process sparse temporal_spatial information.
However, Deep SNN as a deep learning model faces challenges with unreliability.
To deal with unreliability challenges due to inability to quantify the
uncertainty of the predictions, we proposed a deep Bayesian Convolutional
Spiking Neural Network based_CADs with uncertainty_aware module. In this study,
the Monte Carlo Dropout method as Bayesian approximation is used as an
uncertainty quantification method. This method was applied to several medical
image classification tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed model is accurate and reliable and will be a proper alternative to
conventional deep learning for medical image classification.

Conclusion: 深度学习可自动化牛犊体重预测，提升农场管理效率。

Abstract: Monitoring calf body weight (BW) before weaning is essential for assessing
growth, feed efficiency, health, and weaning readiness. However, labor, time,
and facility constraints limit BW collection. Additionally, Holstein calf coat
patterns complicate image-based BW estimation, and few studies have explored
non-contact measurements taken at early time points for predicting later BW.
The objectives of this study were to (1) develop deep learning-based
segmentation models for extracting calf body metrics, (2) compare deep learning
segmentation with threshold-based methods, and (3) evaluate BW prediction using
single-time-point cross-validation with linear regression (LR) and extreme
gradient boosting (XGBoost) and multiple-time-point cross-validation with LR,
XGBoost, and a linear mixed model (LMM). Depth images from Holstein (n = 63)
and Jersey (n = 5) pre-weaning calves were collected, with 20 Holstein calves
being weighed manually. Results showed that You Only Look Once version 8
(YOLOv8) deep learning segmentation (intersection over union = 0.98)
outperformed threshold-based methods (0.89). In single-time-point
cross-validation, XGBoost achieved the best BW prediction (R^2 = 0.91, mean
absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 4.37%), while LMM provided the most accurate
longitudinal BW prediction (R^2 = 0.99, MAPE = 2.39%). These findings highlight
the potential of deep learning for automated BW prediction, enhancing farm
management.

Abstract: Accurate myocardial image registration is essential for cardiac strain
analysis and disease diagnosis. However, spectral bias in neural networks
impedes modeling high-frequency deformations, producing inaccurate,
biomechanically implausible results, particularly in pathological data. This
paper addresses spectral bias in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by
integrating Fourier Feature mappings and introducing modulation strategies into
a PINN framework. Experiments on two distinct datasets demonstrate that the
proposed methods enhance the PINN's ability to capture complex, high-frequency
deformations in cardiomyopathies, achieving superior registration accuracy
while maintaining biomechanical plausibility - thus providing a foundation for
scalable cardiac image registration and generalization across multiple patients
and pathologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EIT在医学和工业中有广泛应用，但面临逆问题的不适定性和灵敏度分布不均的挑战。传统方法未能同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 提出PhyNC（Physics-driven Neural Compensation），一种无监督深度学习框架，动态分配神经表示能力至低灵敏度区域。

Result: 在模拟和实验数据上，PhyNC在细节保留和抗伪影方面优于现有方法，尤其在低灵敏度区域表现突出。

Conclusion: PhyNC提升了EIT重建的鲁棒性，并为其他类似成像模态提供了灵活框架。

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) provides a non-invasive, portable
imaging modality with significant potential in medical and industrial
applications. Despite its advantages, EIT encounters two primary challenges:
the ill-posed nature of its inverse problem and the spatially variable,
location-dependent sensitivity distribution. Traditional model-based methods
mitigate ill-posedness through regularization but overlook sensitivity
variability, while supervised deep learning approaches require extensive
training data and lack generalization. Recent developments in neural fields
have introduced implicit regularization techniques for image reconstruction,
but these methods typically neglect the physical principles underlying EIT,
thus limiting their effectiveness. In this study, we propose PhyNC
(Physics-driven Neural Compensation), an unsupervised deep learning framework
that incorporates the physical principles of EIT. PhyNC addresses both the
ill-posed inverse problem and the sensitivity distribution by dynamically
allocating neural representational capacity to regions with lower sensitivity,
ensuring accurate and balanced conductivity reconstructions. Extensive
evaluations on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that PhyNC
outperforms existing methods in terms of detail preservation and artifact
resistance, particularly in low-sensitivity regions. Our approach enhances the
robustness of EIT reconstructions and provides a flexible framework that can be
adapted to other imaging modalities with similar challenges.

survival rate of 6.9%. Treatment typically involves surgery, followed by
radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and frequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scans to monitor disease progression. To assess treatment response,
radiologists use the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria to
categorize the tumor into one of four labels based on imaging and clinical
features: complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive
disease. This assessment is very complex and time-consuming. Since deep
learning (DL) has been widely used to tackle classification problems, this work
aimed to implement the first DL pipeline for the classification of RANO
criteria based on two consecutive MRI acquisitions. The models were trained and
tested on the open dataset LUMIERE. Five approaches were tested: 1) subtraction
of input images, 2) different combinations of modalities, 3) different model
architectures, 4) different pretraining tasks, and 5) adding clinical data. The
pipeline that achieved the best performance used a Densenet264 considering only
T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)
images as input without any pretraining. A median Balanced Accuracy of 50.96%
was achieved. Additionally, explainability methods were applied. Using Saliency
Maps, the tumor region was often successfully highlighted. In contrast,
Grad-CAM typically failed to highlight the tumor region, with some exceptions
observed in the Complete Response and Progressive Disease classes, where it
effectively identified the tumor region. These results set a benchmark for
future studies on glioblastoma treatment response assessment based on the RANO
criteria while emphasizing the heterogeneity of factors that might play a role
when assessing the tumor's response to treatment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统医学图像分割方法在高分辨率下内存需求大，而降低分辨率会导致细节丢失。

Method: 学习神经无符号距离场（NUDF）直接从图像中生成连续距离场，支持高分辨率处理和任意拓扑结构的3D网格建模。

Result: 在左心耳（LAA）分割任务中，NUDF方法能生成高精度3D网格模型，精度接近CT图像体素间距。

Conclusion: NUDF方法在医学图像分割中表现出色，尤其适用于复杂形状的高分辨率建模。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is often considered as the task of labelling each
pixel or voxel as being inside or outside a given anatomy. Processing the
images at their original size and resolution often result in insuperable memory
requirements, but downsampling the images leads to a loss of important details.
Instead of aiming to represent a smooth and continuous surface in a binary
voxel-grid, we propose to learn a Neural Unsigned Distance Field (NUDF)
directly from the image. The small memory requirements of NUDF allow for high
resolution processing, while the continuous nature of the distance field allows
us to create high resolution 3D mesh models of shapes of any topology (i.e.
open surfaces). We evaluate our method on the task of left atrial appendage
(LAA) segmentation from Computed Tomography (CT) images. The LAA is a complex
and highly variable shape, being thus difficult to represent with traditional
segmentation methods using discrete labelmaps. With our proposed method, we are
able to predict 3D mesh models that capture the details of the LAA and achieve
accuracy in the order of the voxel spacing in the CT images.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于分区图的快速块划分算法，用于VVC编码中的帧间编码，通过神经网络预测分区图，显著降低编码复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VVC编码中的QT+MTT块结构虽提供灵活划分，但递归搜索增加了编码复杂度，需高效解决方案。

Method: 改进分区图方法，引入MTT掩码；设计神经网络利用时空特征预测分区图；提出双阈值决策方案平衡复杂度与性能。

Result: 实验显示，编码时间平均减少51.30%，BDBR仅增加2.12%。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著降低复杂度的同时，保持了良好的率失真性能。

Abstract: Among the new techniques of Versatile Video Coding (VVC), the quadtree with
nested multi-type tree (QT+MTT) block structure yields significant coding gains
by providing more flexible block partitioning patterns. However, the recursive
partition search in the VVC encoder increases the encoder complexity
substantially. To address this issue, we propose a partition map-based
algorithm to pursue fast block partitioning in inter coding. Based on our
previous work on partition map-based methods for intra coding, we analyze the
characteristics of VVC inter coding, and thus improve the partition map by
incorporating an MTT mask for early termination. Next, we develop a neural
network that uses both spatial and temporal features to predict the partition
map. It consists of several special designs including stacked top-down and
bottom-up processing, quantization parameter modulation layers, and
partitioning-adaptive warping. Furthermore, we present a dual-threshold
decision scheme to achieve a fine-grained trade-off between complexity
reduction and rate-distortion (RD) performance loss. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average 51.30% encoding time
saving with a 2.12% Bjontegaard Delta Bit Rate (BDBR) under the random access
configuration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算白质纤维束形状测量的方法计算成本高且耗时，限制了大规模数据集的分析。

Method: 提出Tract2Shape框架，结合几何（点云）和标量（表格）特征，利用降维算法预测主要形状成分，并在HCP-YA和PPMI数据集上训练和评估。

Result: Tract2Shape在HCP-YA数据集上优于现有深度学习模型，并在未见过的PPMI数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Tract2Shape为未来大规模白质形状分析提供了高效、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Shape measures have emerged as promising descriptors of white matter
tractography, offering complementary insights into anatomical variability and
associations with cognitive and clinical phenotypes. However, conventional
methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and
time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based
representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning
framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features
to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model
efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to
predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on
two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset.
We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the
HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To
further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test
Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep
learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average
Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows
that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the
unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low
nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation.
Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white
matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis
across datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future
large-scale white matter shape analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少HBP图像的扫描时间，提高患者舒适度和扫描效率。

Method: 使用三种生成模型（U-Net、pGAN、DDPM）从早期对比阶段合成HBP图像，并引入CES评估数据质量。

Result: pGAN在定量评估中表现最佳，但U-Net在一致性上更优；DDPM表现较差。

Conclusion: 合成HBP图像可行，能减少扫描时间且不影响诊断效果，展示了深度学习在肝脏MRI中的临床潜力。

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays a
crucial role in the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions, with
the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) providing essential diagnostic information.
However, acquiring HBP images requires prolonged scan times, which may
compromise patient comfort and scanner throughput. In this study, we propose a
deep learning based approach for synthesizing HBP images from earlier contrast
phases (precontrast and transitional) and compare three generative models: a
perceptual U-Net, a perceptual GAN (pGAN), and a denoising diffusion
probabilistic model (DDPM). We curated a multi-site DCE-MRI dataset from
diverse clinical settings and introduced a contrast evolution score (CES) to
assess training data quality, enhancing model performance. Quantitative
evaluation using pixel-wise and perceptual metrics, combined with qualitative
assessment through blinded radiologist reviews, showed that pGAN achieved the
best quantitative performance but introduced heterogeneous contrast in
out-of-distribution cases. In contrast, the U-Net produced consistent liver
enhancement with fewer artifacts, while DDPM underperformed due to limited
preservation of fine structural details. These findings demonstrate the
feasibility of synthetic HBP image generation as a means to reduce scan time
without compromising diagnostic utility, highlighting the clinical potential of
deep learning for dynamic contrast enhancement in liver MRI. A project demo is

Abstract: Morphometry of medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions in brain MRI is
sensitive biomarker to Alzheimers Disease and other related conditions. While
T2-weighted (T2w) MRI with high in-plane resolution is widely used to segment
hippocampal subfields due to its higher contrast in hippocampus, its lower
out-of-plane resolution reduces the accuracy of subregion thickness
measurements. To address this issue, we developed a nearly isotropic
segmentation pipeline that incorporates image and label upsampling and
high-resolution segmentation in T2w MRI. First, a high-resolution atlas was
created based on an existing anisotropic atlas derived from 29 individuals.
Both T1-weighted and T2w images in the atlas were upsampled from their original
resolution to a nearly isotropic resolution 0.4x0.4x0.52mm3 using a non-local
means approach. Manual segmentations within the atlas were also upsampled to
match this resolution using a UNet-based neural network, which was trained on a
cohort consisting of both high-resolution ex vivo and low-resolution
anisotropic in vivo MRI with manual segmentations. Second, a multi-modality
deep learning-based segmentation model was trained within this nearly isotropic
atlas. Finally, experiments showed the nearly isotropic subregion segmentation
improved the accuracy of cortical thickness as an imaging biomarker for
neurodegeneration in T2w MRI.

Conclusion: RSFR具有鲁棒性、可扩展性和临床转化潜力，为心脏DTI的定量分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) offers unique insights into
cardiomyocyte arrangements, bridging the gap between microscopic and
macroscopic cardiac function. However, its clinical utility is limited by
technical challenges, including a low signal-to-noise ratio, aliasing
artefacts, and the need for accurate quantitative fidelity. To address these
limitations, we introduce RSFR (Reconstruction, Segmentation, Fusion &
Refinement), a novel framework for cardiac diffusion-weighted image
reconstruction. RSFR employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, leveraging zero-shot
semantic priors via the Segment Anything Model and a robust Vision Mamba-based
reconstruction backbone. Our framework integrates semantic features effectively
to mitigate artefacts and enhance fidelity, achieving state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and accurate DT parameter estimation under high
undersampling rates. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the
superior performance of RSFR compared to existing methods, highlighting its
robustness, scalability, and potential for clinical translation in quantitative
cardiac DTI.
