### [1] [Benchmarking Large Language Models for Calculus Problem-Solving: A Comparative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13187)
*In Hak Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该研究评估了五种大型语言模型（LLMs）在解决微积分微分问题上的表现，结果显示Chat GPT 4o表现最佳，但所有模型在概念理解和代数操作上存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在数学教育中的潜力，特别是在解决微积分问题上的能力，以揭示其优势和不足。

Method: 采用系统性交叉评估框架，让每个模型解决由所有模型生成的问题，涵盖13种基本问题类型。

Result: Chat GPT 4o成功率最高（94.71%），其次是Claude Pro（85.74%）、Gemini Advanced（84.42%）、Copilot Pro（76.30%）和Meta AI（56.75%）。模型在程序性任务上表现优异，但在概念性任务上表现不一。

Conclusion: LLMs在程序性任务上表现突出，但在概念理解上仍有局限，强调了人类教学在数学教育中的重要性。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of five leading large language
models (LLMs) - Chat GPT 4o, Copilot Pro, Gemini Advanced, Claude Pro, and Meta
AI - on their performance in solving calculus differentiation problems. The
investigation assessed these models across 13 fundamental problem types,
employing a systematic cross-evaluation framework where each model solved
problems generated by all models. Results revealed significant performance
disparities, with Chat GPT 4o achieving the highest success rate (94.71%),
followed by Claude Pro (85.74%), Gemini Advanced (84.42%), Copilot Pro
(76.30%), and Meta AI (56.75%). All models excelled at procedural
differentiation tasks but showed varying limitations with conceptual
understanding and algebraic manipulation. Notably, problems involving
increasing/decreasing intervals and optimization word problems proved most
challenging across all models. The cross-evaluation matrix revealed that Claude
Pro generated the most difficult problems, suggesting distinct capabilities
between problem generation and problem-solving. These findings have significant
implications for educational applications, highlighting both the potential and
limitations of LLMs as calculus learning tools. While they demonstrate
impressive procedural capabilities, their conceptual understanding remains
limited compared to human mathematical reasoning, emphasizing the continued
importance of human instruction for developing deeper mathematical
comprehension.

### [2] [BASIR: Budget-Assisted Sectoral Impact Ranking -- A Dataset for Sector Identification and Performance Prediction Using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13189)
*Sohom Ghosh,Sudip Kumar Naskar*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该研究提出了一种框架（BASIR），用于分析印度联邦预算对特定经济部门的影响，包括多标签分类和部门绩效排名，填补了实时预算影响分析的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政府财政政策（如年度预算）对金融市场有显著影响，但实时分析预算对部门股票表现的影响仍缺乏系统方法。

Method: 利用1947年至2025年印度联邦预算文本，构建BASIR数据集，结合微调嵌入和语言模型进行部门分类和绩效排名。

Result: 部门分类F1得分为0.605，绩效排名NDCG得分为0.997，表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为投资者和政策制定者提供了数据驱动的预算影响分析工具，并公开了数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Government fiscal policies, particularly annual union budgets, exert
significant influence on financial markets. However, real-time analysis of
budgetary impacts on sector-specific equity performance remains
methodologically challenging and largely unexplored. This study proposes a
framework to systematically identify and rank sectors poised to benefit from
India's Union Budget announcements. The framework addresses two core tasks: (1)
multi-label classification of excerpts from budget transcripts into 81
predefined economic sectors, and (2) performance ranking of these sectors.
Leveraging a comprehensive corpus of Indian Union Budget transcripts from 1947
to 2025, we introduce BASIR (Budget-Assisted Sectoral Impact Ranking), an
annotated dataset mapping excerpts from budgetary transcripts to sectoral
impacts. Our architecture incorporates fine-tuned embeddings for sector
identification, coupled with language models that rank sectors based on their
predicted performances. Our results demonstrate 0.605 F1-score in sector
classification, and 0.997 NDCG score in predicting ranks of sectors based on
post-budget performances. The methodology enables investors and policymakers to
quantify fiscal policy impacts through structured, data-driven insights,
addressing critical gaps in manual analysis. The annotated dataset has been
released under CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license to advance computational economics
research.

### [4] [Sustainability via LLM Right-sizing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13217)
*Jennifer Haase,Finn Klessascheck,Jan Mendling,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究评估了11种大型语言模型（LLMs）在10种日常职业任务中的表现，发现GPT-4o性能最优但成本高，而较小模型如Gemma-3和Phi-4在成本、本地部署和隐私方面更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在组织工作流程中的广泛应用，其能源消耗、财务成本和数据主权问题引发担忧。研究旨在探讨何时较小、本地可部署的模型能够满足需求。

Method: 采用双LLM评估框架，自动化任务执行并标准化评估10项标准，包括输出质量、事实准确性和伦理责任。

Result: GPT-4o表现最优但成本高，较小模型在多数任务中表现可靠。任务类型影响模型效果，概念性任务更具挑战性。

Conclusion: 建议从性能最大化转向任务和情境感知的充分性评估，以更符合组织需求，并提供可持续AI模型评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly embedded in
organizational workflows. This has raised concerns over their energy
consumption, financial costs, and data sovereignty. While performance
benchmarks often celebrate cutting-edge models, real-world deployment decisions
require a broader perspective: when is a smaller, locally deployable model
"good enough"? This study offers an empirical answer by evaluating eleven
proprietary and open-weight LLMs across ten everyday occupational tasks,
including summarizing texts, generating schedules, and drafting emails and
proposals. Using a dual-LLM-based evaluation framework, we automated task
execution and standardized evaluation across ten criteria related to output
quality, factual accuracy, and ethical responsibility. Results show that GPT-4o
delivers consistently superior performance but at a significantly higher cost
and environmental footprint. Notably, smaller models like Gemma-3 and Phi-4
achieved strong and reliable results on most tasks, suggesting their viability
in contexts requiring cost-efficiency, local deployment, or privacy. A cluster
analysis revealed three model groups -- premium all-rounders, competent
generalists, and limited but safe performers -- highlighting trade-offs between
quality, control, and sustainability. Significantly, task type influenced model
effectiveness: conceptual tasks challenged most models, while aggregation and
transformation tasks yielded better performances. We argue for a shift from
performance-maximizing benchmarks to task- and context-aware sufficiency
assessments that better reflect organizational priorities. Our approach
contributes a scalable method to evaluate AI models through a sustainability
lens and offers actionable guidance for responsible LLM deployment in practice.

### [5] [DIDS: Domain Impact-aware Data Sampling for Large Language Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13227)
*Weijie Shi,Jipeng Zhang,Yaguang Wu,Jingzhi Fang,Ruiyuan Zhang,Jiajie Xu,Jia Zhu,Hao Chen,Yao Zhao,Sirui Han,Xiaofang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: DIDS提出了一种基于领域影响感知的数据采样方法，通过梯度聚类和FIM度量优化领域采样策略，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域采样策略难以保持域内一致性和准确衡量领域影响，影响了模型性能。

Method: 提出梯度聚类算法分组数据，使用FIM度量量化领域影响，结合损失学习轨迹确定最优采样比例。

Result: 实验显示DIDS平均性能提升3.4%，同时保持训练效率。

Conclusion: DIDS有效优化了领域采样策略，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly trained on multi-domain datasets,
where domain sampling strategies significantly impact model performance due to
varying domain importance across downstream tasks. Existing approaches for
optimizing domain-level sampling strategies struggle with maintaining
intra-domain consistency and accurately measuring domain impact. In this paper,
we present Domain Impact-aware Data Sampling (DIDS). To ensure intra-domain
consistency, a gradient clustering algorithm is proposed to group training data
based on their learning effects, where a proxy language model and
dimensionality reduction are employed to reduce computational overhead. To
accurately measure domain impact, we develop a Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)
guided metric that quantifies how domain-specific parameter updates affect the
model's output distributions on downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees.
Furthermore, to determine optimal sampling ratios, DIDS combines both the
FIM-guided domain impact assessment and loss learning trajectories that
indicate domain-specific potential, while accounting for diminishing marginal
returns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIDS achieves 3.4% higher
average performance while maintaining comparable training efficiency.

### [6] [ImPart: Importance-Aware Delta-Sparsification for Improved Model Compression and Merging in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13237)
*Yan Yang,Yixia Li,Hongru Wang,Xuetao Wei,Jianqiao Yu,Yun Chen,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: ImPart是一种基于重要性感知的delta稀疏化方法，通过动态调整奇异向量的稀疏比，在高压缩比下保留关键任务知识，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有delta稀疏化方法忽略参数重要性或评估粒度不足的问题。

Method: 利用SVD动态调整不同奇异向量的稀疏比，基于其重要性。

Result: 在相同性能水平下，压缩比提高2倍，并在delta量化和模型合并中达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: ImPart为delta稀疏化提供了高效且重要性感知的解决方案，显著提升压缩性能。

Abstract: With the proliferation of task-specific large language models, delta
compression has emerged as a method to mitigate the resource challenges of
deploying numerous such models by effectively compressing the delta model
parameters. Previous delta-sparsification methods either remove parameters
randomly or truncate singular vectors directly after singular value
decomposition (SVD). However, these methods either disregard parameter
importance entirely or evaluate it with too coarse a granularity. In this work,
we introduce ImPart, a novel importance-aware delta sparsification approach.
Leveraging SVD, it dynamically adjusts sparsity ratios of different singular
vectors based on their importance, effectively retaining crucial task-specific
knowledge even at high sparsity ratios. Experiments show that ImPart achieves
state-of-the-art delta sparsification performance, demonstrating $2\times$
higher compression ratio than baselines at the same performance level. When
integrated with existing methods, ImPart sets a new state-of-the-art on delta
quantization and model merging.

### [7] [CPG-EVAL: A Multi-Tiered Benchmark for Evaluating the Chinese Pedagogical Grammar Competence of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13261)
*Dong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: CPG-EVAL是首个专门评估大语言模型（LLMs）在外语教学中语法能力的基准测试，发现小模型在单一任务中表现较好，但大模型在抗干扰方面更优，但仍需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在外语教学中的语法能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 设计了包含五项任务的CPG-EVAL基准测试，评估语法识别、细粒度区分等能力。

Result: 小模型在单一任务中表现良好，但大模型抗干扰能力更强，整体仍有提升空间。

Conclusion: CPG-EVAL为LLMs在教育中的应用提供了理论驱动的评估框架，并为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Purpose: The rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT
has significantly impacted foreign language education, yet their pedagogical
grammar competence remains under-assessed. This paper introduces CPG-EVAL, the
first dedicated benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of
pedagogical grammar within the context of foreign language instruction.
Methodology: The benchmark comprises five tasks designed to assess grammar
recognition, fine-grained grammatical distinction, categorical discrimination,
and resistance to linguistic interference. Findings: Smaller-scale models can
succeed in single language instance tasks, but struggle with multiple instance
tasks and interference from confusing instances. Larger-scale models show
better resistance to interference but still have significant room for accuracy
improvement. The evaluation indicates the need for better instructional
alignment and more rigorous benchmarks, to effectively guide the deployment of
LLMs in educational contexts. Value: This study offers the first specialized,
theory-driven, multi-tiered benchmark framework for systematically evaluating
LLMs' pedagogical grammar competence in Chinese language teaching contexts.
CPG-EVAL not only provides empirical insights for educators, policymakers, and
model developers to better gauge AI's current abilities in educational
settings, but also lays the groundwork for future research on improving model
alignment, enhancing educational suitability, and ensuring informed
decision-making concerning LLM integration in foreign language instruction.

Method: 通过扫描Twitter和Facebook上与主题相关的评论，并应用情感分析模型，收集年轻人的普遍情绪。

Result: 研究发现年轻人对移动互联网价格与服务质量的感受存在一定关联，具体情感倾向需进一步分析。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了社交媒体作为年轻人表达意见的重要渠道，为运营商改进服务提供了参考。

Abstract: Internet penetration rates in Africa are rising steadily, and mobile Internet
is getting an even bigger boost with the availability of smartphones. Young
people are increasingly using the Internet, especially social networks, and
Senegal is no exception to this revolution. Social networks have become the
main means of expression for young people. Despite this evolution in Internet
access, there are few operators on the market, which limits the alternatives
available in terms of value for money. In this paper, we will look at how young
people feel about the price of mobile Internet in Senegal, in relation to the
perceived quality of the service, through their comments on social networks. We
scanned a set of Twitter and Facebook comments related to the subject and
applied a sentiment analysis model to gather their general feelings.

### [9] [THOUGHTTERMINATOR: Benchmarking, Calibrating, and Mitigating Overthinking in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13367)
*Xiao Pu,Michael Saxon,Wenyue Hua,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文研究了推理模型在任务中过度生成不必要标记的问题，提出了问题难度与最优标记消耗的关系，并评估了模型的校准效果。作者还提出了DUMB500数据集和THOUGHTTERMINATOR解码技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但存在过度生成不必要标记的问题，影响效率。

Method: 引入问题难度近似度量，评估模型校准效果，并提出DUMB500数据集和THOUGHTTERMINATOR解码技术。

Result: 发现推理模型校准效果普遍较差，尤其在简单问题上。THOUGHTTERMINATOR显著改善了校准效果。

Conclusion: 问题难度与最优标记消耗相关，THOUGHTTERMINATOR是一种有效的改进方法。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated impressive performance on difficult tasks
that traditional language models struggle at. However, many are plagued with
the problem of overthinking--generating large amounts of unnecessary tokens
which don't improve accuracy on a question. We introduce approximate measures
of problem-level difficulty and demonstrate that a clear relationship between
problem difficulty and optimal token spend exists, and evaluate how well
calibrated a variety of reasoning models are in terms of efficiently allocating
the optimal token count. We find that in general, reasoning models are poorly
calibrated, particularly on easy problems. To evaluate calibration on easy
questions we introduce DUMB500, a dataset of extremely easy math, reasoning,
code, and task problems, and jointly evaluate reasoning model on these simple
examples and extremely difficult examples from existing frontier benchmarks on
the same task domain. Finally, we introduce THOUGHTTERMINATOR, a training-free
black box decoding technique that significantly improves reasoning model
calibration.

### [10] [Secure Multifaceted-RAG for Enterprise: Hybrid Knowledge Retrieval with Security Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13425)
*Grace Byun,Shinsun Lee,Nayoung Choi,Jinho Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: SecMulti-RAG框架通过多源检索和本地开源生成器解决企业RAG系统的检索范围限制和数据安全问题，显著提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业RAG系统因检索范围有限和数据安全风险面临挑战，尤其是在内部文档不足时生成不准确或不完整的回答。

Method: 提出SecMulti-RAG框架，结合内部文档、预生成专家知识和外部LLM生成知识，采用本地开源生成器和安全过滤机制。

Result: 在汽车行业报告生成任务中，SecMulti-RAG在正确性、丰富性和实用性上显著优于传统RAG，LLM评估胜率达79.3-91.9%，人工评估胜率达56.3-70.4%。

Conclusion: SecMulti-RAG是企业RAG的实用且安全的解决方案，兼顾生成质量和数据安全。

Abstract: Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face challenges in
enterprise settings due to limited retrieval scope and data security risks.
When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to
generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source
Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary
information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG
(SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but
also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for
anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate
security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize
external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This
approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In
our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry,
SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9
percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based
evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights
SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.

### [11] [D-GEN: Automatic Distractor Generation and Evaluation for Reliable Assessment of Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13439)
*Grace Byun,Jinho Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: D-GEN是一个开源干扰项生成模型，将开放式数据转化为多选题格式，并通过排名对齐和熵分析评估干扰项质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放式生成模型评估中响应格式不一致的问题，同时减少高质量干扰项生成的时间和人力成本。

Method: 提出D-GEN模型，采用排名对齐和熵分析两种新方法评估干扰项质量。

Result: D-GEN在排名一致性（Spearman's rho 0.99, Kendall's tau 0.94）和熵分布上与真实干扰项接近，人类评估也验证了其质量。

Conclusion: D-GEN为多选题评估提供了高效、自动化的干扰项生成和评估方法，设定了新标准。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models with open-ended generation is challenging due to
inconsistencies in response formats. Multiple-choice (MC) evaluation mitigates
this issue, but generating high-quality distractors is time-consuming and
labor-intensive. We introduce D-GEN, the first open-source distractor generator
model that transforms open-ended data into an MC format. To evaluate distractor
quality, we propose two novel methods: (1) ranking alignment, ensuring
generated distractors retain the discriminatory power of ground-truth
distractors, and (2) entropy analysis, comparing model confidence
distributions. Our results show that D-GEN preserves ranking consistency
(Spearman's rho 0.99, Kendall's tau 0.94) and closely matches the entropy
distribution of ground-truth distractors. Human evaluation further confirms the
fluency, coherence, distractiveness, and incorrectness. Our work advances
robust and efficient distractor generation with automated evaluation, setting a
new standard for MC evaluation.

*Jiliang Ni,Jiachen Pu,Zhongyi Yang,Kun Zhou,Hui Wang,Xiaoliang Xiao,Dakui Wang,Xin Li,Jingfeng Luo,Conggang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文提出了一种三阶段的高效LLM部署流程，通过原型设计、知识转移和模型压缩，解决了LLM框架中的成本与性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一阶段LLM部署方法虽然有效，但成本高且延迟大，需要优化。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1）构建原型系统生成高质量数据；2）通过知识转移技术训练小型学生模型；3）通过量化和剪枝进一步压缩模型。

Result: 最终得到一个0.4B的超小型模型，实现了超低延迟和低成本。

Conclusion: 该框架的模块化设计和跨领域能力表明其可应用于其他NLP领域。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
artificial intelligence by optimizing traditional Natural Language Processing
(NLP) pipelines, improving performance and generalization. This has spurred
their integration into various systems. Many NLP systems, including ours,
employ a "one-stage" pipeline directly incorporating LLMs. While effective,
this approach incurs substantial costs and latency due to the need for large
model parameters to achieve satisfactory outcomes. This paper introduces a
three-stage cost-efficient end-to-end LLM deployment pipeline-including
prototyping, knowledge transfer, and model compression-to tackle the
cost-performance dilemma in LLM-based frameworks. Our approach yields a super
tiny model optimized for cost and performance in online systems, simplifying
the system architecture. Initially, by transforming complex tasks into a
function call-based LLM-driven pipeline, an optimal performance prototype
system is constructed to produce high-quality data as a teacher model. The
second stage combine techniques like rejection fine-tuning, reinforcement
learning and knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge to a smaller 0.5B
student model, delivering effective performance at minimal cost. The final
stage applies quantization and pruning to extremely compress model to 0.4B,
achieving ultra-low latency and cost. The framework's modular design and
cross-domain capabilities suggest potential applicability in other NLP areas.

*Chenwei Yan,Xiangling Fu,Yuxuan Xiong,Tianyi Wang,Siu Cheung Hui,Ji Wu,Xien Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在临床诊断中对关键医学信息的敏感性，发现现有模型在此方面存在局限性，并提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床诊断对LLMs的可靠性和敏感性要求更高，但现有研究多关注无关上下文，忽略了关键信息的重要性。

Method: 通过引入不同的扰动策略，评估了GPT-3.5、GPT-4、Gemini、Claude3和LLaMA2-7b等LLMs对关键医学信息的敏感性。

Result: 结果显示当前LLMs在诊断决策中对关键医学信息的敏感性不足。

Conclusion: LLMs的发展需提升对关键信息的敏感性和利用能力，以增强人类信任并促进实际应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various domains. However, for clinical diagnosis, higher expectations are
required for LLM's reliability and sensitivity: thinking like physicians and
remaining sensitive to key medical information that affects diagnostic
reasoning, as subtle variations can lead to different diagnosis results. Yet,
existing works focus mainly on investigating the sensitivity of LLMs to
irrelevant context and overlook the importance of key information. In this
paper, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs, i.e. GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini,
Claude3 and LLaMA2-7b, to key medical information by introducing different
perturbation strategies. The evaluation results highlight the limitations of
current LLMs in remaining sensitive to key medical information for diagnostic
decision-making. The evolution of LLMs must focus on improving their
reliability, enhancing their ability to be sensitive to key information, and
effectively utilizing this information. These improvements will enhance human
trust in LLMs and facilitate their practical application in real-world
scenarios. Our code and dataset are available at

*Jianing Wang,Jin Jiang,Yang Liu,Mengdi Zhang,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为“过程预判”的策略，通过预判错误提升LLM的推理能力，避免单纯试错。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM推理依赖试错，缺乏类似人类的预判能力，导致效率低下。

Method: 引入预判节点，结合动态树搜索框架，并通过SFT和RL两阶段训练增强模型。

Result: 实验证明该方法显著提升LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Conclusion: “过程预判”策略有效提升了LLM的推理能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new \emph{process prejudge} strategy in LLM
reasoning to demonstrate that bootstrapping with process prejudge allows the
LLM to adaptively anticipate the errors encountered when advancing the
subsequent reasoning steps, similar to people sometimes pausing to think about
what mistakes may occur and how to avoid them, rather than relying solely on
trial and error. Specifically, we define a prejudge node in the rationale,
which represents a reasoning step, with at least one step that follows the
prejudge node that has no paths toward the correct answer. To synthesize the
prejudge reasoning process, we present an automated reasoning framework with a
dynamic tree-searching strategy. This framework requires only one LLM to
perform answer judging, response critiquing, prejudge generation, and thought
completion. Furthermore, we develop a two-phase training mechanism with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to further enhance
the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results from competition-level
complex reasoning demonstrate that our method can teach the model to prejudge
before thinking and significantly enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs. Code

language models (LLMs) in complex tasks, it still has two main challenges: the
low reliability of relying solely on LLMs to generate reasoning chains and the
interference of natural language reasoning chains on the inference logic of
LLMs. To address these issues, we propose CoT-RAG, a novel reasoning framework
with three key designs: (i) Knowledge Graph-driven CoT Generation, featuring
knowledge graphs to modulate reasoning chain generation of LLMs, thereby
enhancing reasoning credibility; (ii) Learnable Knowledge Case-aware RAG, which
incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into knowledge graphs to
retrieve relevant sub-cases and sub-descriptions, providing LLMs with learnable
information; (iii) Pseudo-Program Prompting Execution, which encourages LLMs to
execute reasoning tasks in pseudo-programs with greater logical rigor. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation on nine public datasets, covering three
reasoning problems. Compared with the-state-of-the-art methods, CoT-RAG
exhibits a significant accuracy improvement, ranging from 4.0% to 23.0%.
Furthermore, testing on four domain-specific datasets, CoT-RAG shows remarkable
accuracy and efficient execution, highlighting its strong practical
applicability and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银行业客户反馈涉及多种语言（英语、僧伽罗语、新加坡式英语和混合文本），现有模型对低资源语言处理不足且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 结合XLM-RoBERTa（针对僧伽罗语和混合文本）和BERT-base-uncased（针对英语），集成领域特定词典校正，并使用SHAP和LIME提升可解释性。

Result: 在英语中达到92.3%的准确率和0.89的F1分数，在僧伽罗语和混合文本中达到88.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多语言、低资源NLP和可解释性方面的空白，为金融应用提供了透明且鲁棒的情感分析工具。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is crucial for brand reputation management in the banking
sector, where customer feedback spans English, Sinhala, Singlish, and
code-mixed text. Existing models struggle with low-resource languages like
Sinhala and lack interpretability for practical use. This research develops a
hybrid aspect-based sentiment analysis framework that enhances multilingual
capabilities with explainable outputs. Using cleaned banking customer reviews,
we fine-tune XLM-RoBERTa for Sinhala and code-mixed text, integrate
domain-specific lexicon correction, and employ BERT-base-uncased for English.
The system classifies sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) with confidence
scores, while SHAP and LIME improve interpretability by providing real-time
sentiment explanations. Experimental results show that our approaches
outperform traditional transformer-based classifiers, achieving 92.3 percent
accuracy and an F1-score of 0.89 in English and 88.4 percent in Sinhala and
code-mixed content. An explainability analysis reveals key sentiment drivers,
improving trust and transparency. A user-friendly interface delivers
aspect-wise sentiment insights, ensuring accessibility for businesses. This
research contributes to robust, transparent sentiment analysis for financial
applications by bridging gaps in multilingual, low-resource NLP and
explainability.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: DETAM是一种无需微调的防御方法，通过修改注意力机制来增强LLMs对越狱攻击的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法（如微调或输入修改）泛化能力有限且可能降低模型实用性，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 分析注意力分数差异，识别对越狱攻击敏感的注意力头，并在推理时重新分配注意力以强调用户核心意图。

Result: DETAM在越狱防御中表现优于基线方法，泛化能力强，且对模型实用性影响小。

Conclusion: DETAM是一种高效且通用的防御方法，适用于多种攻击和模型。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), jailbreak
attacks have become an increasingly pressing safety concern. While
safety-aligned LLMs can effectively defend against normal harmful queries, they
remain vulnerable to such attacks. Existing defense methods primarily rely on
fine-tuning or input modification, which often suffer from limited
generalization and reduced utility. To address this, we introduce DETAM, a
finetuning-free defense approach that improves the defensive capabilities
against jailbreak attacks of LLMs via targeted attention modification.
Specifically, we analyze the differences in attention scores between successful
and unsuccessful defenses to identify the attention heads sensitive to
jailbreak attacks. During inference, we reallocate attention to emphasize the
user's core intention, minimizing interference from attack tokens. Our
experimental results demonstrate that DETAM outperforms various baselines in
jailbreak defense and exhibits robust generalization across different attacks
and models, maintaining its effectiveness even on in-the-wild jailbreak data.
Furthermore, in evaluating the model's utility, we incorporated over-defense
datasets, which further validate the superior performance of our approach. The
code will be released immediately upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有方法在遇到未见意图时性能下降，导致任务路由错误，亟需提升模型在未见任务上的泛化能力。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）结合奖励课程采样（RCS）进行组相对策略优化（GRPO）训练，并引入思维链（COT）过程。

Result: 实验表明，RL训练的模型在泛化性能上显著优于监督微调基线，RCS和COT进一步提升了RL的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了意图检测的泛化能力，为部署适应性强的对话系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Intent detection, a critical component in task-oriented dialogue (TOD)
systems, faces significant challenges in adapting to the rapid influx of
integrable tools with complex interrelationships. Existing approaches, such as
zero-shot reformulations and LLM-based dynamic recognition, struggle with
performance degradation when encountering unseen intents, leading to erroneous
task routing. To enhance the model's generalization performance on unseen
tasks, we employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) combined with a Reward-based
Curriculum Sampling (RCS) during Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
training in intent detection tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained
models substantially outperform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baselines in
generalization. Besides, the introduction of the RCS, significantly bolsters
the effectiveness of RL in intent detection by focusing the model on
challenging cases during training. Moreover, incorporating Chain-of-Thought
(COT) processes in RL notably improves generalization in complex intent
detection tasks, underscoring the importance of thought in challenging
scenarios. This work advances the generalization of intent detection tasks,
offering practical insights for deploying adaptable dialogue systems.

Motivation: 法律LLMs在自动化任务和提升研究精度方面有显著进展，但适应法律领域仍面临挑战，如法律推理复杂性和专业语言解释需求。

Method: 通过在中国台湾法律框架下的一系列法律推理任务实验，评估DACP的效果。

Result: DACP能增强领域知识，但对所有法律任务的性能提升不一致。

Conclusion: 讨论了DACP的权衡，并提出未来研究方向以优化法律AI的领域适应策略。

Abstract: The recent advances in Legal Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed
the landscape of legal research and practice by automating tasks, enhancing
research precision, and supporting complex decision-making processes. However,
effectively adapting LLMs to the legal domain remains challenging due to the
complexity of legal reasoning, the need for precise interpretation of
specialized language, and the potential for hallucinations. This paper examines
the efficacy of Domain-Adaptive Continual Pre-Training (DACP) in improving the
legal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Through a series of experiments on legal
reasoning tasks within the Taiwanese legal framework, we demonstrate that while
DACP enhances domain-specific knowledge, it does not uniformly improve
performance across all legal tasks. We discuss the trade-offs involved in DACP,
particularly its impact on model generalization and performance in prompt-based
tasks, and propose directions for future research to optimize domain adaptation
strategies in legal AI.

TLDR: 研究探讨了在低资源印度语言中，通过上下文缩短技术（如OIE、共指消解和APS）提升QA任务性能的方法，结果显示语义和标记级分数均有提升，同时减少了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文对LLMs的QA任务构成挑战，尤其在低资源语言中，研究旨在通过上下文缩短技术提高效率和效果。

Method: 采用Open Information Extraction (OIE)、共指消解和Answer Paragraph Selection (APS)等技术缩短上下文，并在四种印度语言（印地语、泰米尔语、泰卢固语和乌尔都语）上进行实验。

Result: 上下文缩短技术平均提升语义分数4%和标记级分数47%，微调后两者均提升2%，同时减少了计算开销。

Conclusion: 上下文缩短技术能有效提升LLM-based QA系统的效率和性能，尤其适用于低资源语言，但对非事实性问题（如需要推理或辩论的问题）仍有局限性。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) tasks, which involve extracting answers from a given
context, are relatively straightforward for modern Large Language Models (LLMs)
when the context is short. However, long contexts pose challenges due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. This challenge is
compounded in Indic languages, which are often low-resource. This study
explores context-shortening techniques, including Open Information Extraction
(OIE), coreference resolution, Answer Paragraph Selection (APS), and their
combinations, to improve QA performance. Compared to the baseline of
unshortened (long) contexts, our experiments on four Indic languages (Hindi,
Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu) demonstrate that context-shortening techniques yield
an average improvement of 4\% in semantic scores and 47\% in token-level scores
when evaluated on three popular LLMs without fine-tuning. Furthermore, with
fine-tuning, we achieve an average increase of 2\% in both semantic and
token-level scores. Additionally, context-shortening reduces computational
overhead. Explainability techniques like LIME and SHAP reveal that when the APS
model confidently identifies the paragraph containing the answer, nearly all
tokens within the selected text receive high relevance scores. However, the
study also highlights the limitations of LLM-based QA systems in addressing
non-factoid questions, particularly those requiring reasoning or debate.
Moreover, verbalizing OIE-generated triples does not enhance system
performance. These findings emphasize the potential of context-shortening
techniques to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM-based QA systems,
especially for low-resource languages. The source code and resources are
available at https://github.com/ritwikmishra/IndicGenQA.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为ThoughtMani的方法，通过在小模型生成的外部CoTs中插入思考标记，有效减少大型推理模型（LRMs）的冗余推理步骤，从而降低计算成本并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）存在“过度思考”问题，即生成冗余推理步骤但性能提升有限。现有方法依赖微调，但存在数据需求高、训练复杂、安全性差和泛化能力不足等问题。

Method: 通过在小模型生成的外部CoTs中插入思考标记（<think>和</think>），设计了一个简单高效的流程ThoughtMani，以减少LRMs的冗余推理步骤。

Result: 在QwQ-32B模型上，ThoughtMani保持了原始性能，同时减少了约30%的输出标记数量，且安全对齐性平均提升了10%。

Conclusion: ThoughtMani为构建更高效、更易用的大型推理模型提供了一种有效方法，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
effectiveness of scaling test-time computation to enhance reasoning
capabilities in multiple tasks. However, LRMs typically suffer from
"overthinking" problems, where models generate significantly redundant
reasoning steps while bringing limited performance gains. Existing work relies
on fine-tuning to mitigate overthinking, which requires additional data,
unconventional training setups, risky safety misalignment, and poor
generalization.
  Through empirical analysis, we reveal an important characteristic of LRM
behaviors that placing external CoTs generated by smaller models between the
thinking token ($\texttt{<think>}$ and $\texttt{</think>)}$ can effectively
manipulate the model to generate fewer thoughts. Building on these insights, we
propose a simple yet efficient pipeline, ThoughtMani, to enable LRMs to bypass
unnecessary intermediate steps and reduce computational costs significantly. We
conduct extensive experiments to validate the utility and efficiency of
ThoughtMani. For instance, when applied to QwQ-32B on the LiveBench/Code
dataset, ThoughtMani keeps the original performance and reduces output token
counts by approximately 30%, with little overhead from the CoT generator.
Furthermore, we find that ThoughtMani enhances safety alignment by an average
of 10%. Since model vendors typically serve models of different sizes
simultaneously, ThoughtMani provides an effective way to construct more
efficient and accessible LRMs for real-world applications.

Result: 发现LLM使用在学科、性别、母语状态和职业阶段上存在显著差异，并显著提升写作的清晰度、简洁性和规范性。早期使用者、男性、非母语者和初级学者的风格变化最明显。

Conclusion: LLM推动了学术写作的趋同，但不同群体的采用程度和效果各异，早期采用者和特定群体受益更多。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are reshaping content creation
and academic writing. This study investigates the impact of AI-assisted
generative revisions on research manuscripts, focusing on heterogeneous
adoption patterns and their influence on writing convergence. Leveraging a
dataset of over 627,000 academic papers from arXiv, we develop a novel
classification framework by fine-tuning prompt- and discipline-specific large
language models to detect the style of ChatGPT-revised texts. Our findings
reveal substantial disparities in LLM adoption across academic disciplines,
gender, native language status, and career stage, alongside a rapid evolution
in scholarly writing styles. Moreover, LLM usage enhances clarity, conciseness,
and adherence to formal writing conventions, with improvements varying by
revision type. Finally, a difference-in-differences analysis shows that while
LLMs drive convergence in academic writing, early adopters, male researchers,
non-native speakers, and junior scholars exhibit the most pronounced stylistic
shifts, aligning their writing more closely with that of established
researchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MT评估中人类评分的噪声和不一致性是关键挑战，现有方法在系统级和片段级评估中存在不足。

Method: ReMedy通过奖励建模任务学习相对翻译质量，而非直接回归不完美的人类评分。

Result: 在WMT22-24共享任务中，ReMedy-9B在片段级和系统级评估中均达到最先进水平，超越多个大型模型。

Conclusion: ReMedy在检测翻译错误和评估低质量翻译方面表现出色，为MT评估提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: A key challenge in MT evaluation is the inherent noise and inconsistency of
human ratings. Regression-based neural metrics struggle with this noise, while
prompting LLMs shows promise at system-level evaluation but performs poorly at
segment level. In this work, we propose ReMedy, a novel MT metric framework
that reformulates translation evaluation as a reward modeling task. Instead of
regressing on imperfect human ratings directly, ReMedy learns relative
translation quality using pairwise preference data, resulting in a more
reliable evaluation. In extensive experiments across WMT22-24 shared tasks (39
language pairs, 111 MT systems), ReMedy achieves state-of-the-art performance
at both segment- and system-level evaluation. Specifically, ReMedy-9B surpasses
larger WMT winners and massive closed LLMs such as MetricX-13B,
XCOMET-Ensemble, GEMBA-GPT-4, PaLM-540B, and finetuned PaLM2. Further analyses
demonstrate that ReMedy delivers superior capability in detecting translation
errors and evaluating low-quality translations.

Result: 实验证明UDP在协作与非协作场景下均能有效学习用户特定对话策略，表现出鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: UDP框架为以用户为中心的对话系统提供了实用且高效的方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in dialogue policy planning have emphasized optimizing
system agent policies to achieve predefined goals, focusing on strategy design,
trajectory acquisition, and efficient training paradigms. However, these
approaches often overlook the critical role of user characteristics, which are
essential in real-world scenarios like conversational search and
recommendation, where interactions must adapt to individual user traits such as
personality, preferences, and goals. To address this gap, we first conduct a
comprehensive study utilizing task-specific user personas to systematically
assess dialogue policy planning under diverse user behaviors. By leveraging
realistic user profiles for different tasks, our study reveals significant
limitations in existing approaches, highlighting the need for user-tailored
dialogue policy planning. Building on this foundation, we present the
User-Tailored Dialogue Policy Planning (UDP) framework, which incorporates an
Intrinsic User World Model to model user traits and feedback. UDP operates in
three stages: (1) User Persona Portraying, using a diffusion model to
dynamically infer user profiles; (2) User Feedback Anticipating, leveraging a
Brownian Bridge-inspired anticipator to predict user reactions; and (3)
User-Tailored Policy Planning, integrating these insights to optimize response
strategies. To ensure robust performance, we further propose an active learning
approach that prioritizes challenging user personas during training.
Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks, including collaborative and
non-collaborative settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of UDP in learning
user-specific dialogue strategies. Results validate the protocol's utility and
highlight UDP's robustness, adaptability, and potential to advance user-centric
dialogue systems.

Abstract: Telecom services are at the core of today's societies' everyday needs. The
availability of numerous online forums and discussion platforms enables telecom
providers to improve their services by exploring the views of their customers
to learn about common issues that the customers face. Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tools can be used to process the free text collected.
  One way of working with such data is to represent text as numerical vectors
using one of many word embedding models based on neural networks. This research
uses a novel dataset of telecom customers' reviews to perform an extensive
study showing how different word embedding algorithms can affect the text
classification process. Several state-of-the-art word embedding techniques are
considered, including BERT, Word2Vec and Doc2Vec, coupled with several
classification algorithms. The important issue of feature engineering and
dimensionality reduction is addressed and several PCA-based approaches are
explored. Moreover, the energy consumption used by the different word
embeddings is investigated. The findings show that some word embedding models
can lead to consistently better text classifiers in terms of precision, recall
and F1-Score. In particular, for the more challenging classification tasks,
BERT combined with PCA stood out with the highest performance metrics.
Moreover, our proposed PCA approach of combining word vectors using the first
principal component shows clear advantages in performance over the traditional
approach of taking the average.

Result: 实验表明MCCRS性能显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MCCRS通过多类型上下文信息和专家协作，突破了单一上下文的瓶颈，提升了推荐效果。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems enable natural language conversations and
thus lead to a more engaging and effective recommendation scenario. As the
conversations for recommender systems usually contain limited contextual
information, many existing conversational recommender systems incorporate
external sources to enrich the contextual information. However, how to combine
different types of contextual information is still a challenge. In this paper,
we propose a multi-type context-aware conversational recommender system, called
MCCRS, effectively fusing multi-type contextual information via
mixture-of-experts to improve conversational recommender systems. MCCRS
incorporates both structured information and unstructured information,
including the structured knowledge graph, unstructured conversation history,
and unstructured item reviews. It consists of several experts, with each expert
specialized in a particular domain (i.e., one specific contextual information).
Multiple experts are then coordinated by a ChairBot to generate the final
results. Our proposed MCCRS model takes advantage of different contextual
information and the specialization of different experts followed by a ChairBot
breaks the model bottleneck on a single contextual information. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed MCCRS method achieves significantly
higher performance compared to existing baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进语言模型的安全性和可靠性需要准确的不确定性量化（UQ）评估，但现有评估方法因正确性函数的偏差而失真。

Method: 评估了7种正确性函数（包括基于词汇、嵌入和LLM-as-a-judge方法）在4个数据集、4个模型和6种UQ方法上的表现。

Result: 发现正确性函数的长度偏差与UQ方法的长度偏差相互作用，导致评估失真；LLM-as-a-judge方法偏差较小。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-judge方法可能是减少UQ评估偏差的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in Language Models (LMs) is crucial for
improving their safety and reliability. Evaluations often use performance
metrics like AUROC to assess how well UQ methods (e.g., negative sequence
probabilities) correlate with task correctness functions (e.g., ROUGE-L). In
this paper, we show that commonly used correctness functions bias UQ
evaluations by inflating the performance of certain UQ methods. We evaluate 7
correctness functions -- from lexical-based and embedding-based metrics to
LLM-as-a-judge approaches -- across 4 datasets x 4 models x 6 UQ methods. Our
analysis reveals that length biases in the errors of these correctness
functions distort UQ assessments by interacting with length biases in UQ
methods. We identify LLM-as-a-judge approaches as among the least length-biased
choices and hence a potential solution to mitigate these biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文献综述方法在处理大规模研究内容时效率低下且难以保证一致性，因此需要一种更高效的方法来增强知识合成的广度和深度。

Method: 通过微调开源LLMs，结合人工验证，构建了一个能够从大量研究内容中提取定性见解的框架。

Result: 应用于20000多篇关于人类迁移的科学文章，结果表明领域适应的LLM可以准确选择相关研究、检测新兴趋势并识别研究空白。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了微调LLMs在多学科文献综述中的潜力，能够加速知识合成和科学发现。

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid framework for literature reviews that augments
traditional bibliometric methods with large language models (LLMs). By
fine-tuning open-source LLMs, our approach enables scalable extraction of
qualitative insights from large volumes of research content, enhancing both the
breadth and depth of knowledge synthesis. To improve annotation efficiency and
consistency, we introduce an error-focused validation process in which LLMs
generate initial labels and human reviewers correct misclassifications.
Applying this framework to over 20000 scientific articles about human
migration, we demonstrate that a domain-adapted LLM can serve as a "specialist"
model - capable of accurately selecting relevant studies, detecting emerging
trends, and identifying critical research gaps. Notably, the LLM-assisted
review reveals a growing scholarly interest in climate-induced migration.
However, existing literature disproportionately centers on a narrow set of
environmental hazards (e.g., floods, droughts, sea-level rise, and land
degradation), while overlooking others that more directly affect human health
and well-being, such as air and water pollution or infectious diseases. This
imbalance highlights the need for more comprehensive research that goes beyond
physical environmental changes to examine their ecological and societal
consequences, particularly in shaping migration as an adaptive response.
Overall, our proposed framework demonstrates the potential of fine-tuned LLMs
to conduct more efficient, consistent, and insightful literature reviews across
disciplines, ultimately accelerating knowledge synthesis and scientific
discovery.

Conclusion: CONTACT证明少量标注的LLMs能有效减少标注负担，支持从OSINT流中提取结构化信息。

Abstract: Open-source intelligence provides a stream of unstructured textual data that
can inform assessments of territorial control. We present CONTACT, a framework
for territorial control prediction using large language models (LLMs) and
minimal supervision. We evaluate two approaches: SetFit, an embedding-based
few-shot classifier, and a prompt tuning method applied to BLOOMZ-560m, a
multilingual generative LLM. Our model is trained on a small hand-labeled
dataset of news articles covering ISIS activity in Syria and Iraq, using
prompt-conditioned extraction of control-relevant signals such as military
operations, casualties, and location references. We show that the BLOOMZ-based
model outperforms the SetFit baseline, and that prompt-based supervision
improves generalization in low-resource settings. CONTACT demonstrates that

Abstract: Previous insertion-based and paraphrase-based backdoors have achieved great
success in attack efficacy, but they ignore the text quality and semantic
consistency between poisoned and clean texts. Although recent studies introduce
LLMs to generate poisoned texts and improve the stealthiness, semantic
consistency, and text quality, their hand-crafted prompts rely on expert
experiences, facing significant challenges in prompt adaptability and attack
performance after defenses. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack
based on adaptive optimization mechanism of black-box large language models
(BadApex), which leverages a black-box LLM to generate poisoned text through a
refined prompt. Specifically, an Adaptive Optimization Mechanism is designed to
refine an initial prompt iteratively using the generation and modification
agents. The generation agent generates the poisoned text based on the initial
prompt. Then the modification agent evaluates the quality of the poisoned text
and refines a new prompt. After several iterations of the above process, the
refined prompt is used to generate poisoned texts through LLMs. We conduct
extensive experiments on three dataset with six backdoor attacks and two
defenses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadApex significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. It improves prompt adaptability, semantic
consistency, and text quality. Furthermore, when two defense methods are
applied, the average attack success rate (ASR) still up to 96.75%.

Abstract: While understanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs is crucial to prevent
hallucination, research on knowledge boundaries of LLMs has predominantly
focused on English. In this work, we present the first study to analyze how
LLMs recognize knowledge boundaries across different languages by probing their
internal representations when processing known and unknown questions in
multiple languages. Our empirical studies reveal three key findings: 1) LLMs'
perceptions of knowledge boundaries are encoded in the middle to middle-upper
layers across different languages. 2) Language differences in knowledge
boundary perception follow a linear structure, which motivates our proposal of
a training-free alignment method that effectively transfers knowledge boundary
perception ability across languages, thereby helping reduce hallucination risk
in low-resource languages; 3) Fine-tuning on bilingual question pair
translation further enhances LLMs' recognition of knowledge boundaries across
languages. Given the absence of standard testbeds for cross-lingual knowledge
boundary analysis, we construct a multilingual evaluation suite comprising
three representative types of knowledge boundary data. Our code and datasets
are publicly available at

decoupling distillation, have notably improved student model performance. These
techniques focus on stimulus complexity, attention mechanisms, and global
information capture to optimize knowledge transfer. In addition, KD has proven
effective in compressing large language models while preserving accuracy,

Abstract: The first generation of Large Language Models - what might be called "Act I"
of generative AI (2020-2023) - achieved remarkable success through massive
parameter and data scaling, yet exhibited fundamental limitations in knowledge
latency, shallow reasoning, and constrained cognitive processes. During this
era, prompt engineering emerged as our primary interface with AI, enabling
dialogue-level communication through natural language. We now witness the
emergence of "Act II" (2024-present), where models are transitioning from
knowledge-retrieval systems (in latent space) to thought-construction engines
through test-time scaling techniques. This new paradigm establishes a
mind-level connection with AI through language-based thoughts. In this paper,
we clarify the conceptual foundations of cognition engineering and explain why
this moment is critical for its development. We systematically break down these
advanced approaches through comprehensive tutorials and optimized
implementations, democratizing access to cognition engineering and enabling
every practitioner to participate in AI's second act. We provide a regularly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学知识快速增长，现有工具如引用网络和搜索引擎缺乏灵活的抽象能力，难以追踪跨学科的进展和高层次概念联系。

Method: 结合快速嵌入聚类和LLM提示，平衡计算效率和语义精度，构建多维度分类的科学文献层次结构。

Result: 该方法在质量和速度上优于依赖LLM提示的迭代树构建方法，增强了文献探索的效率和可解释性。

Conclusion: SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY提供了一种结构化探索科学文献的新途径，支持趋势发现和跨学科研究。

Abstract: Scientific knowledge is growing rapidly, making it challenging to track
progress and high-level conceptual links across broad disciplines. While
existing tools like citation networks and search engines make it easy to access
a few related papers, they fundamentally lack the flexible abstraction needed
to represent the density of activity in various scientific subfields. We
motivate SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY, the goal of organizing scientific literature
into a high-quality hierarchical structure that allows for the categorization
of scientific work across varying levels of abstraction, from very broad fields
to very specific studies. Such a representation can provide insights into which
fields are well-explored and which are under-explored. To achieve the goals of
SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY, we develop a range of algorithms. Our primary approach
combines fast embedding-based clustering with LLM-based prompting to balance
the computational efficiency of embedding methods with the semantic precision
offered by LLM prompting. We demonstrate that this approach offers the best
trade-off between quality and speed compared to methods that heavily rely on
LLM prompting, such as iterative tree construction with LLMs. To better reflect
the interdisciplinary and multifaceted nature of research papers, our hierarchy
captures multiple dimensions of categorization beyond simple topic labels. We
evaluate the utility of our framework by assessing how effectively an LLM-based
agent can locate target papers using the hierarchy. Results show that this
structured approach enhances interpretability, supports trend discovery, and
offers an alternative pathway for exploring scientific literature beyond
traditional search methods. Code, data and demo:

Motivation: 现有方法通常仅关注实例质量，依赖启发式规则保持多样性，缺乏对数据集的整体视角，导致结果不理想。

Method: 构建标签图建模语义空间，基于信息分布量化多样性，并提出MIG采样方法迭代选择数据。

Result: 实验表明MIG优于现有方法，仅用5%数据即可达到全数据集训练模型的性能。

Conclusion: MIG方法在语义空间中高效选择数据，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Data quality and diversity are key to the construction of effective
instruction-tuning datasets. % With the increasing availability of open-source
instruction-tuning datasets, it is advantageous to automatically select
high-quality and diverse subsets from a vast amount of data. % Existing methods
typically prioritize instance quality and use heuristic rules to maintain
diversity. % However, this absence of a comprehensive view of the entire
collection often leads to suboptimal results. % Moreover, heuristic rules
generally focus on distance or clustering within the embedding space, which
fails to accurately capture the intent of complex instructions in the semantic
space. % To bridge this gap, we propose a unified method for quantifying the
information content of datasets. This method models the semantic space by
constructing a label graph and quantifies diversity based on the distribution
of information within the graph. % Based on such a measurement, we further
introduce an efficient sampling method that selects data samples iteratively to
\textbf{M}aximize the \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{G}ain (MIG) in semantic
space. % Experiments on various datasets and base models demonstrate that MIG
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. % Notably, the model
fine-tuned with 5\% Tulu3 data sampled by MIG achieves comparable performance
to the official SFT model trained on the full dataset, with improvements of
+5.73\% on AlpacaEval and +6.89\% on Wildbench.

### [36] [Universal Representations for Classification-enhanced Lossy Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13191)
*Nam Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文探讨了在损失压缩中，通过通用编码器实现多种解码目标的方法，验证了其在感知图像压缩任务中的有效性，但在特定分类-失真权衡下存在性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统压缩算法仅关注压缩率与重构失真之间的权衡，而新框架（如RDP和RDC）引入了感知质量和分类准确性作为额外评估维度。本文旨在开发通用编码器，避免为每个特定权衡点重新训练编码器。

Method: 提出通用编码器方法，通过单一编码器实现多种解码目标，并在MNIST数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，通用编码器在感知图像压缩任务中性能接近单独优化的编码器，但在RDC设置下，重用特定分类-失真权衡的编码器会导致显著失真。

Conclusion: 通用编码器在感知压缩中具有潜力，但在分类-失真权衡下需进一步优化以避免性能损失。

Abstract: In lossy compression, the classical tradeoff between compression rate and
reconstruction distortion has traditionally guided algorithm design. However,
Blau and Michaeli [5] introduced a generalized framework, known as the
rate-distortion-perception (RDP) function, incorporating perceptual quality as
an additional dimension of evaluation. More recently, the
rate-distortion-classification (RDC) function was investigated in [19],
evaluating compression performance by considering classification accuracy
alongside distortion. In this paper, we explore universal representations,
where a single encoder is developed to achieve multiple decoding objectives
across various distortion and classification (or perception) constraints. This
universality avoids retraining encoders for each specific operating point
within these tradeoffs. Our experimental validation on the MNIST dataset
indicates that a universal encoder incurs only minimal performance degradation
compared to individually optimized encoders for perceptual image compression
tasks, aligning with prior results from [23]. Nonetheless, we also identify
that in the RDC setting, reusing an encoder optimized for one specific
classification-distortion tradeoff leads to a significant distortion penalty
when applied to alternative points.

Result: 模型能高效准确识别和分割道路裂缝，并分析裂缝的最大、最小宽度及精确位置。

Conclusion: 该系统为道路维护和安全监测提供了新方案，ECA和CBAM机制显著提升了检测精度和效率。

Abstract: As urbanization speeds up and traffic flow increases, the issue of pavement
distress is becoming increasingly pronounced, posing a severe threat to road
safety and service life. Traditional methods of pothole detection rely on
manual inspection, which is not only inefficient but also costly. This paper
proposes an intelligent road crack detection and analysis system, based on the
enhanced YOLOv8 deep learning framework. A target segmentation model has been
developed through the training of 4029 images, capable of efficiently and
accurately recognizing and segmenting crack regions in roads. The model also
analyzes the segmented regions to precisely calculate the maximum and minimum
widths of cracks and their exact locations. Experimental results indicate that
the incorporation of ECA and CBAM attention mechanisms substantially enhances
the model's detection accuracy and efficiency, offering a novel solution for
road maintenance and safety monitoring.

Result: 实验表明，Mirror显著提升了AI治疗师处理抵抗的能力，优于现有文本方法。

Conclusion: 多模态方法在增强AI心理治疗师应对客户抵抗方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) in
psychotherapy; however, text-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) models
often struggle with client resistance, which can weaken therapeutic alliance.
To address this, we propose a multimodal approach that incorporates nonverbal
cues, allowing the AI therapist to better align its responses with the client's
negative emotional state. Specifically, we introduce a new synthetic dataset,
Multimodal Interactive Rolling with Resistance (Mirror), which is a novel
synthetic dataset that pairs client statements with corresponding facial
images. Using this dataset, we train baseline Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
that can analyze facial cues, infer emotions, and generate empathetic responses
to effectively manage resistance. They are then evaluated in terms of both the
therapist's counseling skills and the strength of the therapeutic alliance in
the presence of client resistance. Our results demonstrate that Mirror
significantly enhances the AI therapist's ability to handle resistance, which
outperforms existing text-based CBT approaches.

Result: 在CIFAR-10等数据集上，Wavelet-VAE显著提升了视觉保真度和高分辨率细节恢复能力。

Conclusion: Wavelet-VAE在生成质量上有优势，未来可进一步探索小波生成模型的潜力。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models capable of
learning compact latent representations. However, conventional VAEs often
generate relatively blurry images due to their assumption of an isotropic
Gaussian latent space and constraints in capturing high-frequency details. In
this paper, we explore a novel wavelet-based approach (Wavelet-VAE) in which
the latent space is constructed using multi-scale Haar wavelet coefficients. We
propose a comprehensive method to encode the image features into multi-scale
detail and approximation coefficients and introduce a learnable noise parameter
to maintain stochasticity. We thoroughly discuss how to reformulate the
reparameterization trick, address the KL divergence term, and integrate wavelet
sparsity principles into the training objective. Our experimental evaluation on
CIFAR-10 and other high-resolution datasets demonstrates that the Wavelet-VAE
improves visual fidelity and recovers higher-resolution details compared to
conventional VAEs. We conclude with a discussion of advantages, potential
limitations, and future research directions for wavelet-based generative
modeling.

Method: 设计了结合空间、频谱和时间注意力机制的SSTAF Transformer，通过短时傅里叶变换提取时频特征。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上分别达到76.83%和68.30%的准确率，优于传统CNN和现有Transformer方法。

Conclusion: SSTAF Transformer在运动想象分类任务中表现出色，为EEG信号处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor
imagery classification offer promising solutions in neurorehabilitation and
assistive technologies by enabling communication between the brain and external
devices. However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals and significant
inter-subject variability cause substantial challenges for developing robust
cross-subject classification models. This paper introduces a novel
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically
designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists
of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer
block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention
mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across
multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations,
and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to
extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model
to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer
model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI
Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30%
in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures
and a few existing transformer-based approaches.

Motivation: 多主体风格迁移面临风格属性定义模糊和跨主体一致性问题，现有方法依赖高成本的反演过程或大规模风格数据集，且难以保持语义保真度和高效推理。

Method: ICAS框架结合IP-Adapter进行自适应风格注入和ControlNet进行结构条件控制，通过循环多主体内容嵌入机制，在有限数据下实现风格迁移。

Result: 实验表明，ICAS在结构保持、风格一致性和推理效率方面表现优异。

Conclusion: ICAS为多主体风格迁移提供了一种高效可控的新范式。

Abstract: Generating multi-subject stylized images remains a significant challenge due
to the ambiguity in defining style attributes (e.g., color, texture,
atmosphere, and structure) and the difficulty in consistently applying them
across multiple subjects. Although recent diffusion-based text-to-image models
have achieved remarkable progress, existing methods typically rely on
computationally expensive inversion procedures or large-scale stylized
datasets. Moreover, these methods often struggle with maintaining multi-subject
semantic fidelity and are limited by high inference costs. To address these
limitations, we propose ICAS (IP-Adapter and ControlNet-based Attention
Structure), a novel framework for efficient and controllable multi-subject
style transfer. Instead of full-model tuning, ICAS adaptively fine-tunes only
the content injection branch of a pre-trained diffusion model, thereby
preserving identity-specific semantics while enhancing style controllability.
By combining IP-Adapter for adaptive style injection with ControlNet for
structural conditioning, our framework ensures faithful global layout
preservation alongside accurate local style synthesis. Furthermore, ICAS
introduces a cyclic multi-subject content embedding mechanism, which enables
effective style transfer under limited-data settings without the need for
extensive stylized corpora. Extensive experiments show that ICAS achieves
superior performance in structure preservation, style consistency, and
inference efficiency, establishing a new paradigm for multi-subject style
transfer in real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在HSI分类中存在信息冗余和注意力效率低的问题，难以捕捉细粒度关系。

Method: 提出MemFormer，采用动态内存增强的多头注意力机制和空间-光谱位置编码（SSPE），逐步捕获复杂依赖关系。

Result: 在基准数据集上，MemFormer分类精度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemFormer通过动态内存和SSPE显著提升了HSI分类性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification remains a challenging task due to
the intricate spatial-spectral correlations. Existing transformer models excel
in capturing long-range dependencies but often suffer from information
redundancy and attention inefficiencies, limiting their ability to model
fine-grained relationships crucial for HSI classification. To overcome these
limitations, this work proposes MemFormer, a lightweight and memory-enhanced
transformer. MemFormer introduces a memory-enhanced multi-head attention
mechanism that iteratively refines a dynamic memory module, enhancing feature
extraction while reducing redundancy across layers. Additionally, a dynamic
memory enrichment strategy progressively captures complex spatial and spectral
dependencies, leading to more expressive feature representations. To further
improve structural consistency, we incorporate a spatial-spectral positional
encoding (SSPE) tailored for HSI data, ensuring continuity without the
computational burden of convolution-based approaches. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that MemFormer achieves superior classification
accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

fine-tuned on our dataset for explanation generation achieve superior
performance across various metrics and demonstrate improved accuracy in
question-answering tasks on new datasets. By integrating answers with
explanatory narratives, our approach enhances the ability of intelligent agents
to convey complex information effectively, improve user understanding, and
foster trust in the generated responses.

Abstract: The fine-tuning paradigm has emerged as a prominent approach for addressing
long-tail learning tasks in the era of foundation models. However, the impact
of fine-tuning strategies on long-tail learning performance remains unexplored.
In this work, we disclose that existing paradigms exhibit a profound misuse of
fine-tuning methods, leaving significant room for improvement in both
efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we reveal that heavy fine-tuning
(fine-tuning a large proportion of model parameters) can lead to non-negligible
performance deterioration on tail classes, whereas lightweight fine-tuning
demonstrates superior effectiveness. Through comprehensive theoretical and
empirical validation, we identify this phenomenon as stemming from inconsistent
class conditional distributions induced by heavy fine-tuning. Building on this
insight, we propose LIFT+, an innovative lightweight fine-tuning framework to
optimize consistent class conditions. Furthermore, LIFT+ incorporates
semantic-aware initialization, minimalist data augmentation, and test-time
ensembling to enhance adaptation and generalization of foundation models. Our
framework provides an efficient and accurate pipeline that facilitates fast
convergence and model compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIFT+
significantly reduces both training epochs (from $\sim$100 to $\leq$15) and
learned parameters (less than 1%), while surpassing state-of-the-art approaches
by a considerable margin. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对昂贵3D标注数据的依赖，利用单目相机系统替代LiDAR或多相机配置。

Method: 利用预训练的2D模型估计深度和方向信息作为伪真值，设计损失函数避免3D标注。

Result: 在SUN RGB-D数据集上表现优于标注时间相当的Cube R-CNN基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为弱监督3D检测提供了可行方案，但精度尚不足以支持厘米级测量。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is an essential task in computer vision, and it
has several applications in robotics and virtual reality. However, 3D object
detectors are typically trained in a fully supervised way, relying extensively
on 3D labeled data, which is labor-intensive and costly to annotate. This work
focuses on weakly-supervised 3D detection to reduce data needs using a
monocular method that leverages a singlecamera system over expensive LiDAR
sensors or multi-camera setups. We propose a general model Weak Cube R-CNN,
which can predict objects in 3D at inference time, requiring only 2D box
annotations for training by exploiting the relationship between 2D projections
of 3D cubes. Our proposed method utilizes pre-trained frozen foundation 2D
models to estimate depth and orientation information on a training set. We use
these estimated values as pseudo-ground truths during training. We design loss
functions that avoid 3D labels by incorporating information from the external
models into the loss. In this way, we aim to implicitly transfer knowledge from
these large foundation 2D models without having access to 3D bounding box
annotations. Experimental results on the SUN RGB-D dataset show increased
performance in accuracy compared to an annotation time equalized Cube R-CNN
baseline. While not precise for centimetre-level measurements, this method
provides a strong foundation for further research.

TLDR: TRANSAR是一种基于自监督视觉Transformer的SAR目标检测模型，通过掩码图像预训练和自适应采样调度器，显著提升了小目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中目标检测的挑战包括数据复杂性、标注稀缺和小目标检测困难，传统监督学习方法因缺乏标注数据而受限。

Method: 提出TRANSAR模型，结合掩码图像预训练和辅助二元语义分割，并引入自适应采样调度器解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 在基准SAR数据集上，TRANSAR优于传统监督模型（如DeepLabv3、UNet）和自监督模型（如DPT、SegFormer）。

Conclusion: TRANSAR通过自监督学习和动态调整策略，有效解决了SAR图像中小目标检测的难题，为领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Object detection in satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery
holds immense potential in tasks such as urban monitoring and disaster
response. However, the inherent complexities of SAR data and the scarcity of
annotations present significant challenges in the advancement of object
detection in this domain. Notably, the detection of small objects in
satellite-borne SAR images poses a particularly intricate problem, because of
the technology's relatively low spatial resolution and inherent noise.
Furthermore, the lack of large labelled SAR datasets hinders the development of
supervised deep learning-based object detection models. In this paper, we
introduce TRANSAR, a novel self-supervised end-to-end vision transformer-based
SAR object detection model that incorporates masked image pre-training on an
unlabeled SAR image dataset that spans more than $25,700$ km\textsuperscript{2}
ground area. Unlike traditional object detection formulation, our approach
capitalises on auxiliary binary semantic segmentation, designed to segregate
objects of interest during the post-tuning, especially the smaller ones, from
the background. In addition, to address the innate class imbalance due to the
disproportion of the object to the image size, we introduce an adaptive
sampling scheduler that dynamically adjusts the target class distribution
during training based on curriculum learning and model feedback. This approach
allows us to outperform conventional supervised architecture such as DeepLabv3
or UNet, and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning-based arhitectures such
as DPT, SegFormer or UperNet, as shown by extensive evaluations on benchmark
SAR datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代智能农业中，目标检测对自动化和精准农业至关重要，但数据收集和隐私问题限制了其应用。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型的泛化能力和联邦学习的隐私保护特性，通过训练紧凑提示生成器提升性能。

Result: VLLFL在提升视觉语言模型性能14.53%的同时，减少了99.3%的通信开销。

Abstract: In modern smart agriculture, object detection plays a crucial role by
enabling automation, precision farming, and monitoring of resources. From
identifying crop health and pest infestations to optimizing harvesting
processes, accurate object detection enhances both productivity and
sustainability. However, training object detection models often requires
large-scale data collection and raises privacy concerns, particularly when
sensitive agricultural data is distributed across farms. To address these
challenges, we propose VLLFL, a vision-language model-based lightweight
federated learning framework (VLLFL). It harnesses the generalization and
context-aware detection capabilities of the vision-language model (VLM) and
leverages the privacy-preserving nature of federated learning. By training a
compact prompt generator to boost the performance of the VLM deployed across
different farms, VLLFL preserves privacy while reducing communication overhead.
Experimental results demonstrate that VLLFL achieves 14.53% improvement in the
performance of VLM while reducing 99.3% communication overhead. Spanning tasks
from identifying a wide variety of fruits to detecting harmful animals in
agriculture, the proposed framework offers an efficient, scalable, and
privacy-preserving solution specifically tailored to agricultural applications.

Motivation: 现有的大规模文本到图像生成系统设计过于通用，输出可能缺乏创意多样性，且交互方式对初学者不友好，无法满足创意用户在多样化、个性化方面的需求。

Method: POET通过三个步骤实现：(1) 自动发现生成模型的同质性维度，(2) 扩展这些维度以多样化输出，(3) 学习用户反馈以个性化扩展。

Result: 28名用户的评估显示，POET能生成更高多样性的结果，帮助用户在更少的提示下达到满意，并促使他们在共创过程中更广泛地思考可能的结果。

Conclusion: POET为未来文本到图像生成工具的交互技术提供了初步探索，支持更多元化的价值和用户在创意初期的需求。

Abstract: State-of-the-art visual generative AI tools hold immense potential to assist
users in the early ideation stages of creative tasks -- offering the ability to
generate (rather than search for) novel and unprecedented (instead of existing)
images of considerable quality that also adhere to boundless combinations of
user specifications. However, many large-scale text-to-image systems are
designed for broad applicability, yielding conventional output that may limit
creative exploration. They also employ interaction methods that may be
difficult for beginners. Given that creative end users often operate in
diverse, context-specific ways that are often unpredictable, more variation and
personalization are necessary. We introduce POET, a real-time interactive tool
that (1) automatically discovers dimensions of homogeneity in text-to-image
generative models, (2) expands these dimensions to diversify the output space
of generated images, and (3) learns from user feedback to personalize
expansions. An evaluation with 28 users spanning four creative task domains
demonstrated POET's ability to generate results with higher perceived diversity
and help users reach satisfaction in fewer prompts during creative tasks,
thereby prompting them to deliberate and reflect more on a wider range of
possible produced results during the co-creative process. Focusing on visual
creativity, POET offers a first glimpse of how interaction techniques of future
text-to-image generation tools may support and align with more pluralistic
values and the needs of end users during the ideation stages of their work.

Motivation: 地面甲虫是重要的生物多样性监测指标，但传统分类方法依赖专家手动操作，效率低。本文旨在通过自动化视觉分类解决这一问题。

Method: 在四个包含230属1769种的数据集上测试12种视觉模型，重点关注样本效率和领域适应能力。

Result: 最佳模型在属和种级别分别达到97%和94%的准确率，样本效率可提升50%，但实验室到野外图像的领域适应仍具挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为大规模甲虫自动分类奠定了基础，并推动了样本高效学习和跨领域适应技术的发展。

Abstract: Ground beetles are a highly sensitive and speciose biological indicator,
making them vital for monitoring biodiversity. However, they are currently an
underutilized resource due to the manual effort required by taxonomic experts
to perform challenging species differentiations based on subtle morphological
differences, precluding widespread applications. In this paper, we evaluate 12
vision models on taxonomic classification across four diverse, long-tailed
datasets spanning over 230 genera and 1769 species, with images ranging from
controlled laboratory settings to challenging field-collected (in-situ)
photographs. We further explore taxonomic classification in two important
real-world contexts: sample efficiency and domain adaptation. Our results show
that the Vision and Language Transformer combined with an MLP head is the best
performing model, with 97\% accuracy at genus and 94\% at species level. Sample
efficiency analysis shows that we can reduce train data requirements by up to
50\% with minimal compromise in performance. The domain adaptation experiments
reveal significant challenges when transferring models from lab to in-situ
images, highlighting a critical domain gap. Overall, our study lays a
foundation for large-scale automated taxonomic classification of beetles, and
beyond that, advances sample-efficient learning and cross-domain adaptation for
diverse long-tailed ecological datasets.

Result: 模型在危险检测和定位准确性上表现良好，同时发布了工具以支持大规模数据集管理。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了视觉语言模型的潜力，但也指出了其局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Detecting anomalous hazards in visual data, particularly in video streams, is
a critical challenge in autonomous driving. Existing models often struggle with
unpredictable, out-of-label hazards due to their reliance on predefined object
categories. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates
vision-language reasoning with zero-shot object detection to improve hazard
identification and explanation. Our pipeline consists of a Vision-Language
Model (VLM), a Large Language Model (LLM), in order to detect hazardous objects
within a traffic scene. We refine object detection by incorporating OpenAI's
CLIP model to match predicted hazards with bounding box annotations, improving
localization accuracy. To assess model performance, we create a ground truth
dataset by denoising and extending the foundational COOOL
(Challenge-of-Out-of-Label) anomaly detection benchmark dataset with complete
natural language descriptions for hazard annotations. We define a means of
hazard detection and labeling evaluation on the extended dataset using cosine
similarity. This evaluation considers the semantic similarity between the
predicted hazard description and the annotated ground truth for each video.
Additionally, we release a set of tools for structuring and managing
large-scale hazard detection datasets. Our findings highlight the strengths and
limitations of current vision-language-based approaches, offering insights into
future improvements in autonomous hazard detection systems. Our models,
scripts, and data can be found at https://github.com/mi3labucm/COOOLER.git

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细胞学在癌症诊断中至关重要，但现有深度学习模型因样本异质性、器官差异和数据稀缺而难以通用化。

Method: 使用iBOT框架（结合掩码图像建模和自蒸馏）预训练CytoFM，并在多个下游任务中评估其性能。

Result: CytoFM在两项任务中优于基于组织病理学或自然图像预训练的模型，并能关注细胞学相关特征。

Conclusion: CytoFM展示了任务无关预训练方法在细胞学数据中学习稳健特征的潜力。

Abstract: Cytology is essential for cancer diagnostics and screening due to its
minimally invasive nature. However, the development of robust deep learning
models for digital cytology is challenging due to the heterogeneity in staining
and preparation methods of samples, differences across organs, and the limited
availability of large, diverse, annotated datasets. Developing a task-specific
model for every cytology application is impractical and non-cytology-specific
foundation models struggle to generalize to tasks in this domain where the
emphasis is on cell morphology. To address these challenges, we introduce
CytoFM, the first cytology self-supervised foundation model. Using iBOT, a
self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) training framework incorporating
masked image modeling and self-distillation, we pretrain CytoFM on a diverse
collection of cytology datasets to learn robust, transferable representations.
We evaluate CytoFM on multiple downstream cytology tasks, including breast
cancer classification and cell type identification, using an attention-based
multiple instance learning framework. Our results demonstrate that CytoFM
performs better on two out of three downstream tasks than existing foundation
models pretrained on histopathology (UNI) or natural images (iBOT-Imagenet).
Visualizations of learned representations demonstrate our model is able to
attend to cytologically relevant features. Despite a small pre-training
dataset, CytoFM's promising results highlight the ability of task-agnostic
pre-training approaches to learn robust and generalizable features from
cytology data.

Result: 在三个广泛采用的数据集上表现优于现有半监督和弱监督方法。

Conclusion: ProgRoCC方法通过粗略标注和渐进式学习策略，显著提升了人群计数的效率和准确性。

Abstract: As the number of individuals in a crowd grows, enumeration-based techniques
become increasingly infeasible and their estimates increasingly unreliable. We
propose instead an estimation-based version of the problem: we label Rough
Crowd Counting that delivers better accuracy on the basis of training data that
is easier to acquire. Rough crowd counting requires only rough annotations of
the number of targets in an image, instead of the more traditional, and far
more expensive, per-target annotations. We propose an approach to the rough
crowd counting problem based on CLIP, termed ProgRoCC. Specifically, we
introduce a progressive estimation learning strategy that determines the object
count through a coarse-to-fine approach. This approach delivers answers
quickly, outperforms the state-of-the-art in semi- and weakly-supervised crowd
counting. In addition, we design a vision-language matching adapter that
optimizes key-value pairs by mining effective matches of two modalities to
refine the visual features, thereby improving the final performance. Extensive
experimental results on three widely adopted crowd counting datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Result: 在Split CIFAR-100数据集上，准确率提升6.35%，遗忘率降低3.24%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效减少了持续学习中的遗忘问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: LoRA-based continual learning represents a promising avenue for leveraging
pre-trained models in downstream continual learning tasks. Recent studies have
shown that orthogonal LoRA tuning effectively mitigates forgetting. However,
this work unveils that under orthogonal LoRA tuning, the critical parameters
for pre-tasks still change notably after learning post-tasks. To address this
problem, we directly propose freezing the most critical parameter matrices in
the Vision Transformer (ViT) for pre-tasks before learning post-tasks. In
addition, building on orthogonal LoRA tuning, we propose orthogonal LoRA
composition (LoRAC) based on QR decomposition, which may further enhance the
plasticity of our method. Elaborate ablation studies and extensive comparisons
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our results indicate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several well-known
continual learning benchmarks. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100 dataset,
our method shows a 6.35\% improvement in accuracy and a 3.24\% reduction in
forgetting compared to previous methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 该论文比较了两种解决神经网络频谱偏差的技术：傅里叶特征编码（FFE）和多网格参数编码（MPE），发现MPE在细节学习和性能提升上优于FFE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在低维映射中无法学习高频信息的问题。

Method: 使用神经切线核（NTK）分析FFE和MPE的性能差异，并通过实验验证。

Result: MPE在PSNR和MS-SSIM指标上显著优于FFE和基线方法。

Conclusion: MPE通过其网格结构而非嵌入空间提升性能，机制与FFE不同，且效果更优。

Abstract: Neural networks that map between low dimensional spaces are ubiquitous in
computer graphics and scientific computing; however, in their naive
implementation, they are unable to learn high frequency information. We present
a comprehensive analysis comparing the two most common techniques for
mitigating this spectral bias: Fourier feature encodings (FFE) and multigrid
parametric encodings (MPE). FFEs are seen as the standard for low dimensional
mappings, but MPEs often outperform them and learn representations with higher
resolution and finer detail. FFE's roots in the Fourier transform, make it
susceptible to aliasing if pushed too far, while MPEs, which use a learned grid
structure, have no such limitation. To understand the difference in
performance, we use the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to evaluate these encodings
through the lens of an analogous kernel regression. By finding a lower bound on
the smallest eigenvalue of the NTK, we prove that MPEs improve a network's
performance through the structure of their grid and not their learnable
embedding. This mechanism is fundamentally different from FFEs, which rely
solely on their embedding space to improve performance. Results are empirically
validated on a 2D image regression task using images taken from 100 synonym
sets of ImageNet and 3D implicit surface regression on objects from the
Stanford graphics dataset. Using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and
multiscale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) to evaluate how well fine details
are learned, we show that the MPE increases the minimum eigenvalue by 8 orders
of magnitude over the baseline and 2 orders of magnitude over the FFE. The
increase in spectrum corresponds to a 15 dB (PSNR) / 0.65 (MS-SSIM) increase
over baseline and a 12 dB (PSNR) / 0.33 (MS-SSIM) increase over the FFE.

Conclusion: 结合单目几何先验的方法显著提高了多视图3D重建的鲁棒性和质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven geometric multi-view 3D reconstruction
foundation models (e.g., DUSt3R) have shown remarkable performance across
various 3D vision tasks, facilitated by the release of large-scale,
high-quality 3D datasets. However, as we observed, constrained by their
matching-based principles, the reconstruction quality of existing models
suffers significant degradation in challenging regions with limited matching
cues, particularly in weakly textured areas and low-light conditions. To
mitigate these limitations, we propose to harness the inherent robustness of
monocular geometry estimation to compensate for the inherent shortcomings of
matching-based methods. Specifically, we introduce a monocular-guided
refinement module that integrates monocular geometric priors into multi-view
reconstruction frameworks. This integration substantially enhances the
robustness of multi-view reconstruction systems, leading to high-quality
feed-forward reconstructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in
both mutli-view camera pose estimation and point cloud accuracy.

Result: 在四个基准测试中达到最优性能，参数和计算成本降低。

Conclusion: HSACNet通过多尺度特征和一致性策略，有效提升了半监督变化检测的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised change detection (SSCD) aims to detect changes between
bi-temporal remote sensing images by utilizing limited labeled data and
abundant unlabeled data. Existing methods struggle in complex scenarios,
exhibiting poor performance when confronted with noisy data. They typically
neglect intra-layer multi-scale features while emphasizing inter-layer fusion,
harming the integrity of change objects with different scales. In this paper,
we propose HSACNet, a Hierarchical Scale-Aware Consistency regularized Network
for SSCD. Specifically, we integrate Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), using its
Hiera backbone as the encoder to extract inter-layer multi-scale features and
applying adapters for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Moreover, we design a
Scale-Aware Differential Attention Module (SADAM) that can precisely capture
intra-layer multi-scale change features and suppress noise. Additionally, a
dual-augmentation consistency regularization strategy is adopted to effectively
utilize the unlabeled data. Extensive experiments across four CD benchmarks
demonstrate that our HSACNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
reduced parameters and computational cost.

Conclusion: CQCD框架在无监督图像恢复中表现出色，兼具几何准确性和视觉保真度。

Abstract: The presence of inhomogeneous media between optical sensors and objects leads
to distorted imaging outputs, significantly complicating downstream
image-processing tasks. A key challenge in image restoration is the lack of
high-quality, paired-label images required for training supervised models. In
this paper, we introduce the Circular Quasi-Conformal Deturbulence (CQCD)
framework, an unsupervised approach for removing image distortions through a
circular architecture. This design ensures that the restored image remains both
geometrically accurate and visually faithful while preventing the accumulation
of incorrect estimations.The circular restoration process involves both forward
and inverse mapping. To ensure the bijectivity of the estimated non-rigid
deformations, computational quasi-conformal geometry theories are leveraged to
regularize the mapping, enforcing its homeomorphic properties. This guarantees
a well-defined transformation that preserves structural integrity and prevents
unwanted artifacts. Furthermore, tight-frame blocks are integrated to encode
distortion-sensitive features for precise recovery. To validate the performance
of our approach, we conduct evaluations on various synthetic and real-world
captured images. Experimental results demonstrate that CQCD not only
outperforms existing state-of-the-art deturbulence methods in terms of image
restoration quality but also provides highly accurate deformation field
estimations.

mainly focus on spatial feature extraction, they fundamentally overlook
temporal dependencies in surgical video streams. To address this, we present
temporal asymmetric feature propagation network, a bidirectional attention
architecture enabling cross-frame feature propagation. The proposed method
contains a temporal query propagator that integrates multi-directional
consistency constraints to enhance frame-specific feature representation, and
an aggregated asymmetric feature pyramid module that preserves discriminative
features for anatomical structures and surgical instruments. Our framework
uniquely enables both temporal guidance and contextual reasoning for surgical
scene understanding. Comprehensive evaluations on two public benchmarks show
the proposed method outperforms the current SOTA methods by a large margin,
with +16.4\% mIoU on EndoVis2018 and +3.3\% mAP on Endoscapes2023. The code
will be publicly available after paper acceptance.

Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion plays a critical role in environmental
monitoring, enabling the estimation of key ecological variables such as
vegetation indices, canopy structure, and carbon stock. Although vision
foundation models have achieved remarkable progress in classification and
segmentation tasks, their application to physically interpretable regression
remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the multi-spectral nature and
geospatial heterogeneity of remote sensing data pose significant challenges for
generalization and transferability. To address these issues, we introduce
SatelliteCalculator, the first vision foundation model tailored for
quantitative remote sensing inversion. By leveraging physically defined index
formulas, we automatically construct a large-scale dataset of over one million
paired samples across eight core ecological indicators. The model integrates a
frozen Swin Transformer backbone with a prompt-guided architecture, featuring
cross-attentive adapters and lightweight task-specific MLP decoders.
Experiments on the Open-Canopy benchmark demonstrate that SatelliteCalculator
achieves competitive accuracy across all tasks while significantly reducing
inference cost. Our results validate the feasibility of applying foundation
models to quantitative inversion, and provide a scalable framework for
task-adaptive remote sensing estimation.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的迭代优化模型，用于高精度地面位移测量，解决了传统方法在亚像素精度和小位移估计上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面位移测量对地质研究至关重要，但传统方法（如光学卫星图像的块匹配）难以满足亚像素精度和小位移估计的需求，且缺乏真实地面真值数据。

Method: 采用迭代优化模型，结合显式变形层和非相关主干网络，实现亚像素精度；引入非凸总变差正则化以保持断层线锐度。

Result: 模型在半合成基准测试中显著优于常用地球物理方法，并在中高分辨率传感器的真实场景中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该模型为地面变形分析提供了高精度解决方案，适用于复杂地质和人为变化场景。

Abstract: Dense ground displacement measurements are crucial for geological studies but
are impractical to collect directly. Traditionally, displacement fields are
estimated using patch matching on optical satellite images from different
acquisition times. While deep learning-based optical flow models are promising,
their adoption in ground deformation analysis is hindered by challenges such as
the absence of real ground truth, the need for sub-pixel precision, and
temporal variations due to geological or anthropogenic changes. In particular,
we identify that deep learning models relying on explicit correlation layers
struggle at estimating small displacements in real-world conditions. Instead,
we propose a model that employs iterative refinements with explicit warping
layers and a correlation-independent backbone, enabling sub-pixel precision.
Additionally, a non-convex variant of Total Variation regularization preserves
fault-line sharpness while maintaining smoothness elsewhere. Our model
significantly outperforms widely used geophysics methods on semi-synthetic
benchmarks and generalizes well to challenging real-world scenarios captured by
both medium- and high-resolution sensors. Project page:

Result: 生物启发的传感器在性能上优于传统事件相机，同时减少了事件带宽。

Conclusion: RGC启发的事件传感器在边缘设备等低功耗实时应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Inspired by the data-efficient spiking mechanism of neurons in the human eye,
event cameras were created to achieve high temporal resolution with minimal
power and bandwidth requirements by emitting asynchronous, per-pixel intensity
changes rather than conventional fixed-frame rate images. Unlike retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs) in the human eye, however, which integrate signals from
multiple photoreceptors within a receptive field to extract spatio-temporal
features, conventional event cameras do not leverage local spatial context when
deciding which events to fire. Moreover, the eye contains around 20 different
kinds of RGCs operating in parallel, each attuned to different features or
conditions. Inspired by this biological design, we introduce Neural Ganglion
Sensors, an extension of traditional event cameras that learns task-specific
spatio-temporal retinal kernels (i.e., RGC "events"). We evaluate our design on
two challenging tasks: video interpolation and optical flow. Our results
demonstrate that our biologically inspired sensing improves performance
relative to conventional event cameras while reducing overall event bandwidth.
These findings highlight the promise of RGC-inspired event sensors for edge
devices and other low-power, real-time applications requiring efficient,
high-resolution visual streams.

Result: 在GRSS数据融合竞赛中取得第一名，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了SAR图像分割的准确性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of SAR images has garnered significant attention in
remote sensing due to the immunity of SAR sensors to cloudy weather and light
conditions. Nevertheless, SAR imagery lacks detailed information and is plagued
by significant speckle noise, rendering the annotation or segmentation of SAR
images a formidable task. Recent efforts have resorted to annotating paired
optical-SAR images to generate pseudo-labels through the utilization of an
optical image segmentation network. However, these pseudo-labels are laden with
noise, leading to suboptimal performance in SAR image segmentation. In this
study, we introduce a more precise method for generating pseudo-labels by
incorporating semi-supervised learning alongside a novel image resolution
alignment augmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a symmetric cross-entropy
loss to mitigate the impact of noisy pseudo-labels. Additionally, a bag of
training and testing tricks is utilized to generate better land-cover mapping
results. Our experiments on the GRSS data fusion contest indicate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves first place. The code is

Method: 设计了一个结合文本语义的少样本学习框架，包括语义感知的文本-视觉对齐模块和Chain-of-Thought推理方法，利用VLM和LLM生成描述文本。

Result: 在ActivityNet1.3和THUMOS14数据集上表现优异，并探索了人类异常检测的应用。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著优于现有方法，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts
of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by
using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories.
However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level
information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable
semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new
few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual
reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel
few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to
enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations,
which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align
the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express
the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the
textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought
(CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model
(VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for
videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual
features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available
ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named
Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task
in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance
and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.

Conclusion: HMPE及相关模块有效提升了小目标检测性能，同时降低了计算开销，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Current Transformer-based methods for small object detection continue
emerging, yet they have still exhibited significant shortcomings. This paper
introduces HeatMap Position Embedding (HMPE), a novel Transformer Optimization
technique that enhances object detection performance by dynamically integrating
positional encoding with semantic detection information through heatmap-guided
adaptive learning.We also innovatively visualize the HMPE method, offering
clear visualization of embedded information for parameter fine-tuning.We then
create Multi-Scale ObjectBox-Heatmap Fusion Encoder (MOHFE) and HeatMap Induced
High-Quality Queries for Decoder (HIDQ) modules. These are designed for the
encoder and decoder, respectively, to generate high-quality queries and reduce
background noise queries.Using both heatmap embedding and Linear-Snake
Conv(LSConv) feature engineering, we enhance the embedding of massively diverse
small object categories and reduced the decoder multihead layers, thereby
accelerating both inference and training.In the generalization experiments, our
approach outperforme the baseline mAP by 1.9% on the small object dataset (NWPU
VHR-10) and by 1.2% on the general dataset (PASCAL VOC). By employing
HMPE-enhanced embedding, we are able to reduce the number of decoder layers
from eight to a minimum of three, significantly decreasing both inference and
training costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成和编辑中因随机噪声导致多样性，用户需反复调整种子或提示，效率低下。现有种子选择方法依赖外部验证器且计算复杂。

Method: 提出ELECT框架，通过早期时间步评估背景不一致性选择可靠种子，保留背景并修改前景，同时集成到指令引导编辑和多模态大语言模型中。

Result: ELECT平均减少41%计算成本，最高达61%，提升背景一致性和指令遵循性，在40%的失败案例中成功。

Conclusion: ELECT无需外部监督或训练，显著提升扩散模型编辑的效率和效果。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion models, achieving reliable image
generation and editing remains challenging due to the inherent diversity
induced by stochastic noise in the sampling process. Instruction-guided image
editing with diffusion models offers user-friendly capabilities, yet editing
failures, such as background distortion, frequently occur. Users often resort
to trial and error, adjusting seeds or prompts to achieve satisfactory results,
which is inefficient. While seed selection methods exist for Text-to-Image
(T2I) generation, they depend on external verifiers, limiting applicability,
and evaluating multiple seeds increases computational complexity. To address
this, we first establish a multiple-seed-based image editing baseline using
background consistency scores, achieving Best-of-N performance without
supervision. Building on this, we introduce ELECT (Early-timestep Latent
Evaluation for Candidate Selection), a zero-shot framework that selects
reliable seeds by estimating background mismatches at early diffusion
timesteps, identifying the seed that retains the background while modifying
only the foreground. ELECT ranks seed candidates by a background inconsistency
score, filtering unsuitable samples early based on background consistency while
preserving editability. Beyond standalone seed selection, ELECT integrates into
instruction-guided editing pipelines and extends to Multimodal Large-Language
Models (MLLMs) for joint seed and prompt selection, further improving results
when seed selection alone is insufficient. Experiments show that ELECT reduces
computational costs (by 41 percent on average and up to 61 percent) while
improving background consistency and instruction adherence, achieving around 40
percent success rates in previously failed cases - without any external
supervision or training.

Result: USM的计算开销更低，速度快，内存需求少，且在图像质量上优于Zigma。FID分数在多个数据集上显著提升。

Conclusion: USM是一种高效且可扩展的扩散模型解决方案，降低了高质量图像合成的计算成本。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become the most popular approach for high-quality image
generation, but their high computational cost still remains a significant
challenge. To address this problem, we propose U-Shape Mamba (USM), a novel
diffusion model that leverages Mamba-based layers within a U-Net-like
hierarchical structure. By progressively reducing sequence length in the
encoder and restoring it in the decoder through Mamba blocks, USM significantly
lowers computational overhead while maintaining strong generative capabilities.
Experimental results against Zigma, which is currently the most efficient
Mamba-based diffusion model, demonstrate that USM achieves one-third the
GFlops, requires less memory and is faster, while outperforming Zigma in image
quality. Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is improved by 15.3, 0.84 and 2.7
points on AFHQ, CelebAHQ and COCO datasets, respectively. These findings
highlight USM as a highly efficient and scalable solution for diffusion-based
generative models, making high-quality image synthesis more accessible to the
research community while reducing computational costs.

Motivation: 甲骨文（OBI）因长期自然风化和人为破坏严重退化，传统方法计算开销大且效果有限，亟需一种高效去噪方法以辅助自动识别。

Method: 提出OBIFormer框架，利用通道自注意力、字形提取和选择性核特征融合技术，实现高效去噪。

Conclusion: OBIFormer为甲骨文图像去噪提供了一种高效且精确的解决方案，有望推动甲骨文自动识别的研究。

Abstract: Oracle bone inscriptions (OBIs) are the earliest known form of Chinese
characters and serve as a valuable resource for research in anthropology and
archaeology. However, most excavated fragments are severely degraded due to
thousands of years of natural weathering, corrosion, and man-made destruction,
making automatic OBI recognition extremely challenging. Previous methods either
focus on pixel-level information or utilize vanilla transformers for
glyph-based OBI denoising, which leads to tremendous computational overhead.
Therefore, this paper proposes a fast attentive denoising framework for oracle
bone inscriptions, i.e., OBIFormer. It leverages channel-wise self-attention,
glyph extraction, and selective kernel feature fusion to reconstruct denoised
images precisely while being computationally efficient. Our OBIFormer achieves
state-of-the-art denoising performance for PSNR and SSIM metrics on synthetic
and original OBI datasets. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments on a real
oracle dataset demonstrate the great potential of our OBIFormer in assisting
automatic OBI recognition. The code will be made available at

Conclusion: EG-Gaussian通过改进初始化和特征细化，有效提升了3D场景重建的质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore an open research problem concerning the
reconstruction of 3D scenes from images. Recent methods have adopt 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) to produce 3D scenes due to its efficient training process.
However, these methodologies may generate incomplete 3D scenes or blurred
multiviews. This is because of (1) inaccurate 3DGS point initialization and (2)
the tendency of 3DGS to flatten 3D Gaussians with the sparse-view input. To
address these issues, we propose a novel framework EG-Gaussian, which utilizes
epipolar geometry and graph networks for 3D scene reconstruction. Initially, we
integrate epipolar geometry into the 3DGS initialization phase to enhance
initial 3DGS point construction. Then, we specifically design a graph learning
module to refine 3DGS spatial features, in which we incorporate both spatial
coordinates and angular relationships among neighboring points. Experiments on
indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves reconstruction accuracy compared to 3DGS-based methods.

Conclusion: CSM为模型校准提供了更有效的数据增强和标注方法。

Abstract: Model calibration seeks to ensure that models produce confidence scores that
accurately reflect the true likelihood of their predictions being correct.
However, existing calibration approaches are fundamentally tied to datasets of
one-hot labels implicitly assuming full certainty in all the annotations. Such
datasets are effective for classification but provides insufficient knowledge
of uncertainty for model calibration, necessitating the curation of datasets
with numerically rich ground-truth confidence values. However, due to the
scarcity of uncertain visual examples, such samples are not easily available as
real datasets. In this paper, we introduce calibration-aware data augmentation
to create synthetic datasets of diverse samples and their ground-truth
uncertainty. Specifically, we present Calibration-aware Semantic Mixing (CSM),
a novel framework that generates training samples with mixed class
characteristics and annotates them with distinct confidence scores via
diffusion models. Based on this framework, we propose calibrated reannotation
to tackle the misalignment between the annotated confidence score and the
mixing ratio during the diffusion reverse process. Besides, we explore the loss
functions that better fit the new data representation paradigm. Experimental
results demonstrate that CSM achieves superior calibration compared to the
state-of-the-art calibration approaches. Code is available at

Abstract: 3D scene perception demands a large amount of adverse-weather LiDAR data, yet
the cost of LiDAR data collection presents a significant scaling-up challenge.
To this end, a series of LiDAR simulators have been proposed. Yet, they can
only simulate a single adverse weather with a single physical model, and the
fidelity of the generated data is quite limited. This paper presents
WeatherGen, the first unified diverse-weather LiDAR data diffusion generation
framework, significantly improving fidelity. Specifically, we first design a
map-based data producer, which can provide a vast amount of high-quality
diverse-weather data for training purposes. Then, we utilize the
diffusion-denoising paradigm to construct a diffusion model. Among them, we
propose a spider mamba generator to restore the disturbed diverse weather data
gradually. The spider mamba models the feature interactions by scanning the
LiDAR beam circle or central ray, excellently maintaining the physical
structure of the LiDAR data. Subsequently, following the generator to transfer
real-world knowledge, we design a latent feature aligner. Afterward, we devise
a contrastive learning-based controller, which equips weather control signals
with compact semantic knowledge through language supervision, guiding the
diffusion model to generate more discriminative data. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate the high generation quality of WeatherGen. Through WeatherGen, we
construct the mini-weather dataset, promoting the performance of the downstream
task under adverse weather conditions. Code is available:

Result: 在NYUDepthv2和SUN-RGBD数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HDBFormer通过区分处理RGB和深度图像，有效整合了两种模态的信息，提升了语义分割性能。

Abstract: In RGB-D semantic segmentation for indoor scenes, a key challenge is
effectively integrating the rich color information from RGB images with the
spatial distance information from depth images. However, most existing methods
overlook the inherent differences in how RGB and depth images express
information. Properly distinguishing the processing of RGB and depth images is
essential to fully exploiting their unique and significant characteristics. To
address this, we propose a novel heterogeneous dual-branch framework called
HDBFormer, specifically designed to handle these modality differences. For RGB
images, which contain rich detail, we employ both a basic and detail encoder to
extract local and global features. For the simpler depth images, we propose
LDFormer, a lightweight hierarchical encoder that efficiently extracts depth
features with fewer parameters. Additionally, we introduce the Modality
Information Interaction Module (MIIM), which combines transformers with large
kernel convolutions to interact global and local information across modalities
efficiently. Extensive experiments show that HDBFormer achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the NYUDepthv2 and SUN-RGBD datasets. The code

retrieval of synthetic CAD models, and show that data generated by such methods
can be used as high-quality ground truth for training supervised deep learning
models. More exactly, we employ a pipeline akin to the one previously used to
automatically annotate objects in ScanNet scenes with their 9D poses and CAD
models. This time, we apply it to the recent ScanNet++ v1 dataset, which
previously lacked such annotations. Our findings demonstrate that it is not
only possible to train deep learning models on these automatically-obtained
annotations but that the resulting models outperform those trained on manually
annotated data. We validate this on two distinct tasks: point cloud completion
and single-view CAD model retrieval and alignment. Our results underscore the
potential of automatic 3D annotations to enhance model performance while
significantly reducing annotation costs. To support future research in 3D scene
understanding, we will release our annotations, which we call SCANnotate++,
along with our trained models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D场景理解依赖手工标注，现有开放词汇方法难以扩展到城市规模数据集。

Result: 成功应用于SensatUrban数据集，展示了无需手工标注的开放词汇场景理解能力。

Conclusion: HAEC为密集城市3D场景处理提供了新思路，推动了数字孪生技术的发展。

Abstract: Traditional 3D scene understanding techniques are generally predicated on
hand-annotated label sets, but in recent years a new class of open-vocabulary
3D scene understanding techniques has emerged. Despite the success of this
paradigm on small scenes, existing approaches cannot scale efficiently to
city-scale 3D datasets. In this paper, we present Hierarchical vocab-Agnostic
Expert Clustering (HAEC), after the latin word for 'these', a superpoint graph
clustering based approach which utilizes a novel mixture of experts graph
transformer for its backbone. We administer this highly scalable approach to
the first application of open-vocabulary scene understanding on the SensatUrban
city-scale dataset. We also demonstrate a synthetic labeling pipeline which is
derived entirely from the raw point clouds with no hand-annotation. Our
technique can help unlock complex operations on dense urban 3D scenes and open
a new path forward in the processing of digital twins.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: PointKAN基于KANs提出了一种高效的点云分析方法，通过几何仿射模块和局部特征处理提升特征表示能力，显著减少了参数和计算量，并在多个基准数据集上优于PointMLP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLPs在点云分析中难以高效捕捉局部几何特征，且存在参数冗余问题，因此需要一种更高效的架构。

Method: 提出PointKAN，结合几何仿射模块（GAM）和局部特征处理（LFP），逐步扩展感受野，并开发高效的Efficient-KANs以减少参数。

Result: PointKAN在ModelNet40等数据集上表现优于PointMLP，尤其在Few-shot Learning任务中，同时显著降低了参数和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: KANs架构在3D视觉中具有潜力，为点云理解研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) have become one of the fundamental
architectural component in point cloud analysis due to its effective feature
learning mechanism. However, when processing complex geometric structures in
point clouds, MLPs' fixed activation functions struggle to efficiently capture
local geometric features, while suffering from poor parameter efficiency and
high model redundancy. In this paper, we propose PointKAN, which applies
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to point cloud analysis tasks to investigate
their efficacy in hierarchical feature representation. First, we introduce a
Geometric Affine Module (GAM) to transform local features, improving the
model's robustness to geometric variations. Next, in the Local Feature
Processing (LFP), a parallel structure extracts both group-level features and
global context, providing a rich representation of both fine details and
overall structure. Finally, these features are combined and processed in the
Global Feature Processing (GFP). By repeating these operations, the receptive
field gradually expands, enabling the model to capture complete geometric
information of the point cloud. To overcome the high parameter counts and
computational inefficiency of standard KANs, we develop Efficient-KANs in the
PointKAN-elite variant, which significantly reduces parameters while
maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that PointKAN
outperforms PointMLP on benchmark datasets such as ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN,
and ShapeNetPart, with particularly strong performance in Few-shot Learning
task. Additionally, PointKAN achieves substantial reductions in parameter
counts and computational complexity (FLOPs). This work highlights the potential
of KANs-based architectures in 3D vision and opens new avenues for research in
point cloud understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略历史遍历信息，而LMPOcc利用长期记忆先验增强感知能力。

Method: 提出插拔式架构和Current-Prior Fusion模块，兼容多种基线模型。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes基准测试中表现最佳，尤其静态语义类别。

Conclusion: LMPOcc通过多车众包构建全局占用，验证了长期记忆先验的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is critical for autonomous
driving, enabling unified modeling of static infrastructure and dynamic agents.
In practice, autonomous vehicles may repeatedly traverse identical geographic
locations under varying environmental conditions, such as weather fluctuations
and illumination changes. Existing methods in 3D occupancy prediction
predominantly integrate adjacent temporal contexts. However, these works
neglect to leverage perceptual information, which is acquired from historical
traversals of identical geographic locations. In this paper, we propose
Longterm Memory Prior Occupancy (LMPOcc), the first 3D occupancy prediction
methodology that exploits long-term memory priors derived from historical
traversal perceptual outputs. We introduce a plug-and-play architecture that
integrates long-term memory priors to enhance local perception while
simultaneously constructing global occupancy representations. To adaptively
aggregate prior features and current features, we develop an efficient
lightweight Current-Prior Fusion module. Moreover, we propose a model-agnostic
prior format to ensure compatibility across diverse occupancy prediction
baselines. LMPOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance validated on the
Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, especially on static semantic categories.
Additionally, experimental results demonstrate LMPOcc's ability to construct
global occupancy through multi-vehicle crowdsourcing.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: FocusTrack提出了一种动态调整搜索区域和增强特征表示的新框架，平衡计算效率和跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决抗无人机跟踪中目标小、相机运动剧烈和背景复杂的问题，同时优化局部和全局跟踪器的性能差距。

Method: 提出Search Region Adjustment (SRA)策略动态调整搜索区域，以及Attention-to-Mask (ATM)模块增强特征表示。

Result: FocusTrack在AntiUAV和AntiUAV410数据集上分别达到67.7%和62.8% AUC，计算效率高（30G MACs，143 fps）。

Conclusion: FocusTrack在精度和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于实时跟踪场景。

Abstract: Anti-UAV tracking poses significant challenges, including small target sizes,
abrupt camera motion, and cluttered infrared backgrounds. Existing tracking
paradigms can be broadly categorized into global- and local-based methods.
Global-based trackers, such as SiamDT, achieve high accuracy by scanning the
entire field of view but suffer from excessive computational overhead, limiting
real-world deployment. In contrast, local-based methods, including OSTrack and
ROMTrack, efficiently restrict the search region but struggle when targets
undergo significant displacements due to abrupt camera motion. Through
preliminary experiments, it is evident that a local tracker, when paired with
adaptive search region adjustment, can significantly enhance tracking accuracy,
narrowing the gap between local and global trackers. To address this challenge,
we propose FocusTrack, a novel framework that dynamically refines the search
region and strengthens feature representations, achieving an optimal balance
between computational efficiency and tracking accuracy. Specifically, our
Search Region Adjustment (SRA) strategy estimates the target presence
probability and adaptively adjusts the field of view, ensuring the target
remains within focus. Furthermore, to counteract feature degradation caused by
varying search regions, the Attention-to-Mask (ATM) module is proposed. This
module integrates hierarchical information, enriching the target
representations with fine-grained details. Experimental results demonstrate
that FocusTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, obtaining 67.7% AUC on
AntiUAV and 62.8% AUC on AntiUAV410, outperforming the baseline tracker by 8.5%
and 9.1% AUC, respectively. In terms of efficiency, FocusTrack surpasses
global-based trackers, requiring only 30G MACs and achieving 143 fps with
FocusTrack (SRA) and 44 fps with the full version, both enabling real-time
tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖额外标注，忽略了树层次结构中蕴含的层次标签关系信息，希望通过利用这些信息提升分类性能。

Method: 设计了CHBC框架，通过模块分解和增强注意力掩码与特征，并采用双向一致性损失调节不同层次的分类结果。

Result: 在三个常用FGVC数据集上验证了CHBC的有效性，消融实验进一步证明了特征增强和一致性约束的贡献。

Conclusion: CHBC框架通过利用树层次结构和双向一致性学习，显著提升了细粒度视觉分类的性能。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) aims to categorize closely related
subclasses, a task complicated by minimal inter-class differences and
significant intra-class variance. Existing methods often rely on additional
annotations for image classification, overlooking the valuable information
embedded in Tree Hierarchies that depict hierarchical label relationships. To
leverage this knowledge to improve classification accuracy and consistency, we
propose a novel Cross-Hierarchical Bidirectional Consistency Learning (CHBC)
framework. The CHBC framework extracts discriminative features across various
hierarchies using a specially designed module to decompose and enhance
attention masks and features. We employ bidirectional consistency loss to
regulate the classification outcomes across different hierarchies, ensuring
label prediction consistency and reducing misclassification. Experiments on
three widely used FGVC datasets validate the effectiveness of the CHBC
framework. Ablation studies further investigate the application strategies of
feature enhancement and consistency constraints, underscoring the significant
contributions of the proposed modules.

Motivation: 探索利用大语言模型直接从多模态数据中生成结构化视觉表示（如场景图）的潜力。

Result: 强化学习显著提升模型性能，实现零失败率，优于仅用监督微调的方法。

Conclusion: R1-SGG展示了强化学习在结构化视觉表示生成任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Next token prediction is the fundamental principle for training large
language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their
reasoning performance. As an effective way to model language, image, video, and
other modalities, the use of LLMs for end-to-end extraction of structured
visual representations, such as scene graphs, remains underexplored. It
requires the model to accurately produce a set of objects and relationship
triplets, rather than generating text token by token. To achieve this, we
introduce R1-SGG, a multimodal LLM (M-LLM) initially trained via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on the scene graph dataset and subsequently refined using
reinforcement learning to enhance its ability to generate scene graphs in an
end-to-end manner. The SFT follows a conventional prompt-response paradigm,
while RL requires the design of effective reward signals. Given the structured
nature of scene graphs, we design a graph-centric reward function that
integrates node-level rewards, edge-level rewards, and a format consistency
reward. Our experiments demonstrate that rule-based RL substantially enhances
model performance in the SGG task, achieving a zero failure rate--unlike
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize effectively. Our
code is available at https://github.com/gpt4vision/R1-SGG.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对第三人称视角和显式对象查询，而AI助手等应用需要处理以自我为中心的视角和隐式意图。

Method: 提出了EgoIntention数据集和RoG指令调优方法，结合意图推理和对象定位机制进行混合训练。

Result: RoG在EgoIntention数据集上表现优于传统方法，同时保持了显式描述定位的能力。

Conclusion: RoG方法实现了对以自我为中心和第三人称视角的统一处理，并能同时处理显式对象查询和隐式意图。

Abstract: Visual grounding associates textual descriptions with objects in an image.
Conventional methods target third-person image inputs and named object queries.
In applications such as AI assistants, the perspective shifts -- inputs are
egocentric, and objects may be referred to implicitly through needs and
intentions. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoIntention, the first dataset
for egocentric visual intention grounding. EgoIntention challenges multimodal
LLMs to 1) understand and ignore unintended contextual objects and 2) reason
about uncommon object functionalities. Benchmark results show that current
models misidentify context objects and lack affordance understanding in
egocentric views. We also propose Reason-to-Ground (RoG) instruction tuning; it
enables hybrid training with normal descriptions and egocentric intentions with
a chained intention reasoning and object grounding mechanism. RoG significantly
outperforms naive finetuning and hybrid training on EgoIntention, while
maintaining or slightly improving naive description grounding. This advancement
enables unified visual grounding for egocentric and exocentric visual inputs
while handling explicit object queries and implicit human intentions.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为DenSe-AdViT的新型Vision Transformer，用于解决SAR图像中密集小目标检测的问题，通过密度感知模块和多尺度融合模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT在SAR图像目标检测中表现优异，但难以提取多尺度局部特征，导致小目标检测性能受限，尤其是在密集分布时。

Method: 设计了密度感知模块（DAM）生成密度张量，并提出了密度增强融合模块（DEFM）结合CNN的多尺度信息和Transformer的全局特征。

Result: 在RSDD和SIVED数据集上分别达到79.8%和92.5%的mAP。

Conclusion: DenSe-AdViT有效解决了密集小目标检测问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable results in object detection
for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, owing to its exceptional ability to
extract global features. However, it struggles with the extraction of
multi-scale local features, leading to limited performance in detecting small
targets, especially when they are densely arranged. Therefore, we propose
Density-Sensitive Vision Transformer with Adaptive Tokens (DenSe-AdViT) for
dense SAR target detection. We design a Density-Aware Module (DAM) as a
preliminary component that generates a density tensor based on target
distribution. It is guided by a meticulously crafted objective metric, enabling
precise and effective capture of the spatial distribution and density of
objects. To integrate the multi-scale information enhanced by convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) with the global features derived from the Transformer,
Density-Enhanced Fusion Module (DEFM) is proposed. It effectively refines
attention toward target-survival regions with the assist of density mask and
the multiple sources features. Notably, our DenSe-AdViT achieves 79.8% mAP on
the RSDD dataset and 92.5% on the SIVED dataset, both of which feature a large
number of densely distributed vehicle targets.

TLDR: 提出了一种参数高效的多模态适应框架PEMMA，用于将仅基于CT扫描训练的模型轻量级升级为可适应PET扫描的模型，同时支持预后任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CT-PET数据依赖性问题，因PET扫描稀缺，需灵活框架以CT训练并适应PET。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的模型（UNETR和Swin UNETR），通过低秩适应（LoRA）和分解低秩适应（DoRA）实现参数高效适应。

Result: 性能与早期融合相当，但仅需8%可训练参数；PET扫描Dice分数提升28%；预后任务中一致性指数提升10%（CT→PET）和23%（CT→PET+EHR）。

Conclusion: PEMMA框架高效灵活，显著提升多模态适应性能，减少参数需求。

Abstract: Cancer detection and prognosis relies heavily on medical imaging,
particularly CT and PET scans. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown promise
in tumor segmentation by fusing information from these modalities. However, a
critical bottleneck exists: the dependency on CT-PET data concurrently for
training and inference, posing a challenge due to the limited availability of
PET scans. Hence, there is a clear need for a flexible and efficient framework
that can be trained with the widely available CT scans and can be still adapted
for PET scans when they become available. In this work, we propose a
parameter-efficient multi-modal adaptation (PEMMA) framework for lightweight
upgrading of a transformer-based segmentation model trained only on CT scans
such that it can be efficiently adapted for use with PET scans when they become
available. This framework is further extended to perform prognosis task
maintaining the same efficient cross-modal fine-tuning approach. The proposed
approach is tested with two well-known segementation backbones, namely UNETR
and Swin UNETR. Our approach offers two main advantages. Firstly, we leverage
the inherent modularity of the transformer architecture and perform low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) as well as decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) of the
attention weights to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Secondly, by
minimizing cross-modal entanglement, PEMMA allows updates using only one
modality without causing catastrophic forgetting in the other. Our method
achieves comparable performance to early fusion, but with only 8% of the
trainable parameters, and demonstrates a significant +28% Dice score
improvement on PET scans when trained with a single modality. Furthermore, in
prognosis, our method improves the concordance index by +10% when adapting a
CT-pretrained model to include PET scans, and by +23% when adapting for both
PET and EHR data.

Abstract: Road anomaly detection plays a crucial role in road maintenance and in
enhancing the safety of both drivers and vehicles. Recent machine learning
approaches for road anomaly detection have overcome the tedious and
time-consuming process of manual analysis and anomaly counting; however, they
often fall short in providing a complete characterization of road potholes. In
this paper, we leverage transfer learning by adopting a pre-trained YOLOv8-seg
model for the automatic characterization of potholes using digital images
captured from a dashboard-mounted camera. Our work includes the creation of a
novel dataset, comprising both images and their corresponding depth maps,
collected from diverse road environments in Al-Khobar city and the KFUPM campus
in Saudi Arabia. Our approach performs pothole detection and segmentation to
precisely localize potholes and calculate their area. Subsequently, the
segmented image is merged with its depth map to extract detailed depth
information about the potholes. This integration of segmentation and depth data
offers a more comprehensive characterization compared to previous deep
learning-based road anomaly detection systems. Overall, this method not only
has the potential to significantly enhance autonomous vehicle navigation by
improving the detection and characterization of road hazards but also assists
road maintenance authorities in responding more effectively to road damage.

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) demonstrate significant
potential in healthcare, but their reliance on general medical data and
coarse-grained global visual understanding limits them in intelligent
ophthalmic diagnosis. Currently, intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis faces three
major challenges: (i) Data. The lack of deeply annotated, high-quality,
multi-modal ophthalmic visual instruction data; (ii) Benchmark. The absence of
a comprehensive and systematic benchmark for evaluating diagnostic performance;
(iii) Model. The difficulty of adapting holistic visual architectures to
fine-grained, region-specific ophthalmic lesion identification. In this paper,
we propose the Eyecare Kit, which systematically tackles the aforementioned
three key challenges with the tailored dataset, benchmark and model: First, we
construct a multi-agent data engine with real-life ophthalmology data to
produce Eyecare-100K, a high-quality ophthalmic visual instruction dataset.
Subsequently, we design Eyecare-Bench, a benchmark that comprehensively
evaluates the overall performance of LVLMs on intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis
tasks across multiple dimensions. Finally, we develop the EyecareGPT, optimized
for fine-grained ophthalmic visual understanding thoroughly, which incorporates
an adaptive resolution mechanism and a layer-wise dense connector. Extensive
experimental results indicate that the EyecareGPT achieves state-of-the-art
performance in a range of ophthalmic tasks, underscoring its significant
potential for the advancement of open research in intelligent ophthalmic
diagnosis. Our project is available at https://github.com/DCDmllm/EyecareGPT.

Conclusion: AnyTSR方法在热成像超分辨率任务中表现出色，适用于无人机应用。

Abstract: Thermal imaging can greatly enhance the application of intelligent unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAV) in challenging environments. However, the inherent low
resolution of thermal sensors leads to insufficient details and blurred
boundaries. Super-resolution (SR) offers a promising solution to address this
issue, while most existing SR methods are designed for fixed-scale SR. They are
computationally expensive and inflexible in practical applications. To address
above issues, this work proposes a novel any-scale thermal SR method (AnyTSR)
for UAV within a single model. Specifically, a new image encoder is proposed to
explicitly assign specific feature code to enable more accurate and flexible
representation. Additionally, by effectively embedding coordinate offset
information into the local feature ensemble, an innovative any-scale upsampler
is proposed to better understand spatial relationships and reduce artifacts.
Moreover, a novel dataset (UAV-TSR), covering both land and water scenes, is
constructed for thermal SR tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all
scaling factors as well as generates more accurate and detailed high-resolution
images. The code is located at https://github.com/vision4robotics/AnyTSR.

Method: 研究使用ImageNet-C基准的19种损坏类型，并引入TextVQA-C和GQA-C两个新基准，系统评估损坏对场景文本理解和对象推理的影响。

Result: 分析发现，Transformer模型在不同任务中表现出不同的脆弱性模式，文本识别在模糊和雪损坏下表现最差，而对象推理对霜冻和脉冲噪声更敏感。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer模型对低频处理的固有偏好如何解释其鲁棒性差异，为开发更鲁棒的视觉语言模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
understanding and reasoning about visual and textual content. However, their
robustness to common image corruptions remains under-explored. In this work, we
present the first comprehensive analysis of VLM robustness across 19 corruption
types from the ImageNet-C benchmark, spanning four categories: noise, blur,
weather, and digital distortions. We introduce two new benchmarks, TextVQA-C
and GQA-C, to systematically evaluate how corruptions affect scene text
understanding and object-based reasoning, respectively. Our analysis reveals
that transformer-based VLMs exhibit distinct vulnerability patterns across
tasks: text recognition deteriorates most severely under blur and snow
corruptions, while object reasoning shows higher sensitivity to corruptions
such as frost and impulse noise. We connect these observations to the
frequency-domain characteristics of different corruptions, revealing how
transformers' inherent bias toward low-frequency processing explains their
differential robustness patterns. Our findings provide valuable insights for
developing more corruption-robust vision-language models for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Zebrafish share a high degree of homology with human genes and are commonly
used as model organism in biomedical research. For medical laboratories,
counting zebrafish is a daily task. Due to the tiny size of zebrafish, manual
visual counting is challenging. Existing counting methods are either not
applicable to small fishes or have too many limitations. The paper proposed a
zebrafish counting algorithm based on the event stream data. Firstly, an event
camera is applied for data acquisition. Secondly, camera calibration and image
fusion were preformed successively. Then, the trajectory information was used
to improve the counting accuracy. Finally, the counting results were averaged
over an empirical of period and rounded up to get the final results. To
evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm, 20 zebrafish were put in a four-liter
breeding tank. Among 100 counting trials, the average accuracy reached 97.95%.
As compared with traditional algorithms, the proposed one offers a simpler
implementation and achieves higher accuracy.

Abstract: This work aligns deep learning (DL) with human reasoning capabilities and
needs to enable more efficient, interpretable, and robust image classification.
We approach this from three perspectives: explainability, causality, and
biological vision. Introduction and background open this work before diving
into operative chapters. First, we assess neural networks' visualization
techniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for
breast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI
and causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past
and future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the
causality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature
co-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable
predictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that
integrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and
prior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological
vision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a
connectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall,
our key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for
medical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and
radiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak
causal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve
performance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical
domains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit
motifs improves human-aligned recognition. This work contributes toward
human-aligned DL and highlights pathways to bridge the gap between research and
clinical adoption, with implications for improved trust, diagnostic accuracy,
and safe deployment.

*Lin Yuan,Xiaowan Li,Yan Zhang,Jiawei Zhang,Hongbo Li,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种基于图像熵的多粒度局部熵模式（MLEP）方法，用于检测AI生成的图像（AIGI），并在开放场景中验证了其优于现有方法的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像（AIGI）的滥用（如虚假信息和深度伪造）引发了严重担忧，现有检测方法因缺乏源不变特征和泛化能力不足而难以应对多样化生成模型和场景。

Method: 提出MLEP方法，通过计算多尺度图像块的重排熵特征图，全面捕捉像素关系并减少内容偏差，结合CNN分类器进行检测。

Result: 在32种生成模型的开放场景实验中，MLEP方法在准确性和泛化性上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MLEP为AIGI检测提供了有效的解决方案，尤其在跨模型和场景的泛化能力上表现突出。

Abstract: Advancements in image generation technologies have raised significant
concerns about their potential misuse, such as producing misinformation and
deepfakes. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective methods to detect
AI-generated images (AIGI). Despite progress in AIGI detection, achieving
reliable performance across diverse generation models and scenes remains
challenging due to the lack of source-invariant features and limited
generalization capabilities in existing methods. In this work, we explore the
potential of using image entropy as a cue for AIGI detection and propose
Multi-granularity Local Entropy Patterns (MLEP), a set of entropy feature maps
computed across shuffled small patches over multiple image scaled. MLEP
comprehensively captures pixel relationships across dimensions and scales while
significantly disrupting image semantics, reducing potential content bias.
Leveraging MLEP, a robust CNN-based classifier for AIGI detection can be
trained. Extensive experiments conducted in an open-world scenario, evaluating
images synthesized by 32 distinct generative models, demonstrate significant
improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: LimitNet是一种针对弱设备和低带宽网络设计的渐进式图像压缩模型，显著提升了部分数据传输时的推理准确性并节省带宽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT设备硬件能力有限且常部署在偏远地区，传统方法在低带宽和高丢包率的LPWANs网络中表现不佳，无法支持时间敏感的推理任务。

Method: LimitNet采用轻量级渐进式编码器，根据图像内容优先传输关键数据，使云端能在部分数据可用时进行推理。

Result: 实验显示，LimitNet在ImageNet1000、CIFAR100和COCO数据集上分别比SOTA提升了14.01%、18.01%和0.1 mAP@0.5，同时节省了61.24%、83.68%和42.25%的带宽。

Conclusion: LimitNet在弱设备和低带宽网络中表现出色，显著提升了推理准确性和带宽效率。

Abstract: IoT devices have limited hardware capabilities and are often deployed in
remote areas. Consequently, advanced vision models surpass such devices'
processing and storage capabilities, requiring offloading of such tasks to the
cloud. However, remote areas often rely on LPWANs technology with limited
bandwidth, high packet loss rates, and extremely low duty cycles, which makes
fast offloading for time-sensitive inference challenging. Today's approaches,
which are deployable on weak devices, generate a non-progressive bit stream,
and therefore, their decoding quality suffers strongly when data is only
partially available on the cloud at a deadline due to limited bandwidth or
packet losses.
  In this paper, we introduce LimitNet, a progressive, content-aware image
compression model designed for extremely weak devices and networks. LimitNet's
lightweight progressive encoder prioritizes critical data during transmission
based on the content of the image, which gives the cloud the opportunity to run
inference even with partial data availability.
  Experimental results demonstrate that LimitNet, on average, compared to SOTA,
achieves 14.01 p.p. (percentage point) higher accuracy on ImageNet1000, 18.01
pp on CIFAR100, and 0.1 higher mAP@0.5 on COCO. Also, on average, LimitNet
saves 61.24% bandwidth on ImageNet1000, 83.68% on CIFAR100, and 42.25% on the
COCO dataset compared to SOTA, while it only has 4% more encoding time compared
to JPEG (with a fixed quality) on STM32F7 (Cortex-M7).

Motivation: 解决扩散模型在文本到图像合成中空间关系渲染不足的问题，避免现有方法的高计算成本和灵活性限制。

Method: 基于LAION-400M构建空间明确的数据集，开发ESPLoRA框架和TORE算法，结合几何约束的评估指标。

Result: 在空间一致性基准上优于CoMPaSS 13.33%，同时保持生成时间和输出质量。

Conclusion: ESPLoRA和TORE算法显著提升了空间一致性，并揭示了模型的空间偏差，为未来优化提供了方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, producing
high-quality, photorealistic images. However, they still struggle to properly
render the spatial relationships described in text prompts. To address the lack
of spatial information in T2I generations, existing methods typically use
external network conditioning and predefined layouts, resulting in higher
computational costs and reduced flexibility. Our approach builds upon a curated
dataset of spatially explicit prompts, meticulously extracted and synthesized
from LAION-400M to ensure precise alignment between textual descriptions and
spatial layouts. Alongside this dataset, we present ESPLoRA, a flexible
fine-tuning framework based on Low-Rank Adaptation, specifically designed to
enhance spatial consistency in generative models without increasing generation
time or compromising the quality of the outputs. In addition to ESPLoRA, we
propose refined evaluation metrics grounded in geometric constraints, capturing
3D spatial relations such as \textit{in front of} or \textit{behind}. These
metrics also expose spatial biases in T2I models which, even when not fully
mitigated, can be strategically exploited by our TORE algorithm to further
improve the spatial consistency of generated images. Our method outperforms the
current state-of-the-art framework, CoMPaSS, by 13.33% on established spatial
consistency benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CD方法在跨域适应性上表现不佳，需大量标记数据重新训练，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出DAM-Net，结合对抗域适应（分段判别器和交替训练策略）和微标记微调（仅标记0.3%样本），并采用多时相Transformer和优化主干结构。

Result: 在LEVIR-CD和WHU-CD数据集上，DAM-Net显著优于现有域适应方法，性能接近需10%标记的半监督方法。

Conclusion: DAM-Net为遥感图像跨域CD提供了高效解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Change detection (CD) in remote sensing imagery plays a crucial role in
various applications such as urban planning, damage assessment, and resource
management. While deep learning approaches have significantly advanced CD
performance, current methods suffer from poor domain adaptability, requiring
extensive labeled data for retraining when applied to new scenarios. This
limitation severely restricts their practical applications across different
datasets. In this work, we propose DAM-Net: a Domain Adaptation Network with
Micro-Labeled Fine-Tuning for CD. Our network introduces adversarial domain
adaptation to CD for, utilizing a specially designed segmentation-discriminator
and alternating training strategy to enable effective transfer between domains.
Additionally, we propose a novel Micro-Labeled Fine-Tuning approach that
strategically selects and labels a minimal amount of samples (less than 1%) to
enhance domain adaptation. The network incorporates a Multi-Temporal
Transformer for feature fusion and optimized backbone structure based on
previous research. Experiments conducted on the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets
demonstrate that DAM-Net significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation
methods, achieving comparable performance to semi-supervised approaches that
require 10% labeled data while using only 0.3% labeled samples. Our approach
significantly advances cross-dataset CD applications and provides a new
paradigm for efficient domain adaptation in remote sensing. The source code of
DAM-Net will be made publicly available upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经母细胞瘤的诊断依赖主观人工检查，准确性不一致，现有自动化方法存在解释性差、特征提取能力有限和计算成本高等问题。

Method: 结合Swin Transformer架构和Kernel Activation Network，融合多尺度特征并利用对比学习策略，模拟临床医生的综合方法。

Result: 在PpNTs和BreakHis数据集上验证，性能优于现有最先进的病理学专用模型。

Conclusion: CMSwinKAN在病理图像分类中表现出色，具有临床实用潜力。

Abstract: Neuroblastoma, adrenal-derived, is among the most common pediatric solid
malignancies, characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity. Timely and
accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide
images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices
primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to
inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole slide image classification
methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature
extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their
practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model
tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin
Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its
multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving
both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and
leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians'
comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue
characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism
guided by clinical insights to seamlessly bridge patch-level predictions to
whole slide image-level classifications. We validate CMSwinKAN on the PpNTs
dataset, which was collaboratively established with our partner hospital and
the publicly accessible BreakHis dataset. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN
performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models
pre-trained on large datasets. Our source code is available at

TLDR: 研究探讨了基于深度隐写嵌入的脆弱水印技术，用于验证ICAO标准面部图像的完整性，通过嵌入隐藏图像作为标记，检测和分类图像篡改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代身份验证系统依赖面部图像，但图像可能因无意或恶意操作而失效，需一种机制确保其真实性。

Method: 采用深度隐写嵌入技术，在官方照片中嵌入隐藏图像作为完整性标记，分析篡改对隐藏图像的影响。

Result: 实验显示高检测准确率，包括跨方法场景，篡改痕迹可作为强健的取证线索。

Conclusion: 脆弱水印技术是验证生物特征文档完整性的有效工具。

Abstract: Modern identity verification systems increasingly rely on facial images
embedded in biometric documents such as electronic passports. To ensure global
interoperability and security, these images must comply with strict standards
defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which specify
acquisition, quality, and format requirements. However, once issued, these
images may undergo unintentional degradations (e.g., compression, resizing) or
malicious manipulations (e.g., morphing) and deceive facial recognition
systems. In this study, we explore fragile watermarking, based on deep
steganographic embedding as a proactive mechanism to certify the authenticity
of ICAO-compliant facial images. By embedding a hidden image within the
official photo at the time of issuance, we establish an integrity marker that
becomes sensitive to any post-issuance modification. We assess how a range of
image manipulations affects the recovered hidden image and show that
degradation artifacts can serve as robust forensic cues. Furthermore, we
propose a classification framework that analyzes the revealed content to detect
and categorize the type of manipulation applied. Our experiments demonstrate
high detection accuracy, including cross-method scenarios with multiple deep
steganography-based models. These findings support the viability of fragile
watermarking via steganographic embedding as a valuable tool for biometric
document integrity verification.

Motivation: 现有的Logit Lens和Diffusion Lens方法在分析视觉Transformer的内部表示时存在不足，无法捕捉子模块的直接贡献。

Result: 实验验证表明，DSL能直观可靠地解释ViT的内部处理过程。

Conclusion: DSL是一种有效的工具，能够改进对视觉Transformer内部机制的理解。

Abstract: Logit Lens is a widely adopted method for mechanistic interpretability of
transformer-based language models, enabling the analysis of how internal
representations evolve across layers by projecting them into the output
vocabulary space. Although applying Logit Lens to Vision Transformers (ViTs) is
technically straightforward, its direct use faces limitations in capturing the
richness of visual representations. Building on the work of Toker et al.
(2024)~\cite{Toker2024-ve}, who introduced Diffusion Lens to visualize
intermediate representations in the text encoders of text-to-image diffusion
models, we demonstrate that while Diffusion Lens can effectively visualize
residual stream representations in image encoders, it fails to capture the
direct contributions of individual submodules. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \textbf{Diffusion Steering Lens} (DSL), a novel, training-free approach
that steers submodule outputs and patches subsequent indirect contributions. We
validate our method through interventional studies, showing that DSL provides
an intuitive and reliable interpretation of the internal processing in ViTs.

Method: 使用ViTs和CNNs（包括UNet）在Landsat-8卫星图像数据集上进行野火检测对比实验。

Conclusion: ViTs在野火检测中表现接近CNNs，但优化后的CNNs（如UNet）仍是目前最佳选择。

Abstract: Wildfires are increasing in intensity, frequency, and duration across large
parts of the world as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Modern hazard
detection and response systems that deal with wildfires are under-equipped for
sustained wildfire seasons. Recent work has proved automated wildfire detection
using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on satellite imagery are
capable of high-accuracy results. However, CNNs are computationally expensive
to train and only incorporate local image context. Recently, Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity for their efficient training and
their ability to include both local and global contextual information. In this
work, we show that ViT can outperform well-trained and specialized CNNs to
detect wildfires on a previously published dataset of LandSat-8 imagery. One of
our ViTs outperforms the baseline CNN comparison by 0.92%. However, we find our
own implementation of CNN-based UNet to perform best in every category, showing
their sustained utility in image tasks. Overall, ViTs are comparably capable in
detecting wildfires as CNNs, though well-tuned CNNs are still the best
technique for detecting wildfire with our UNet providing an IoU of 93.58%,
better than the baseline UNet by some 4.58%.

Result: 在虚拟扫描和真实数据集上，RefComp在类感知和类无关训练设置下均取得领先或竞争性结果。

Conclusion: RefComp框架通过形状转换和潜在特征融合，显著提升了无配对点云补全的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The unpaired point cloud completion task aims to complete a partial point
cloud by using models trained with no ground truth. Existing unpaired point
cloud completion methods are class-aware, i.e., a separate model is needed for
each object class. Since they have limited generalization capabilities, these
methods perform poorly in real-world scenarios when confronted with a wide
range of point clouds of generic 3D objects. In this paper, we propose a novel
unpaired point cloud completion framework, namely the Reference-guided
Completion (RefComp) framework, which attains strong performance in both the
class-aware and class-agnostic training settings. The RefComp framework
transforms the unpaired completion problem into a shape translation problem,
which is solved in the latent feature space of the partial point clouds. To
this end, we introduce the use of partial-complete point cloud pairs, which are
retrieved by using the partial point cloud to be completed as a template. These
point cloud pairs are used as reference data to guide the completion process.
Our RefComp framework uses a reference branch and a target branch with shared
parameters for shape fusion and shape translation via a Latent Shape Fusion
Module (LSFM) to enhance the structural features along the completion pipeline.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the RefComp framework achieves not only
state-of-the-art performance in the class-aware training setting but also
competitive results in the class-agnostic training setting on both virtual
scans and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: CheXWorld为放射影像提供了一种有效的自监督世界模型，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Humans can develop internal world models that encode common sense knowledge,
telling them how the world works and predicting the consequences of their
actions. This concept has emerged as a promising direction for establishing
general-purpose machine-learning models in recent preliminary works, e.g., for
visual representation learning. In this paper, we present CheXWorld, the first
effort towards a self-supervised world model for radiographic images.
Specifically, our work develops a unified framework that simultaneously models
three aspects of medical knowledge essential for qualified radiologists,
including 1) local anatomical structures describing the fine-grained
characteristics of local tissues (e.g., architectures, shapes, and textures);
2) global anatomical layouts describing the global organization of the human
body (e.g., layouts of organs and skeletons); and 3) domain variations that
encourage CheXWorld to model the transitions across different appearance
domains of radiographs (e.g., varying clarity, contrast, and exposure caused by
collecting radiographs from different hospitals, devices, or patients).
Empirically, we design tailored qualitative and quantitative analyses,
revealing that CheXWorld successfully captures these three dimensions of
medical knowledge. Furthermore, transfer learning experiments across eight
medical image classification and segmentation benchmarks showcase that
CheXWorld significantly outperforms existing SSL methods and large-scale
medical foundation models. Code & pre-trained models are available at

Conclusion: 量子计算在处理复杂多模型拟合问题，尤其是含噪声和异常值的实际场景中具有潜力。

Abstract: Multi-model fitting (MMF) presents a significant challenge in Computer
Vision, particularly due to its combinatorial nature. While recent advancements
in quantum computing offer promise for addressing NP-hard problems, existing
quantum-based approaches for model fitting are either limited to a single model
or consider multi-model scenarios within outlier-free datasets. This paper
introduces a novel approach, the robust quantum multi-model fitting (R-QuMF)
algorithm, designed to handle outliers effectively. Our method leverages the
intrinsic capabilities of quantum hardware to tackle combinatorial challenges
inherent in MMF tasks, and it does not require prior knowledge of the exact
number of models, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. By formulating
the problem as a maximum set coverage task for adiabatic quantum computers
(AQC), R-QuMF outperforms existing quantum techniques, demonstrating superior
performance across various synthetic and real-world 3D datasets. Our findings
underscore the potential of quantum computing in addressing the complexities of
MMF, especially in real-world scenarios with noisy and outlier-prone data.

Motivation: 提升海上船只的自动目标识别（ATR）能力，需要更先进的ISAR处理器，不仅能提供聚焦图像，还能确定船只的姿态（如垂直或水平视图）。

Method: 结合聚焦算法和船只姿态建模方法，引入两个角度（水平旋转的角度和有效掠射角的变化）来描述船只的旋转。

Conclusion: 本文扩展了前人工作，通过多角度建模显著提升了船只姿态估计的准确性，为ATR识别提供了更可靠的支持。

Abstract: To improve ATR identification of ships at sea requires an advanced ISAR
processor - one that not only provides focused images but can also determine
the pose of the ship. This tells us whether the image shows a profile (vertical
plane) view, a plan (horizontal plane) view or some view in between. If the
processor can provide this information, then the ATR processor can try to match
the images with known vertical or horizontal features of ships and, in
conjunction with estimated ship length, narrow the set of possible
identifications. This paper extends the work of Melendez and Bennett [M-B, Ref.
1] by combining a focus algorithm with a method that models the angles of the
ship relative to the radar. In M-B the algorithm was limited to a single angle
and the plane of rotation was not determined. This assumption may be fine for a
short time image where there is limited data available to determine the pose.
However, the present paper models the ship rotation with two angles - aspect
angle, representing rotation in the horizontal plane, and tilt angle,
representing variations in the effective grazing angle to the ship.

various proposed methods, reducing memorization of large datasets without
noticeable degradation in model utility remains challenging. In this paper, we
investigate the mean teacher algorithm (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017), a simple
proximal optimization method from continual learning literature that gradually
modifies the teacher model. We show that the mean teacher can approximate a
trajectory of a slow natural gradient descent (NGD), which inherently seeks
low-curvature updates that are less likely to degrade the model utility. While
slow NGD can suffer from vanishing gradients, we introduce a new unlearning
loss called "negative log-unlikelihood" (NLUL) that avoids this problem. We
show that the combination of mean teacher and NLUL improves some metrics on the
MUSE benchmarks (Shi et al., 2024).

*Saksham Rastogi,Pratyush Maini,Danish Pruthi*

TLDR: STAMP是一个用于检测数据集成员资格的框架，通过生成带有水印的改写内容，比较模型对公开和私有版本的概率，以证明数据集是否被用于LLM的预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据创作者和基准测试管理者担心其专有数据未经许可或署名被用于LLM训练，STAMP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 生成多个带有唯一密钥水印的改写版本，公开一个版本，保留其他版本，通过统计测试比较模型对公开和私有版本的概率。

Result: STAMP成功检测到训练数据中仅出现一次且占比极低的四个基准测试数据集，优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: STAMP能有效检测数据集成员资格，同时保留原始数据的语义和实用性，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Given how large parts of publicly available text are crawled to pretrain
large language models (LLMs), data creators increasingly worry about the
inclusion of their proprietary data for model training without attribution or
licensing. Their concerns are also shared by benchmark curators whose test-sets
might be compromised. In this paper, we present STAMP, a framework for
detecting dataset membership-i.e., determining the inclusion of a dataset in
the pretraining corpora of LLMs. Given an original piece of content, our
proposal involves first generating multiple rephrases, each embedding a
watermark with a unique secret key. One version is to be released publicly,
while others are to be kept private. Subsequently, creators can compare model
likelihoods between public and private versions using paired statistical tests
to prove membership. We show that our framework can successfully detect
contamination across four benchmarks which appear only once in the training
data and constitute less than 0.001% of the total tokens, outperforming several
contamination detection and dataset inference baselines. We verify that STAMP
preserves both the semantic meaning and the utility of the original data in
comparing different models. We apply STAMP to two real-world scenarios to
confirm the inclusion of paper abstracts and blog articles in the pretraining
corpora.

*Minsu Koh,Beom-Chul Park,Heejo Kong,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为LA2Former的局部感知注意力Transformer，用于改进基于Transformer的神经算子，以解决PDE在复杂和不规则域上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Fourier神经算子依赖均匀网格，限制了其在复杂几何和不规则网格上的应用。现有Transformer方法虽能克服部分限制，但忽略了局部动态行为。

Method: LA2Former结合K近邻动态分块和全局-局部注意力机制，利用线性注意力编码全局上下文，同时通过成对注意力捕捉局部交互。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，LA2Former比现有线性注意力方法预测精度提高50%以上，并在最优条件下优于全成对注意力方法。

Conclusion: 局部特征学习对提升基于Transformer的神经算子在复杂域上的PDE求解至关重要。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as promising frameworks for learning mappings
governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), serving as data-driven
alternatives to traditional numerical methods. While methods such as the
Fourier neural operator (FNO) have demonstrated notable performance, their
reliance on uniform grids restricts their applicability to complex geometries
and irregular meshes. Recently, Transformer-based neural operators with linear
attention mechanisms have shown potential in overcoming these limitations for
large-scale PDE simulations. However, these approaches predominantly emphasize
global feature aggregation, often overlooking fine-scale dynamics and localized
PDE behaviors essential for accurate solutions. To address these challenges, we
propose the Locality-Aware Attention Transformer (LA2Former), which leverages
K-nearest neighbors for dynamic patchifying and integrates global-local
attention for enhanced PDE modeling. By combining linear attention for
efficient global context encoding with pairwise attention for capturing
intricate local interactions, LA2Former achieves an optimal balance between
computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. Extensive evaluations across
six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LA2Former improves predictive accuracy
by over 50% relative to existing linear attention methods, while also
outperforming full pairwise attention under optimal conditions. This work
underscores the critical importance of localized feature learning in advancing
Transformer-based neural operators for solving PDEs on complex and irregular
domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型生成序列时，标记归因成本高，传统消融方法效率低，注意力权重虽常用但不可靠。

Method: 将不同注意力头的权重作为特征，通过学习利用这些权重进行归因，提出AT2方法。

Result: AT2在性能上与消融方法相当，但效率显著更高，并能用于上下文修剪提升问答质量。

Conclusion: AT2是一种高效可靠的标记归因方法，适用于实际应用如问答优化。

Abstract: Given a sequence of tokens generated by a language model, we may want to
identify the preceding tokens that influence the model to generate this
sequence. Performing such token attribution is expensive; a common approach is
to ablate preceding tokens and directly measure their effects. To reduce the
cost of token attribution, we revisit attention weights as a heuristic for how
a language model uses previous tokens. Naive approaches to attribute model
behavior with attention (e.g., averaging attention weights across attention
heads to estimate a token's influence) have been found to be unreliable. To
attain faithful attributions, we propose treating the attention weights of
different attention heads as features. This way, we can learn how to
effectively leverage attention weights for attribution (using signal from
ablations). Our resulting method, Attribution with Attention (AT2), reliably
performs on par with approaches that involve many ablations, while being
significantly more efficient. To showcase the utility of AT2, we use it to
prune less important parts of a provided context in a question answering
setting, improving answer quality. We provide code for AT2 at
https://github.com/MadryLab/AT2 .

Result: 发现SAE特征能编码任务信息并诱导任务执行，任务向量可由稀疏SAE潜在变量近似，揭示了任务检测特征与执行特征通过注意力机制和MLP子层的因果联系。

Conclusion: 稀疏自编码器在解释上下文学习机制方面具有潜力，任务向量可通过稀疏SAE特征近似，为理解大语言模型的行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular tool for interpreting large language
model activations, but their utility in addressing open questions in
interpretability remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate their
effectiveness by using SAEs to deepen our understanding of the mechanism behind
in-context learning (ICL). We identify abstract SAE features that (i) encode
the model's knowledge of which task to execute and (ii) whose latent vectors
causally induce the task zero-shot. This aligns with prior work showing that
ICL is mediated by task vectors. We further demonstrate that these task vectors
are well approximated by a sparse sum of SAE latents, including these
task-execution features. To explore the ICL mechanism, we adapt the sparse
feature circuits methodology of Marks et al. (2024) to work for the much larger
Gemma-1 2B model, with 30 times as many parameters, and to the more complex
task of ICL. Through circuit finding, we discover task-detecting features with
corresponding SAE latents that activate earlier in the prompt, that detect when
tasks have been performed. They are causally linked with task-execution
features through the attention and MLP sublayers.

Motivation: 强化学习在大型语言模型中提升推理能力时，面临计算与内存需求不对称的问题，推理阶段可并行且内存占用低，而策略更新需同步且内存密集。

Method: 提出PODS框架，通过max-variance down-sampling方法选择具有最大多样性奖励信号的rollout子集进行策略更新。

Result: PODS框架在GSM8K基准测试中表现优于标准GRPO。

Conclusion: PODS通过解耦推理与策略更新阶段，有效解决了RL中的不对称问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing
reasoning capabilities in large language models, but faces a fundamental
asymmetry in computation and memory requirements: inference is embarrassingly
parallel with a minimal memory footprint, while policy updates require
extensive synchronization and are memory-intensive. To address this asymmetry,
we introduce PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling), a framework that
strategically decouples these phases by generating numerous rollouts in
parallel but updating only on an informative subset. Within this framework, we
develop max-variance down-sampling, a theoretically motivated method that
selects rollouts with maximally diverse reward signals. We prove that this
approach has an efficient algorithmic solution, and empirically demonstrate
that GRPO with PODS using max-variance down-sampling achieves superior
performance over standard GRPO on the GSM8K benchmark.

Motivation: 现有研究多采用二元分类（健康vs抑郁），无法捕捉抑郁症的异质性。本研究旨在通过可穿戴设备区分抑郁症亚型，以支持更精准的诊断和治疗。

Method: 使用CALYPSO数据集，通过生理和行为信号（如血容量脉冲、皮肤电活动、体温和加速度）进行非侵入性检测，并采用标准机器学习方法建立基准。

Result: 加速度数据提取的体力活动特征对区分单相和双相抑郁最有效（准确率96.77%），体温特征也表现优异（准确率93.55%）。

Conclusion: 生理和行为监测在抑郁症亚型分类中具有潜力，可为临床干预提供更个性化的支持。

Abstract: Depression is a complex mental disorder characterized by a diverse range of
observable and measurable indicators that go beyond traditional subjective
assessments. Recent research has increasingly focused on objective, passive,
and continuous monitoring using wearable devices to gain more precise insights
into the physiological and behavioral aspects of depression. However, most
existing studies primarily distinguish between healthy and depressed
individuals, adopting a binary classification that fails to capture the
heterogeneity of depressive disorders. In this study, we leverage wearable
devices to predict depression subtypes-specifically unipolar and bipolar
depression-aiming to identify distinctive biomarkers that could enhance
diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment strategies. To this
end, we introduce the CALYPSO dataset, designed for non-invasive detection of
depression subtypes and symptomatology through physiological and behavioral
signals, including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, body
temperature, and three-axis acceleration. Additionally, we establish a
benchmark on the dataset using well-known features and standard machine
learning methods. Preliminary results indicate that features related to
physical activity, extracted from accelerometer data, are the most effective in
distinguishing between unipolar and bipolar depression, achieving an accuracy
of $96.77\%$. Temperature-based features also showed high discriminative power,
reaching an accuracy of $93.55\%$. These findings highlight the potential of
physiological and behavioral monitoring for improving the classification of
depressive subtypes, paving the way for more tailored clinical interventions.

Conclusion: 结合AI技术，高光谱数据将为浮游植物群落动态研究开辟新途径。

Abstract: Phytoplankton absorb and scatter light in unique ways, subtly altering the
color of water, changes that are often minor for human eyes to detect but can
be captured by sensitive ocean color instruments onboard satellites from space.
Hyperspectral sensors, paired with advanced algorithms, are expected to
significantly enhance the characterization of phytoplankton community
composition, especially in coastal waters where ocean color remote sensing
applications have historically encountered significant challenges. This study
presents novel machine learning-based solutions for NASA's hyperspectral
missions, including EMIT and PACE, tackling high-fidelity retrievals of
phytoplankton absorption coefficient and chlorophyll a from their hyperspectral
remote sensing reflectance. Given that a single Rrs spectrum may correspond to
varied combinations of inherent optical properties and associated
concentrations, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is used as a backbone in this
study to handle such multi-distribution prediction problems. We first time
tailor the VAE model with innovative designs to achieve hyperspectral
retrievals of aphy and of Chl-a from hyperspectral Rrs in optically complex
estuarine-coastal waters. Validation with extensive experimental observation
demonstrates superior performance of the VAE models with high precision and low
bias. The in-depth analysis of VAE's advanced model structures and learning
designs highlights the improvement and advantages of VAE-based solutions over
the mixture density network (MDN) approach, particularly on high-dimensional
data, such as PACE. Our study provides strong evidence that current EMIT and
PACE hyperspectral data as well as the upcoming Surface Biology Geology mission
will open new pathways toward a better understanding of phytoplankton community
dynamics in aquatic ecosystems when integrated with AI technologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力机制计算复杂度高且结构僵化，难以适用于资源受限场景（如边缘设备或实时系统）。

Conclusion: MAAM通过硬件加速和低内存占用，为资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案，且不牺牲准确性。

Abstract: The demand for lightweight models in image classification tasks under
resource-constrained environments necessitates a balance between computational
efficiency and robust feature representation. Traditional attention mechanisms,
despite their strong feature modeling capability, often struggle with high
computational complexity and structural rigidity, limiting their applicability
in scenarios with limited computational resources (e.g., edge devices or
real-time systems). To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Aggregation
Module (MAAM), a lightweight attention architecture integrated with the
MindSpore framework. MAAM employs three parallel agent branches with
independently parameterized operations to extract heterogeneous features,
adaptively fused via learnable scalar weights, and refined through a
convolutional compression layer. Leveraging MindSpore's dynamic computational
graph and operator fusion, MAAM achieves 87.0% accuracy on the CIFAR-10
dataset, significantly outperforming conventional CNN (58.3%) and MLP (49.6%)
models, while improving training efficiency by 30%. Ablation studies confirm
the critical role of agent attention (accuracy drops to 32.0% if removed) and
compression modules (25.5% if omitted), validating their necessity for
maintaining discriminative feature learning. The framework's hardware
acceleration capabilities and minimal memory footprint further demonstrate its
practicality, offering a deployable solution for image classification in
resource-constrained scenarios without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning (DL) has transformed healthcare,
particularly in cancer detection and diagnosis. DL surpasses traditional
machine learning and human accuracy, making it a critical tool for identifying
diseases. Despite numerous reviews on DL in healthcare, a comprehensive
analysis of its role in cancer detection remains limited. Existing studies
focus on specific aspects, leaving gaps in understanding its broader impact.
This paper addresses these gaps by reviewing advanced DL techniques, including
transfer learning (TL), reinforcement learning (RL), federated learning (FL),
Transformers, and large language models (LLMs). These approaches enhance
accuracy, tackle data scarcity, and enable decentralized learning while
maintaining data privacy. TL adapts pre-trained models to new datasets,
improving performance with limited labeled data. RL optimizes diagnostic
pathways and treatment strategies, while FL fosters collaborative model
development without sharing sensitive data. Transformers and LLMs,
traditionally used in natural language processing, are now applied to medical
data for improved interpretability. Additionally, this review examines these
techniques' efficiency in cancer diagnosis, addresses challenges like data
imbalance, and proposes solutions. It serves as a resource for researchers and
practitioners, providing insights into current trends and guiding future
research in advanced DL for cancer detection.

Abstract: Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and among
its many forms, brain tumors are particularly notorious due to their aggressive
nature and the critical challenges involved in early diagnosis. Recent advances
in artificial intelligence have shown great promise in assisting medical
professionals with precise tumor segmentation, a key step in timely diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, many state-of-the-art segmentation methods
require extensive computational resources and prolonged training times,
limiting their practical application in resource-constrained settings. In this
work, we present a novel dual-decoder U-Net architecture enhanced with
attention-gated skip connections, designed specifically for brain tumor
segmentation from MRI scans. Our approach balances efficiency and accuracy by
achieving competitive segmentation performance while significantly reducing
training demands. Evaluated on the BraTS 2020 dataset, the proposed model
achieved Dice scores of 85.06% for Whole Tumor (WT), 80.61% for Tumor Core

commonly used U-Net variants. Our model demonstrates that high-quality brain
tumor segmentation is attainable even under limited computational resources,
thereby offering a viable solution for researchers and clinicians operating
with modest hardware. This resource-efficient model has the potential to
improve early detection and diagnosis of brain tumors, ultimately contributing
to better patient outcomes

Conclusion: 尽管SAM具有通用性，但在3D医学图像分割任务中可能不如专用模型（如3D U-Net）适用于精细结构。

Abstract: Menisci are cartilaginous tissue found within the knee that contribute to
joint lubrication and weight dispersal. Damage to menisci can lead to onset and
progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA), a condition that is a leading cause of
disability, and for which there are few effective therapies. Accurate automated
segmentation of menisci would allow for earlier detection and treatment of
meniscal abnormalities, as well as shedding more light on the role the menisci
play in OA pathogenesis. Focus in this area has mainly used variants of
convolutional networks, but there has been no attempt to utilise recent large
vision transformer segmentation models. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a
so-called foundation segmentation model, which has been found useful across a
range of different tasks due to the large volume of data used for training the
model. In this study, SAM was adapted to perform fully-automated segmentation
of menisci from 3D knee magnetic resonance images. A 3D U-Net was also trained
as a baseline. It was found that, when fine-tuning only the decoder, SAM was
unable to compete with 3D U-Net, achieving a Dice score of $0.81\pm0.03$,
compared to $0.87\pm0.03$, on a held-out test set. When fine-tuning SAM
end-to-end, a Dice score of $0.87\pm0.03$ was achieved. The performance of both
the end-to-end trained SAM configuration and the 3D U-Net were comparable to
the winning Dice score ($0.88\pm0.03$) in the IWOAI Knee MRI Segmentation
Challenge 2019. Performance in terms of the Hausdorff Distance showed that both
configurations of SAM were inferior to 3D U-Net in matching the meniscus
morphology. Results demonstrated that, despite its generalisability, SAM was
unable to outperform a basic 3D U-Net in meniscus segmentation, and may not be
suitable for similar 3D medical image segmentation tasks also involving fine
anatomical structures with low contrast and poorly-defined boundaries.

Conclusion: 本文提出的策略有效解决了INR训练速度慢的问题，为CT重建提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Inspired by their success in solving challenging inverse problems in computer
vision, implicit neural representations (INRs) have been recently proposed for
reconstruction in low-dose/sparse-view X-ray computed tomography (CT). An INR
represents a CT image as a small-scale neural network that takes spatial
coordinates as inputs and outputs attenuation values. Fitting an INR to
sinogram data is similar to classical model-based iterative reconstruction
methods. However, training INRs with losses and gradient-based algorithms can
be prohibitively slow, taking many thousands of iterations to converge. This
paper investigates strategies to accelerate the optimization of INRs for CT
reconstruction. In particular, we propose two approaches: (1) using a modified
loss function with improved conditioning, and (2) an algorithm based on the
alternating direction method of multipliers. We illustrate that both of these
approaches significantly accelerate INR-based reconstruction of a synthetic
breast CT phantom in a sparse-view setting.

Abstract: Automated noninvasive cardiac diagnosis plays a critical role in the early
detection of cardiac disorders and cost-effective clinical management.
Automated diagnosis involves the automated segmentation and analysis of cardiac
images. Precise delineation of cardiac substructures and extraction of their
morphological attributes are essential for evaluating the cardiac function, and
diagnosing cardiovascular disease such as cardiomyopathy, valvular diseases,
abnormalities related to septum perforations, and blood-flow rate. Semantic
segmentation labels the CMR image at the pixel level, and localizes its
subcomponents to facilitate the detection of abnormalities, including
abnormalities in cardiac wall motion in an aging heart with muscle
abnormalities, vascular abnormalities, and valvular abnormalities. In this
paper, we describe a model to improve semantic segmentation of CMR images. The
model extracts edge-attributes and context information during down-sampling of
the U-Net and infuses this information during up-sampling to localize three
major cardiac structures: left ventricle cavity (LV); right ventricle cavity
(RV); and LV myocardium (LMyo). We present an algorithm and performance
results. A comparison of our model with previous leading models, using
similarity metrics between actual image and segmented image, shows that our
approach improves Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) by 2%-11% and lowers
Hausdorff distance (HD) by 1.6 to 5.7 mm.

Abstract: We propose an enhanced deep learning-based model for image segmentation of
the left and right ventricles and myocardium scar tissue from cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR) images. The proposed technique integrates UNet, channel and
spatial attention, edge-detection based skip-connection and deep supervised
learning to improve the accuracy of the CMR image-segmentation. Images are
processed using multiple channels to generate multiple feature-maps. We built a
dual attention-based model to integrate channel and spatial attention. The use
of extracted edges in skip connection improves the reconstructed images from
feature-maps. The use of deep supervision reduces vanishing gradient problems
inherent in classification based on deep neural networks. The algorithms for
dual attention-based model, corresponding implementation and performance
results are described. The performance results show that this approach has
attained high accuracy: 98% Dice Similarity Score (DSC) and significantly lower
Hausdorff Distance (HD). The performance results outperform other leading
techniques both in DSC and HD.

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: 提出了一种名为Filter2Noise（F2N）的可解释自监督单图像去噪框架，通过注意力引导的双边滤波器和轻量级模块实现用户可控的去噪，并在低剂量CT数据上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低剂量CT去噪中监督方法依赖配对数据、自监督方法依赖多噪声图像且缺乏机制解释的问题。

Method: 使用注意力引导的双边滤波器，通过轻量级模块预测空间变化的滤波器参数，并引入新的下采样打乱策略和自监督损失函数。

Result: 在Mayo Clinic 2016数据集上，F2N比领先的自监督单图像方法（ZS-N2N）PSNR提高了4.59 dB，同时提升了透明度和用户控制。

Conclusion: F2N为需要精确且可解释去噪的医疗应用提供了关键优势。

Abstract: Effective denoising is crucial in low-dose CT to enhance subtle structures
and low-contrast lesions while preventing diagnostic errors. Supervised methods
struggle with limited paired datasets, and self-supervised approaches often
require multiple noisy images and rely on deep networks like U-Net, offering
little insight into the denoising mechanism. To address these challenges, we
propose an interpretable self-supervised single-image denoising framework --
Filter2Noise (F2N). Our approach introduces an Attention-Guided Bilateral
Filter that adapted to each noisy input through a lightweight module that
predicts spatially varying filter parameters, which can be visualized and
adjusted post-training for user-controlled denoising in specific regions of
interest. To enable single-image training, we introduce a novel downsampling
shuffle strategy with a new self-supervised loss function that extends the
concept of Noise2Noise to a single image and addresses spatially correlated
noise. On the Mayo Clinic 2016 low-dose CT dataset, F2N outperforms the leading
self-supervised single-image method (ZS-N2N) by 4.59 dB PSNR while improving
transparency, user control, and parametric efficiency. These features provide
key advantages for medical applications that require precise and interpretable
noise reduction. Our code is demonstrated at

Abstract: Accurate retinal vessel segmentation provides essential structural
information for ophthalmic image analysis. However, existing methods struggle
with challenges such as multi-scale vessel variability, complex curvatures, and
ambiguous boundaries. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
Transformer-based models and Mamba-based architectures have advanced the field,
they often suffer from vascular discontinuities or edge feature ambiguity. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid framework that
synergistically integrates CNNs and Mamba for high-precision retinal vessel
segmentation. Our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) The proposed
High-Resolution Edge Fuse Network is a high-resolution preserving hybrid
segmentation framework that combines a multi-scale backbone with the
Multi-scale Retina Edge Fusion (MREF) module to enhance edge features, ensuring
accurate and robust vessel segmentation. 2) The Dynamic Snake Visual State
Space block combines Dynamic Snake Convolution with Mamba to adaptively capture
vessel curvature details and long-range dependencies. An improved
eight-directional 2D Snake-Selective Scan mechanism and a dynamic weighting
strategy enhance the perception of complex vascular topologies. 3) The MREF
module enhances boundary precision through multi-scale edge feature
aggregation, suppressing noise while emphasizing critical vessel structures
across scales. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in maintaining vascular
continuity and effectively segmenting vessels in low-contrast regions. This
work provides a robust method for clinical applications requiring accurate
retinal vessel analysis. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型多基于单模态和单中心数据，难以适应真实临床环境，因此需要更可靠的息肉分割方法。

Method: FocusNet包含三个模块：CIDM生成粗分割图，DEM优化浅层特征，FAM通过局部和池化注意力机制平衡细节与全局上下文。

Result: 在PolypDB数据集上，FocusNet在五种模态下的Dice系数显著优于现有方法，最高达93.42%。

Conclusion: FocusNet在多模态和多中心数据中表现出色，为临床息肉分割提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Colonoscopy is vital in the early diagnosis of colorectal polyps. Regular
screenings can effectively prevent benign polyps from progressing to CRC. While
deep learning has made impressive strides in polyp segmentation, most existing
models are trained on single-modality and single-center data, making them less
effective in real-world clinical environments. To overcome these limitations,
we propose FocusNet, a Transformer-enhanced focus attention network designed to
improve polyp segmentation. FocusNet incorporates three essential modules: the
Cross-semantic Interaction Decoder Module (CIDM) for generating coarse
segmentation maps, the Detail Enhancement Module (DEM) for refining shallow
features, and the Focus Attention Module (FAM), to balance local detail and
global context through local and pooling attention mechanisms. We evaluate our
model on PolypDB, a newly introduced dataset with multi-modality and
multi-center data for building more reliable segmentation methods. Extensive
experiments showed that FocusNet consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches with a high dice coefficients of 82.47% on the BLI
modality, 88.46% on FICE, 92.04% on LCI, 82.09% on the NBI and 93.42% on WLI
modality, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness across five different
modalities. The source code for FocusNet is available at

Conclusion: ViG3D-UNet有效解决了血管分割的连续性问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate vascular segmentation is essential for coronary visualization and
the diagnosis of coronary heart disease. This task involves the extraction of
sparse tree-like vascular branches from the volumetric space. However, existing
methods have faced significant challenges due to discontinuous vascular
segmentation and missing endpoints. To address this issue, a 3D vision graph
neural network framework, named ViG3D-UNet, was introduced. This method
integrates 3D graph representation and aggregation within a U-shaped
architecture to facilitate continuous vascular segmentation. The ViG3D module
captures volumetric vascular connectivity and topology, while the convolutional
module extracts fine vascular details. These two branches are combined through
channel attention to form the encoder feature. Subsequently, a paperclip-shaped
offset decoder minimizes redundant computations in the sparse feature space and
restores the feature map size to match the original input dimensions. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for continuous vascular
segmentation, evaluations were performed on two public datasets, ASOCA and
ImageCAS. The segmentation results show that the ViG3D-UNet surpassed competing
methods in maintaining vascular segmentation connectivity while achieving high
segmentation accuracy. Our code will be available soon.

Abstract: In this work, we present SupResDiffGAN, a novel hybrid architecture that
combines the strengths of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion
models for super-resolution tasks. By leveraging latent space representations
and reducing the number of diffusion steps, SupResDiffGAN achieves
significantly faster inference times than other diffusion-based
super-resolution models while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. To
prevent discriminator overfitting, we propose adaptive noise corruption,
ensuring a stable balance between the generator and the discriminator during
training. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach
outperforms traditional diffusion models such as SR3 and I$^2$SB in efficiency
and image quality. This work bridges the performance gap between diffusion- and
GAN-based methods, laying the foundation for real-time applications of
diffusion models in high-resolution image generation.

Motivation: 填补缺乏理论框架理解高风险自杀意图的空白，探索AI在心理健康支持中的潜力。

Method: 采用IPTS理论分析59,607篇Reddit帖子，分类为自杀意念维度和风险因素，并进行语言和内容分析。

Result: 高风险帖子表达计划、工具和痛苦；AI回应虽结构连贯，但缺乏动态和个性化支持。

Conclusion: 需更深入理解和谨慎开发AI驱动的心理健康干预措施。

Abstract: Suicide is a critical global public health issue, with millions experiencing
suicidal ideation (SI) each year. Online spaces enable individuals to express
SI and seek peer support. While prior research has revealed the potential of
detecting SI using machine learning and natural language analysis, a key
limitation is the lack of a theoretical framework to understand the underlying
factors affecting high-risk suicidal intent. To bridge this gap, we adopted the
Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS) as an analytic lens to analyze 59,607
posts from Reddit's r/SuicideWatch, categorizing them into SI dimensions
(Loneliness, Lack of Reciprocal Love, Self Hate, and Liability) and risk
factors (Thwarted Belongingness, Perceived Burdensomeness, and Acquired
Capability of Suicide). We found that high-risk SI posts express planning and
attempts, methods and tools, and weaknesses and pain. In addition, we also
examined the language of supportive responses through psycholinguistic and
content analyses to find that individuals respond differently to different
stages of Suicidal Ideation (SI) posts. Finally, we explored the role of AI
chatbots in providing effective supportive responses to suicidal ideation
posts. We found that although AI improved structural coherence, expert
evaluations highlight persistent shortcomings in providing dynamic,
personalized, and deeply empathetic support. These findings underscore the need
for careful reflection and deeper understanding in both the development and
consideration of AI-driven interventions for effective mental health support.

Abstract: Generating high-quality, photorealistic textures for 3D human avatars remains
a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision and multimedia field.
However, real paired front and back images of human subjects are rarely
available with privacy, ethical and cost of acquisition, which restricts
scalability of the data. Additionally, learning priors from image inputs using
deep generative models, such as GANs or diffusion models, to infer unseen
regions such as the human back often leads to artifacts, structural
inconsistencies, or loss of fine-grained detail. To address these issues, we
present SMPL-GPTexture (skinned multi-person linear model - general purpose
Texture), a novel pipeline that takes natural language prompts as input and
leverages a state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model to produce paired
high-resolution front and back images of a human subject as the starting point
for texture estimation. Using the generated paired dual-view images, we first
employ a human mesh recovery model to obtain a robust 2D-to-3D SMPL alignment
between image pixels and the 3D model's UV coordinates for each views. Second,
we use an inverted rasterization technique that explicitly projects the
observed colour from the input images into the UV space, thereby producing
accurate, complete texture maps. Finally, we apply a diffusion-based inpainting
module to fill in the missing regions, and the fusion mechanism then combines
these results into a unified full texture map. Extensive experiments shows that
our SMPL-GPTexture can generate high resolution texture aligned with user's
prompts.

Result: 实验表明，THUNDER显著提高了唇同步质量，同时保持了表情的多样性和高质量。

Conclusion: THUNDER通过可微分语音生成监督，成功实现了高质量唇同步和丰富表情的平衡。

Abstract: In order to be widely applicable, speech-driven 3D head avatars must
articulate their lips in accordance with speech, while also conveying the
appropriate emotions with dynamically changing facial expressions. The key
problem is that deterministic models produce high-quality lip-sync but without
rich expressions, whereas stochastic models generate diverse expressions but
with lower lip-sync quality. To get the best of both, we seek a stochastic
model with accurate lip-sync. To that end, we develop a new approach based on
the following observation: if a method generates realistic 3D lip motions, it
should be possible to infer the spoken audio from the lip motion. The inferred
speech should match the original input audio, and erroneous predictions create
a novel supervision signal for training 3D talking head avatars with accurate
lip-sync. To demonstrate this effect, we propose THUNDER (Talking Heads Under
Neural Differentiable Elocution Reconstruction), a 3D talking head avatar
framework that introduces a novel supervision mechanism via differentiable
sound production. First, we train a novel mesh-to-speech model that regresses
audio from facial animation. Then, we incorporate this model into a
diffusion-based talking avatar framework. During training, the mesh-to-speech
model takes the generated animation and produces a sound that is compared to
the input speech, creating a differentiable analysis-by-audio-synthesis
supervision loop. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that THUNDER significantly improves the quality of the lip-sync of
talking head avatars while still allowing for generation of diverse,
high-quality, expressive facial animations.

Conclusion: X-Teaming为缓解复杂对话攻击提供了关键工具和见解，推动了多轮对话安全的发展。

Abstract: Multi-turn interactions with language models (LMs) pose critical safety
risks, as harmful intent can be strategically spread across exchanges. Yet, the
vast majority of prior work has focused on single-turn safety, while
adaptability and diversity remain among the key challenges of multi-turn
red-teaming. To address these challenges, we present X-Teaming, a scalable
framework that systematically explores how seemingly harmless interactions
escalate into harmful outcomes and generates corresponding attack scenarios.
X-Teaming employs collaborative agents for planning, attack optimization, and
verification, achieving state-of-the-art multi-turn jailbreak effectiveness and
diversity with success rates up to 98.1% across representative leading
open-weight and closed-source models. In particular, X-Teaming achieves a 96.2%
attack success rate against the latest Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which has been
considered nearly immune to single-turn attacks. Building on X-Teaming, we
introduce XGuard-Train, an open-source multi-turn safety training dataset that
is 20x larger than the previous best resource, comprising 30K interactive
jailbreaks, designed to enable robust multi-turn safety alignment for LMs. Our
work offers essential tools and insights for mitigating sophisticated
conversational attacks, advancing the multi-turn safety of LMs.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法需要大量查询和目标模型信息，不适用于目标模型完全封闭的真实场景。

Method: 使用替代模型生成对抗句子，结合受控生成技术，实现目标无关的攻击。

Result: 在八个数据集上验证了方法的有效性，包括高迁移性和高质量对抗样本生成。

Conclusion: Q-faker在硬黑盒设置下具有实用性，且无需访问目标模型。

Abstract: Many adversarial attack approaches are proposed to verify the vulnerability
of language models. However, they require numerous queries and the information
on the target model. Even black-box attack methods also require the target
model's output information. They are not applicable in real-world scenarios, as
in hard black-box settings where the target model is closed and inaccessible.
Even the recently proposed hard black-box attacks still require many queries
and demand extremely high costs for training adversarial generators. To address
these challenges, we propose Q-faker (Query-free Hard Black-box Attacker), a
novel and efficient method that generates adversarial examples without
accessing the target model. To avoid accessing the target model, we use a
surrogate model instead. The surrogate model generates adversarial sentences
for a target-agnostic attack. During this process, we leverage controlled
generation techniques. We evaluate our proposed method on eight datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate our method's effectiveness including high
transferability and the high quality of the generated adversarial examples, and
prove its practical in hard black-box settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（人工、基于指标、基于LLM）存在效率低或依赖参考答案的问题，而基于LLM的方法因缺乏多源知识和复杂代码理解能力而受限。

Method: CodeVisionary分为两阶段：多源知识分析阶段和协商评分阶段，前者收集知识，后者通过讨论达成评分共识。

Result: CodeVisionary在Pearson、Spearman和Kendall-Tau系数上分别平均提升0.202、0.139和0.117，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CodeVisionary不仅提升了评估性能，还提供详细报告帮助开发者改进，资源已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code
generation, underscoring the critical need for rigorous and comprehensive
evaluation. Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories,
including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that
human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly
rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing
attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities and
superior efficiency. However, the performance of LLM-based approaches remains
limited due to: (1) lack of multisource domain knowledge, and (2) insufficient
comprehension of complex code.
  To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first LLM-based
agent framework for evaluating LLMs in code generation. CodeVisionary consists
of two stages: (1) Multiscore knowledge analysis stage, which aims to gather
multisource and comprehensive domain knowledge by formulating and executing a
stepwise evaluation plan. (2) Negotiation-based scoring stage, which involves
multiple judges engaging in discussions to better comprehend the complex code
and reach a consensus on the evaluation score. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CodeVisionary achieves the best performance for evaluating
LLMs in code generation, outperforming the best baseline methods with average
improvements of 0.202, 0.139, and 0.117 in Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau
coefficients, respectively. Besides, CodeVisionary provides detailed evaluation
reports, which assist developers in identifying shortcomings and making
improvements. The resources of CodeVisionary are available at

(LLMs), drawing upon mathematical tools and conceptual analogies from quantum
mechanics to offer a new perspective on these complex systems. In this paper,
we clarify the core assumptions of this model, providing a detailed exposition
of six key principles that govern semantic representation, interaction, and
dynamics within LLMs. The goal is to justify that a quantum-inspired framework
is a valid approach to studying semantic spaces. This framework offers valuable
insights into their information processing and response generation, and we
further discuss the potential of leveraging quantum computing to develop
significantly more powerful and efficient LLMs based on these principles.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于生产理论的框架，结合准确性和推理成本评估语言模型的经济价值，引入了“cost-of-pass”和“frontier cost-of-pass”指标，揭示了不同模型在不同任务中的成本效益，并分析了技术进步对成本效率的推动作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI系统在经济中的广泛应用需要权衡其性能与成本，但目前缺乏综合考量这两者的指标。

Method: 提出基于生产理论的框架，结合准确性和推理成本，定义“cost-of-pass”和“frontier cost-of-pass”，并通过分析模型在不同任务中的表现和成本效益，评估技术进步的影响。

Result: 轻量级模型在基础定量任务中最具成本效益，大型模型适用于知识密集型任务，推理模型适合复杂定量问题。技术进步显著降低了复杂任务的成本。

Conclusion: 模型级创新是成本效率的主要驱动力，提出的经济框架为衡量进展和指导部署提供了工具。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI systems in the economy hinges on their ability
to generate economic value that outweighs their inference costs. Evaluating
this tradeoff requires metrics that account for both performance and costs. We
propose a framework grounded in production theory for evaluating language
models by combining accuracy and inference cost. We introduce "cost-of-pass",
the expected monetary cost of generating a correct solution. We then define the
"frontier cost-of-pass" as the minimum cost-of-pass achievable across available
models or the "human-expert, using the approximate cost of hiring an expert.
Our analysis reveals distinct economic insights. First, lightweight models are
most cost-effective for basic quantitative tasks, large models for
knowledge-intensive ones, and reasoning models for complex quantitative
problems, despite higher per-token costs. Second, tracking this frontier
cost-of-pass over the past year reveals significant progress, particularly for
complex quantitative tasks where the cost has roughly halved every few months.
Third, to trace key innovations driving this progress, we examine
counterfactual frontiers: estimates of cost-efficiency without specific model
classes. We find that innovations in lightweight, large, and reasoning models
have been essential for pushing the frontier in basic quantitative,
knowledge-intensive, and complex quantitative tasks, respectively. Finally, we
assess the cost-reductions afforded by common inference-time techniques like
majority voting and self-refinement, finding that their marginal accuracy gains
rarely justify their costs. Our findings underscore that complementary
model-level innovations are the primary drivers of cost-efficiency, and our
economic framework provides a principled tool for measuring this progress and
guiding deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 研究发现当前大语言模型（LLMs）在概率推理方面存在不足，无法提供理性且一致的概率信念表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在概率推理中的表现，以确保其在信息检索和自动决策系统中的可信性和可解释性。

Method: 引入一个包含不确定真实性声明的新数据集，并应用多种不确定性量化技术评估LLMs的概率推理能力。

Result: 当前LLMs无法满足概率推理的基本性质。

Conclusion: LLMs在概率推理方面仍需改进，以实现更可靠的性能。

Abstract: Advances in the general capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have led
to their use for information retrieval, and as components in automated decision
systems. A faithful representation of probabilistic reasoning in these models
may be essential to ensure trustworthy, explainable and effective performance
in these tasks. Despite previous work suggesting that LLMs can perform complex
reasoning and well-calibrated uncertainty quantification, we find that current
versions of this class of model lack the ability to provide rational and
coherent representations of probabilistic beliefs. To demonstrate this, we
introduce a novel dataset of claims with indeterminate truth values and apply a
number of well-established techniques for uncertainty quantification to measure
the ability of LLM's to adhere to fundamental properties of probabilistic
reasoning.

*Yichen Wu,Xudong Pan,Geng Hong,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: OpenDeception是一个评估大型语言模型（LLM）欺骗意图和能力的框架，通过开放场景数据集和多轮对话模拟，发现主流LLM的欺骗意图比例超过80%，成功率超过50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力的提升和代理应用的普及，欺骗风险需要系统评估和有效监管。现有评估方法局限于模拟游戏或有限选择，无法全面反映真实风险。

Method: 提出OpenDeception框架，构建五种常见用例（每种包含十个现实场景），通过代理模拟多轮对话，避免伦理和高风险交互问题。

Result: 评估11种主流LLM，欺骗意图比例超80%，成功率超50%，且能力更强的LLM欺骗风险更高。

Conclusion: LLM的欺骗风险亟需关注，需加强对其欺骗行为的抑制和对齐工作。

Abstract: As the general capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve and agent
applications become more widespread, the underlying deception risks urgently
require systematic evaluation and effective oversight. Unlike existing
evaluation which uses simulated games or presents limited choices, we introduce
OpenDeception, a novel deception evaluation framework with an open-ended
scenario dataset. OpenDeception jointly evaluates both the deception intention
and capabilities of LLM-based agents by inspecting their internal reasoning
process. Specifically, we construct five types of common use cases where LLMs
intensively interact with the user, each consisting of ten diverse, concrete
scenarios from the real world. To avoid ethical concerns and costs of high-risk
deceptive interactions with human testers, we propose to simulate the
multi-turn dialogue via agent simulation. Extensive evaluation of eleven
mainstream LLMs on OpenDeception highlights the urgent need to address
deception risks and security concerns in LLM-based agents: the deception
intention ratio across the models exceeds 80%, while the deception success rate
surpasses 50%. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs with stronger capabilities do
exhibit a higher risk of deception, which calls for more alignment efforts on
inhibiting deceptive behaviors.

*Yang Yue,Zhiqi Chen,Rui Lu,Andrew Zhao,Zhaokai Wang,Yang Yue,Shiji Song,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 研究表明，强化学习（RLVR）并未为LLMs带来全新的推理能力，而是通过优化输出分布提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估RLVR是否能为LLMs带来超越基础模型的全新推理能力。

Method: 通过测量大k值下的pass@k指标，对比RL训练模型与基础模型在不同任务中的表现。

Result: RL训练模型在小k值表现更好，但大k值下基础模型表现相当或更优；RL仅优化输出分布，未扩展推理边界。

Conclusion: RLVR在提升LLM推理能力上存在局限性，需探索新范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently
demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs,
particularly in mathematics and programming tasks. It is widely believed that
RLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning
abilities that exceed corresponding base models' capacity. In this study,
however, we critically re-examines this assumption by measuring the
pass@\textit{k} metric with large values of \textit{k} to explore the reasoning
capability boundary of the models across a wide range of model families and
benchmarks. Surprisingly, the RL does \emph{not}, in fact, elicit fundamentally
new reasoning patterns. While RL-trained models outperform their base models at
smaller values of $k$ (\eg, $k$=1), base models can achieve a comparable or
even higher pass@$k$ score compared to their RL counterparts at large $k$
values. The reasoning paths generated by RL-trained models are already included
in the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that most reasoning
abilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models.
Further analysis shows that RL training boosts the performance by biasing the
model's output distribution toward paths that are more likely to yield rewards,
therefore sampling correct responses more efficiently. But this also results in
a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. Similar
results are observed in visual reasoning tasks trained with RLVR. Moreover, we
find that distillation can genuinely introduce new knowledge into the model,
different from RLVR. These findings underscore a critical limitation of RLVR in
advancing LLM reasoning abilities which requires us to fundamentally rethink
the impact of RL training in reasoning LLMs and the need of a better paradigm.

Abstract: We present a novel Adaptive Distribution Generator that leverages a quantum
walks-based approach to generate high precision and efficiency of target
probability distributions. Our method integrates variational quantum circuits
with discrete-time quantum walks, specifically, split-step quantum walks and
their entangled extensions, to dynamically tune coin parameters and drive the
evolution of quantum states towards desired distributions. This enables
accurate one-dimensional probability modeling for applications such as
financial simulation and structured two-dimensional pattern generation
exemplified by digit representations(0~9). Implemented within the CUDA-Q
framework, our approach exploits GPU acceleration to significantly reduce
computational overhead and improve scalability relative to conventional
methods. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that our Quantum Walks-Based Adaptive
Distribution Generator achieves high simulation fidelity and bridges the gap
between theoretical quantum algorithms and practical high-performance
computation.

Abstract: In this study, we address the challenges associated with accurately
determining gaze location on a screen, which is often compromised by noise from
factors such as eye tracker limitations, calibration drift, ambient lighting
changes, and eye blinks. We propose the use of an extended Kalman filter (EKF)
to smooth the gaze data collected during eye-tracking experiments, and
systematically explore the interaction of different system parameters. Our
results demonstrate that the EKF significantly reduces noise, leading to a
marked improvement in tracking accuracy. Furthermore, we show that our proposed
stochastic nonlinear dynamical model aligns well with real experimental data
and holds promise for applications in related fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多智能体通信方法的高带宽需求、智能体异构性和信息丢失等问题。

Method: 提出LangCoop框架，包括M$^3$CoT（结构化零样本视觉语言推理）和LangPack（高效信息打包为自然语言消息）。

Result: 在CARLA仿真中，LangCoop将通信带宽降低96%（每条消息<2KB），同时保持驾驶性能。

Conclusion: LangCoop为多智能体协作提供了一种高效且表达力强的通信解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration holds great promise for enhancing the safety,
reliability, and mobility of autonomous driving systems by enabling information
sharing among multiple connected agents. However, existing multi-agent
communication approaches are hindered by limitations of existing communication
media, including high bandwidth demands, agent heterogeneity, and information
loss. To address these challenges, we introduce LangCoop, a new paradigm for
collaborative autonomous driving that leverages natural language as a compact
yet expressive medium for inter-agent communication. LangCoop features two key
innovations: Mixture Model Modular Chain-of-thought (M$^3$CoT) for structured
zero-shot vision-language reasoning and Natural Language Information Packaging
(LangPack) for efficiently packaging information into concise, language-based
messages. Through extensive experiments conducted in the CARLA simulations, we
demonstrate that LangCoop achieves a remarkable 96\% reduction in communication
bandwidth (< 2KB per message) compared to image-based communication, while
maintaining competitive driving performance in the closed-loop evaluation.

Abstract: Service mobile robots are often required to avoid dynamic objects while
performing their tasks, but they usually have only limited computational
resources. So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object
detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates
LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians,
vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1)
a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high
accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference
Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse
trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths.
Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over
existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction
(-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits
exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an
entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To
facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related
code of the method at https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception and its ROS
inference version at https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人混合现实系统需要高频上传高分辨率图像，导致通信能耗高，难以实现绿色通信。

Method: 提出GSRMR方法，利用GS模型生成逼真视图以减少图像上传，并设计GSCLO框架联合优化内容切换和功率分配，采用APO算法求解。

Result: 实验表明，GSRMR将通信能耗降低10倍以上，并在PSNR和SSIM指标上优于基线方案。

Conclusion: GSRMR通过GS模型和GSCLO框架有效降低了RoboMR系统的能耗，为绿色通信提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Realizing green communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems
presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images
at high frequencies through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian
splatting (GS) RoboMR (GSRMR), which achieves a lower energy consumption and
makes a concrete step towards green RoboMR. The crux to GSRMR is to build a GS
model which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a photo-realistic
view from the robot's pose, thereby reducing the need for excessive image
uploads. Since the GS model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual
environments, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further
proposed, which jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to
upload image or not) and power allocation across different frames. The GSCLO
problem is solved by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSRMR reduces the communication
energy by over 10x compared with RoboMR. Furthermore, the proposed GSRMR with
APO outperforms extensive baseline schemes, in terms of peak signal-to-noise
ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM).

Motivation: 现有数据集未能涵盖SLAM和神经渲染的特定挑战，如多模态、时序性、视角和光照条件泛化。

Result: 实验验证了数据集在该新兴领域的基准价值。

Conclusion: SLAM&Render为SLAM与神经渲染的交叉研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Models and methods originally developed for novel view synthesis and scene
rendering, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting, are
increasingly being adopted as representations in Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM). However, existing datasets fail to include the specific
challenges of both fields, such as multimodality and sequentiality in SLAM or
generalization across viewpoints and illumination conditions in neural
rendering. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLAM&Render, a novel dataset
designed to benchmark methods in the intersection between SLAM and novel view
rendering. It consists of 40 sequences with synchronized RGB, depth, IMU, robot
kinematic data, and ground-truth pose streams. By releasing robot kinematic
data, the dataset also enables the assessment of novel SLAM strategies when
applied to robot manipulators. The dataset sequences span five different setups
featuring consumer and industrial objects under four different lighting
conditions, with separate training and test trajectories per scene, as well as
object rearrangements. Our experimental results, obtained with several
baselines from the literature, validate SLAM&Render as a relevant benchmark for
this emerging research area.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的回顾技术，通过闭环训练利用时间数据，使模型能够纠正预测中的系统性错误，显著降低了轨迹预测的误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在自动驾驶中独立进行瞬时轨迹预测，无法纠正推理过程中的错误，导致重复误差。

Method: 提出了一种回顾技术，通过闭环训练和反馈聚合，模型能够分析并纠正之前的预测错误。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse数据集上，最小平均位移误差降低了31.9%，且在处理分布外场景时表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 回顾技术显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和鲁棒性，适用于自动驾驶中的动态场景推理。

Abstract: In automated driving, predicting trajectories of surrounding vehicles
supports reasoning about scene dynamics and enables safe planning for the ego
vehicle. However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task
of forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time
proceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which
means that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat
them. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a
novel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the
model learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on
previous predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of
subsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors
during inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse
demonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up
to 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We
further showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better
handling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users.
