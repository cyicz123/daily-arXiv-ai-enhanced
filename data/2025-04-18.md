### [1] [Unmasking the Reality of PII Masking Models: Performance Gaps and the Call for Accountability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12308)
*Devansh Singh,Sundaraparipurnan Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了隐私掩码技术在数据隐私中的应用，分析了基于NER的PII识别方法的局限性，并通过实验评估了现有模型的隐私暴露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示现有PII识别模型的局限性及其可能导致的隐私泄露问题，尤其是在数据集和NER方法的限制下。

Method: 通过构建包含16种PII类型的17K半合成句子数据集，并在多个维度（如基本实体识别、上下文消歧等）上评估模型性能。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有模型在隐私掩码方面存在显著缺陷，可能导致隐私暴露。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要改进模型性能评估方法，并在模型卡片中提供更多上下文信息以减少隐私风险。

Abstract: Privacy Masking is a critical concept under data privacy involving
anonymization and de-anonymization of personally identifiable information
(PII). Privacy masking techniques rely on Named Entity Recognition (NER)
approaches under NLP support in identifying and classifying named entities in
each text. NER approaches, however, have several limitations including (a)
content sensitivity including ambiguous, polysemic, context dependent or domain
specific content, (b) phrasing variabilities including nicknames and alias,
informal expressions, alternative representations, emerging expressions,
evolving naming conventions and (c) formats or syntax variations, typos,
misspellings. However, there are a couple of PII datasets that have been widely
used by researchers and the open-source community to train models on PII
detection or masking. These datasets have been used to train models including
Piiranha and Starpii, which have been downloaded over 300k and 580k times on
HuggingFace. We examine the quality of the PII masking by these models given
the limitations of the datasets and of the NER approaches. We curate a dataset
of 17K unique, semi-synthetic sentences containing 16 types of PII by compiling
information from across multiple jurisdictions including India, U.K and U.S. We
generate sentences (using language models) containing these PII at five
different NER detection feature dimensions - (1) Basic Entity Recognition, (2)
Contextual Entity Disambiguation, (3) NER in Noisy & Real-World Data, (4)
Evolving & Novel Entities Detection and (5) Cross-Lingual or multi-lingual NER)
and 1 in adversarial context. We present the results and exhibit the privacy
exposure caused by such model use (considering the extent of lifetime downloads
of these models). We conclude by highlighting the gaps in measuring performance
of the models and the need for contextual disclosure in model cards for such
models.

### [2] [Learning Optimal Prompt Ensemble for Multi-source Visual Prompt Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12311)
*Enming Zhang,Liwen Cao,Yanru Wu,Zijie Zhao,Guan Wang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: HGPrompt提出了一种自适应框架，通过优化双重目标（可迁移性和稳定性）来解决多源提示聚合中的表示崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练提示作为重要资产，多源提示的聚合可以提升新任务的泛化能力，但简单聚合会导致表示崩溃。

Method: 引入信息论指标评估提示特征的可迁移性，并提出梯度对齐正则化以减少梯度冲突。

Result: 在大规模VTAB基准测试中，HGPrompt实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HGPrompt有效解决了多源提示迁移中的干扰问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as a lightweight adaptation strategy for adapting
foundation models to downstream tasks, particularly in resource-constrained
systems. As pre-trained prompts have become valuable intellectual assets,
combining multiple source prompts offers a promising approach to enhance
generalization to new tasks by leveraging complementary knowledge from diverse
sources. However, naive aggregation of these prompts often leads to
representation collapse due to mutual interference, undermining their
collective potential. To address these challenges, we propose HGPrompt, an
adaptive framework for multi-source prompt transfer that learns optimal
ensemble weights by jointly optimizing dual objectives: transferability and
stability. Specifically, we first introduce an information-theoretic metric to
evaluate the transferability of prompt-induced features on the target task,
capturing the intrinsic alignment between the feature representations.
Additionally, we propose a novel Gradient Alignment Regularization to mitigate
gradient conflicts among prompts, enabling stable and coherent knowledge
transfer from multiple sources while suppressing interference. Extensive
experiments on the large-scale VTAB benchmark demonstrate that HGPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness in
multi-source prompt transfer.

### [3] [Socrates or Smartypants: Testing Logic Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models with Logic Programming-based Test Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12312)
*Zihao Xu,Junchen Ding,Yiling Lou,Kun Zhang,Dong Gong,Yuekang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文介绍了SmartyPat-Bench和SmartyPat，一个用于评估大语言模型逻辑推理能力的挑战性基准和自动化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集和基准在逻辑推理评估中过于简单或不自然，无法满足需求。

Method: 提出SmartyPat-Bench，基于真实Reddit帖子构建；开发SmartyPat框架，利用逻辑编程和LLM生成自然语言逻辑谬误。

Result: SmartyPat生成的谬误与人工内容相当，且显著优于基线方法；实验揭示LLM在谬误检测和分类中的表现。

Conclusion: SmartyPat-Bench和SmartyPat为逻辑推理评估提供了高质量工具，揭示了LLM在复杂推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in language
understanding and reasoning. Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning
abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and
benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually
constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce
SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled
benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle
logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more
detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To
further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data
collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive
annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic
programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically
generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent
natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation.
Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable
in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly
outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into
LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder
fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy
categorization performance.

### [4] [Exploring the Impact of Personality Traits on Conversational Recommender Systems: A Simulation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12313)
*Xiaoyan Zhao,Yang Deng,Wenjie Wang,Hongzhan lin,Hong Cheng,Rui Zhang,See-Kiong Ng,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的个性化感知用户模拟系统（PerCRS），用于研究人格特质如何影响对话式推荐系统的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人格特质对用户交互行为有显著影响，但目前缺乏对其在对话式推荐系统中作用的研究。

Method: 引入PerCRS系统，用户代理模拟个性化特质和偏好，系统代理具备说服能力以模拟真实交互。采用多角度评估确保鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，LLM能有效生成符合特定人格特质的多样化用户响应，促使推荐系统动态调整策略。

Conclusion: 研究为理解人格特质对对话式推荐系统结果的影响提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) engage users in multi-turn
interactions to deliver personalized recommendations. The emergence of large
language models (LLMs) further enhances these systems by enabling more natural
and dynamic user interactions. However, a key challenge remains in
understanding how personality traits shape conversational recommendation
outcomes. Psychological evidence highlights the influence of personality traits
on user interaction behaviors. To address this, we introduce an LLM-based
personality-aware user simulation for CRSs (PerCRS). The user agent induces
customizable personality traits and preferences, while the system agent
possesses the persuasion capability to simulate realistic interaction in CRSs.
We incorporate multi-aspect evaluation to ensure robustness and conduct
extensive analysis from both user and system perspectives. Experimental results
demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs can effectively generate diverse user
responses aligned with specified personality traits, thereby prompting CRSs to
dynamically adjust their recommendation strategies. Our experimental analysis
offers empirical insights into the impact of personality traits on the outcomes
of conversational recommender systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Mol-Hallu的评估指标，用于量化大语言模型在分子理解任务中的幻觉问题，并提出了幻觉减少后处理阶段（HRPP）以缓解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在分子理解任务中存在幻觉问题，导致药物设计和利用中的错误，亟需解决以提高可靠性。

Method: 分析了PubChem数据集中的知识捷径现象，提出Mol-Hallu评估指标，并设计了HRPP后处理阶段。

Result: 实验表明HRPP能有效减少解码器-编码器分子大语言模型的幻觉。

Conclusion: 研究为减轻幻觉问题、提升大语言模型在科学应用中的可靠性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in scientific domains, especially
for molecular understanding and analysis. However, existing models are affected
by hallucination issues, resulting in errors in drug design and utilization. In
this paper, we first analyze the sources of hallucination in LLMs for molecular
comprehension tasks, specifically the knowledge shortcut phenomenon observed in
the PubChem dataset. To evaluate hallucination in molecular comprehension tasks
with computational efficiency, we introduce \textbf{Mol-Hallu}, a novel
free-form evaluation metric that quantifies the degree of hallucination based
on the scientific entailment relationship between generated text and actual
molecular properties. Utilizing the Mol-Hallu metric, we reassess and analyze
the extent of hallucination in various LLMs performing molecular comprehension
tasks. Furthermore, the Hallucination Reduction Post-processing stage~(HRPP) is
proposed to alleviate molecular hallucinations, Experiments show the
effectiveness of HRPP on decoder-only and encoder-decoder molecular LLMs. Our
findings provide critical insights into mitigating hallucination and improving
the reliability of LLMs in scientific applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于构建和训练多模态数据对的复杂性，开发强大的MLLM仍是一个计算和时间密集型任务。

Abstract: With the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), numerous
outstanding accomplishments have emerged within the open-source community. Due
to the complexity of creating and training multimodal data pairs, it is still a
computational and time-consuming process to build powerful MLLMs. In this work,
we introduce Capybara-OMNI, an MLLM that trains in a lightweight and efficient
manner and supports understanding text, image, video, and audio modalities. We
present in detail the framework design, the data construction, and the training
recipe, to develop an MLLM step-by-step to obtain competitive performance. We
also provide exclusive benchmarks utilized in our experiments to show how to
properly verify understanding capabilities across different modalities. Results
show that by following our guidance, we can efficiently build an MLLM that
achieves competitive performance among models of the same scale on various
multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, to enhance the multimodal instruction
following and conversational capabilities of the model, we further discuss how
to train the chat version upon an MLLM understanding model, which is more in
line with user habits for tasks like real-time interaction with humans. We
publicly disclose the Capybara-OMNI model, along with its chat-based version.
The disclosure includes both the model weights, a portion of the training data,
and the inference codes, which are made available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为“数据代谢”的数据中心框架，用于构建视觉语言模型（VLM），并通过闭环系统持续优化模型性能。发布的Capybara-VL模型在多项任务中表现优异，甚至超越了一些更大的开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据管理对训练强大的视觉语言模型至关重要，但现有方法缺乏系统性。本文旨在通过数据代谢框架解决这一问题。

Method: 提出数据中心框架，包括数据管理和迭代优化，形成闭环系统。详细介绍了数据处理方法和用户特定数据飞轮构建。

Result: 发布的Capybara-VL模型在多项任务中表现优异，超越了一些更大的开源模型，并与领先的专有模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 数据中心框架能够训练更小且高效的视觉语言模型，展示了其巨大潜力。

Abstract: Data curation plays a crucial role in training powerful Visual Language
Models (VLMs). In this work, we introduce the concept of Data Metabolism and
present our data-centric framework to build VLMs throughout the development
lifecycle. Starting from a standard model architecture, we discuss and provide
insights into two crucial development steps: data curation and iteration,
forming a closed-loop system that continuously improves model performance. We
show a detailed codebook on how to process existing massive datasets and build
user-specific data flywheel. As a demonstration, we release a VLM, named
Capybara-VL, which excels in typical multimodal tasks (e.g. , visual question
answering, scientific reasoning, and text-rich tasks). Despite its relatively
compact size, Capybara-VL surpasses several open-source models that are up to
10 times larger in size. Moreover, it achieves results that are on par with
those of several leading proprietary models, demonstrating its remarkable
competitiveness. These results highlight the power of our data-centric
framework and the potential of training smaller and more efficient VLMs.

### [8] [ChatGPT as Linguistic Equalizer? Quantifying LLM-Driven Lexical Shifts in Academic Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12317)
*Dingkang Lin,Naixuan Zhao,Dan Tian,Jiang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: ChatGPT显著提升了非英语母语学者（NNES）在学术写作中的词汇复杂性，减少了语言障碍，促进了学术公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ChatGPT是否能帮助非英语母语学者克服学术写作中的语言障碍，促进学术公平。

Method: 使用MTLD量化词汇复杂性，采用DID设计分析2.8百万篇OpenAlex文章（2020-2024），控制多种变量。

Result: ChatGPT显著提升NNES作者摘要的词汇复杂性，尤其在预印本、技术和生物领域及低级别期刊中效果明显。

Conclusion: ChatGPT有效减少语言差异，推动全球学术公平。

Abstract: The advent of ChatGPT has profoundly reshaped scientific research practices,
particularly in academic writing, where non-native English-speakers (NNES)
historically face linguistic barriers. This study investigates whether ChatGPT
mitigates these barriers and fosters equity by analyzing lexical complexity
shifts across 2.8 million articles from OpenAlex (2020-2024). Using the Measure
of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD) to quantify vocabulary sophistication and a
difference-in-differences (DID) design to identify causal effects, we
demonstrate that ChatGPT significantly enhances lexical complexity in
NNES-authored abstracts, even after controlling for article-level controls,
authorship patterns, and venue norms. Notably, the impact is most pronounced in
preprint papers, technology- and biology-related fields and lower-tier
journals. These findings provide causal evidence that ChatGPT reduces
linguistic disparities and promotes equity in global academia.

### [9] [Has the Creativity of Large-Language Models peaked? An analysis of inter- and intra-LLM variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12320)
*Jennifer Haase,Paul H. P. Hanel,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究发现，尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在创意任务中表现接近或超过人类，但过去18-24个月内其创意能力并未提升，且存在显著的输出不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在创意任务中的表现是否随时间提升，以及其创意输出的稳定性。

Method: 评估14种LLMs（如GPT-4、Claude等）在两种创意测试（DAT和AUT）中的表现。

Result: LLMs创意表现未随时间提升；GPT-4表现下降；部分模型在AUT中优于人类平均水平，但极少达到人类顶尖水平；同一模型输出差异显著。

Conclusion: 需更细致的评估框架，重视模型选择、提示设计和重复测试，以准确评估LLMs的创意潜力。

Abstract: Following the widespread adoption of ChatGPT in early 2023, numerous studies
reported that large language models (LLMs) can match or even surpass human
performance in creative tasks. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs have
become more creative over time, and how consistent their creative output is. In
this study, we evaluated 14 widely used LLMs -- including GPT-4, Claude, Llama,
Grok, Mistral, and DeepSeek -- across two validated creativity assessments: the
Divergent Association Task (DAT) and the Alternative Uses Task (AUT). Contrary
to expectations, we found no evidence of increased creative performance over
the past 18-24 months, with GPT-4 performing worse than in previous studies.
For the more widely used AUT, all models performed on average better than the
average human, with GPT-4o and o3-mini performing best. However, only 0.28% of
LLM-generated responses reached the top 10% of human creativity benchmarks.
Beyond inter-model differences, we document substantial intra-model
variability: the same LLM, given the same prompt, can produce outputs ranging
from below-average to original. This variability has important implications for
both creativity research and practical applications. Ignoring such variability
risks misjudging the creative potential of LLMs, either inflating or
underestimating their capabilities. The choice of prompts affected LLMs
differently. Our findings underscore the need for more nuanced evaluation
frameworks and highlight the importance of model selection, prompt design, and
repeated assessment when using Generative AI (GenAI) tools in creative
contexts.

### [10] [AttentionDefense: Leveraging System Prompt Attention for Explainable Defense Against Novel Jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12321)
*Charlotte Siska,Anush Sankaran*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为AttentionDefense的新方法，利用小型语言模型（SLM）的注意力机制来检测和解释对抗性提示，提供了一种可解释且低成本的防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型（LM）在多领域表现出色，但其易受恶意输入攻击（jailbreak），导致偏离预期行为。现有防御方法难以解释恶意行为的根源，因此需要一种更透明且高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过小型语言模型（SLM）的注意力机制分析对抗性提示，提出AttentionDefense方法，并与现有基准数据集和新型对抗性数据集进行对比验证。

Result: AttentionDefense在检测对抗性提示方面表现优于基于文本嵌入的分类器和GPT-4零样本检测器，且在新型对抗性数据集上保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: AttentionDefense是一种高效、可解释且低成本的防御方法，适用于实际应用，具有小型语言模型的计算需求和大型语言模型的检测性能。

Abstract: In the past few years, Language Models (LMs) have shown par-human
capabilities in several domains. Despite their practical applications and
exceeding user consumption, they are susceptible to jailbreaks when malicious
input exploits the LM's weaknesses, causing it to deviate from its intended
behavior. Current defensive strategies either classify the input prompt as
adversarial or prevent LMs from generating harmful outputs. However, it is
challenging to explain the reason behind the malicious nature of the jailbreak,
which results in a wide variety of closed-box approaches. In this research, we
propose and demonstrate that system-prompt attention from Small Language Models
(SLMs) can be used to characterize adversarial prompts, providing a novel,
explainable, and cheaper defense approach called AttentionDefense. Our research
suggests that the attention mechanism is an integral component in understanding
and explaining how LMs respond to malicious input that is not captured in the
semantic meaning of text embeddings. The proposed AttentionDefense is evaluated
against existing jailbreak benchmark datasets. Ablation studies show that
SLM-based AttentionDefense has equivalent or better jailbreak detection
performance compared to text embedding-based classifiers and GPT-4 zero-shot
detectors.To further validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we
generate a dataset of novel jailbreak variants of the existing benchmark
dataset using a closed-loop LLM-based multi-agent system. We demonstrate that
the proposed AttentionDefense approach performs robustly on this novel
jailbreak dataset while existing approaches suffer in performance.
Additionally, for practical purposes AttentionDefense is an ideal solution as
it has the computation requirements of a small LM but the performance of a LLM
detector.

*Xin Gao,Qizhi Pei,Zinan Tang,Yu Li,Honglin Lin,Jiang Wu,Conghui He,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为GRA的框架，通过多个小型LLM协作模拟同行评审流程，实现高质量数据合成，挑战了大型LLM的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据合成方法依赖大型LLM，存在高成本、低效率和潜在偏见问题，而小型LLM能力有限。GRA框架旨在通过协作小型LLM解决这些问题。

Method: GRA框架将数据合成任务分解为Generator、Reviewer和Adjudicator三个角色，模拟同行评审流程进行迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明，GRA生成的数据质量与大型LLM（如Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct）相当或更优。

Conclusion: GRA证明了小型LLM协作可以替代大型LLM进行高质量数据合成，为可持续和高效的方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance
small language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models
(LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency,
and potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures. In contrast,
smaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual
capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable
data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose
a multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized
roles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically
achieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small
LLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a
peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial
data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the
Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the
synthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can
achieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. Through
experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data
matches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs, e.g.,
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large
models for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic
coordination of smaller agents. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly
available at https://github.com/GX-XinGao/GRA.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: RAG通过检索外部知识增强LLMs，减少错误内容生成，但可能影响公平性。研究发现小规模LLMs（<8B）的公平性问题更严重，并提出FairFT和FairFilter两种方法改善公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RAG对LLMs公平性的影响，尤其是在社会影响较大的领域。

Method: 通过实验分析不同规模LLMs、检索器和检索源的影响，并提出FairFT（公平对齐检索器）和FairFilter（公平过滤机制）两种方法。

Result: 小规模LLMs（如LLaMA3.2-1B）在RAG框架下公平性问题更突出，提出的方法能有效改善公平性且不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: RAG对小规模LLMs的公平性有负面影响，但通过FairFT和FairFilter可以显著缓解这一问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant document from external knowledge sources. By referencing
this external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the generation of factually
incorrect content and addresses hallucination issues within LLMs. Recently,
there has been growing attention to improving the performance and efficiency of
RAG systems from various perspectives. While these advancements have yielded
significant results, the application of RAG in domains with considerable
societal implications raises a critical question about fairness: What impact
does the introduction of the RAG paradigm have on the fairness of LLMs? To
address this question, we conduct extensive experiments by varying the LLMs,
retrievers, and retrieval sources. Our experimental analysis reveals that the
scale of the LLMs plays a significant role in influencing fairness outcomes
within the RAG framework. When the model scale is smaller than 8B, the
integration of retrieval mechanisms often exacerbates unfairness in small-scale
LLMs (e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA3-8B). To mitigate the fairness
issues introduced by RAG for small-scale LLMs, we propose two approaches,
FairFT and FairFilter. Specifically, in FairFT, we align the retriever with the
LLM in terms of fairness, enabling it to retrieve documents that facilitate
fairer model outputs. In FairFilter, we propose a fairness filtering mechanism
to filter out biased content after retrieval. Finally, we validate our proposed
approaches on real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in
improving fairness while maintaining performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文提出了一种新的跨文档跨语言自然语言推理（CDCL-NLI）范式，构建了一个高质量的多语言数据集，并提出了一种结合RST增强图融合和可解释性预测的创新方法。实验表明该方法优于传统NLI模型和大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨文档跨语言自然语言推理（CDCL-NLI）是一个未被充分探索的领域，本文旨在扩展NLI能力到多文档、多语言场景。

Method: 提出了一种结合RST增强图融合和可解释性预测的方法，使用RGAT进行跨文档上下文建模，并通过基于词汇链的结构感知语义对齐机制实现跨语言理解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能上显著优于传统NLI模型（如DocNLI和R2F）和大型语言模型（如Llama3和GPT-4o）。

Conclusion: 本文为NLI研究提供了新视角，并推动了跨文档跨语言上下文理解、语义检索和可解释性推理的研究兴趣。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a fundamental task in both natural
language processing and information retrieval. While NLI has developed many
sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual
NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for CDCL-NLI that extends traditional
NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this
task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 1,110 instances
and spanning 26 languages. To build a baseline for this task, we also propose
an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion and
interpretability prediction. Our method employs RST (Rhetorical Structure
Theory) on RGAT (Relation-aware Graph Attention Network) for cross-document
context modeling, coupled with a structure-aware semantic alignment mechanism
based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI
interpretability, we develop an EDU-level attribution framework that generates
extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's
superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both traditional
NLI models such as DocNLI and R2F, as well as LLMs like Llama3 and GPT-4o. Our
work sheds light on the study of NLI and will bring research interest on
cross-document cross-lingual context understanding, semantic retrieval and
interpretability inference. Our dataset and code are available at

Result: LLMTaxo能有效分类社交媒体事实声明，某些模型在特定数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: LLMTaxo为社交媒体内容分类提供了有效工具，模型选择需根据数据集特性调整。

Abstract: With the vast expansion of content on social media platforms, analyzing and
comprehending online discourse has become increasingly complex. This paper
introduces LLMTaxo, a novel framework leveraging large language models for the
automated construction of taxonomy of factual claims from social media by
generating topics from multi-level granularities. This approach aids
stakeholders in more effectively navigating the social media landscapes. We
implement this framework with different models across three distinct datasets
and introduce specially designed taxonomy evaluation metrics for a
comprehensive assessment. With the evaluations from both human evaluators and
GPT-4, the results indicate that LLMTaxo effectively categorizes factual claims
from social media, and reveals that certain models perform better on specific
datasets.

### [15] [Reconstructing Sepsis Trajectories from Clinical Case Reports using LLMs: the Textual Time Series Corpus for Sepsis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12326)
*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Jeremy C. Weiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLMs）从临床病例报告和出院摘要中提取时间定位发现的管道，并构建了一个开放访问的Sepsis-3文本时间序列语料库。验证结果显示LLMs在时间定位和临床发现恢复方面表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床病例报告和出院摘要虽然完整准确，但通常在患者接触后才完成。结构化数据流虽更早可用但不完整。研究旨在利用LLMs生成更完整且时间粒度更细的数据。

Method: 构建了一个管道，利用LLMs对病例报告中的时间定位发现进行表型提取和注释，并应用于生成Sepsis-3的文本时间序列语料库。

Result: 验证结果显示高恢复率（事件匹配率：O1-preview--0.755，Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753）和强时间顺序一致性（一致性：O1-preview--0.932，Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.932）。

Conclusion: LLMs在时间定位临床发现方面表现良好，但也存在局限性，未来可通过多模态集成改进。

Abstract: Clinical case reports and discharge summaries may be the most complete and
accurate summarization of patient encounters, yet they are finalized, i.e.,
timestamped after the encounter. Complementary data structured streams become
available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms
on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to
phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports
using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access
textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the
Pubmed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it on PMOA
and timeline annotations from I2B2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to
physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings
(event match rates: O1-preview--0.755, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753) and
strong temporal ordering (concordance: O1-preview--0.932, Llama 3.3 70B
Instruct--0.932). Our work characterizes the ability of LLMs to time-localize
clinical findings in text, illustrating the limitations of LLM use for temporal
reconstruction and providing several potential avenues of improvement via
multimodal integration.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该论文通过分析中国官方媒体（1950-2019）的语言模式，揭示了社会群体在语言中的表征如何反映革命性社会变革，并与西方语境形成对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在量化分析中国官方媒体如何通过语言编码社会群体的表征，填补非西方语境下语言与社会结构关系的研究空白。

Method: 使用历时词嵌入方法，在不同时间分辨率下分析中国官方媒体的语言数据。

Result: 发现中国社会群体的表征与西方显著不同，尤其是经济地位、种族和性别；性别和经济阶层的表征随历史变革剧烈变化，而种族、年龄和体型等刻板印象则相对稳定。

Conclusion: 研究强调了非西方视角在计算社会科学中的重要性，并揭示了官方话语如何通过语言编码社会结构。

Abstract: Language encodes societal beliefs about social groups through word patterns.
While computational methods like word embeddings enable quantitative analysis
of these patterns, studies have primarily examined gradual shifts in Western
contexts. We present the first large-scale computational analysis of Chinese
state-controlled media (1950-2019) to examine how revolutionary social
transformations are reflected in official linguistic representations of social
groups. Using diachronic word embeddings at multiple temporal resolutions, we
find that Chinese representations differ significantly from Western
counterparts, particularly regarding economic status, ethnicity, and gender.
These representations show distinct evolutionary dynamics: while stereotypes of
ethnicity, age, and body type remain remarkably stable across political
upheavals, representations of gender and economic classes undergo dramatic
shifts tracking historical transformations. This work advances our
understanding of how officially sanctioned discourse encodes social structure
through language while highlighting the importance of non-Western perspectives
in computational social science.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为“推测性思考”的无训练框架，通过大模型指导小模型在推理层面提升性能，显著提高了推理准确性和输出效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练方法成本高且输出冗长，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用大模型控制小模型的反射行为，减少回溯并提升推理质量。

Result: 1.5B模型在MATH500上的准确率从83.2%提升至89.4%，输出长度减少15.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了推理模型的性能，同时缩短了输出长度，适用于非推理模型。

Abstract: Recent advances leverage post-training to enhance model reasoning
performance, which typically requires costly training pipelines and still
suffers from inefficient, overly lengthy outputs. We introduce Speculative
Thinking, a training-free framework that enables large reasoning models to
guide smaller ones during inference at the reasoning level, distinct from
speculative decoding, which operates at the token level. Our approach is based
on two observations: (1) reasoning-supportive tokens such as "wait" frequently
appear after structural delimiters like "\n\n", serving as signals for
reflection or continuation; and (2) larger models exhibit stronger control over
reflective behavior, reducing unnecessary backtracking while improving
reasoning quality. By strategically delegating reflective steps to a more
capable model, our method significantly boosts the reasoning accuracy of
reasoning models while shortening their output. With the assistance of the 32B
reasoning model, the 1.5B model's accuracy on MATH500 increases from 83.2% to
89.4%, marking a substantial improvement of 6.2%. Simultaneously, the average
output length is reduced from 5439 tokens to 4583 tokens, representing a 15.7%
decrease. Moreover, when applied to a non-reasoning model
(Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct), our framework boosts its accuracy from 74.0% to 81.8%
on the same benchmark, achieving a relative improvement of 7.8%.

Motivation: 传统单代理RAG在处理跨异构数据生态系统的复杂查询时存在局限性，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用三层架构：分解代理、多源检索代理和决策代理，结合语义查询重写、并行检索和一致性投票。

Result: 在ScienceQA和CrisisMMD基准测试中，答案准确性提升12.95%，问题分类准确性提升3.56%。

Conclusion: HM-RAG在多模态推理和知识合成方面取得了显著进展，模块化架构支持新数据模态的无缝集成。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models
(LLMs) with external knowledge, conventional single-agent RAG remains
fundamentally limited in resolving complex queries demanding coordinated
reasoning across heterogeneous data ecosystems. We present HM-RAG, a novel
Hierarchical Multi-agent Multimodal RAG framework that pioneers collaborative
intelligence for dynamic knowledge synthesis across structured, unstructured,
and graph-based data. The framework is composed of three-tiered architecture
with specialized agents: a Decomposition Agent that dissects complex queries
into contextually coherent sub-tasks via semantic-aware query rewriting and
schema-guided context augmentation; Multi-source Retrieval Agents that carry
out parallel, modality-specific retrieval using plug-and-play modules designed
for vector, graph, and web-based databases; and a Decision Agent that uses
consistency voting to integrate multi-source answers and resolve discrepancies
in retrieval results through Expert Model Refinement. This architecture attains
comprehensive query understanding by combining textual, graph-relational, and
web-derived evidence, resulting in a remarkable 12.95% improvement in answer
accuracy and a 3.56% boost in question classification accuracy over baseline
RAG systems on the ScienceQA and CrisisMMD benchmarks. Notably, HM-RAG
establishes state-of-the-art results in zero-shot settings on both datasets.
Its modular architecture ensures seamless integration of new data modalities
while maintaining strict data governance, marking a significant advancement in
addressing the critical challenges of multimodal reasoning and knowledge
synthesis in RAG systems. Code is available at

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种基于大语言模型的细粒度情感-原因-类别三元组提取方法，通过指令调优和数据增强技术显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在情感-原因对提取和检测中存在冗余信息检索和情感类别确定困难的问题，尤其是隐式或模糊情感表达时。

Method: 采用任务特定的三元组提取指令和低秩适应技术微调大语言模型，无需复杂任务架构，并结合提示数据增强策略生成高质量合成数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在情感-原因-类别三元组提取指标上至少提升12.8%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且鲁棒，为情感原因分析研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction represents a novel and
complex challenge within emotion cause analysis. This task involves identifying
emotion spans, cause spans, and their associated emotion categories within the
text to form structured triplets. While prior research has predominantly
concentrated on clause-level emotion-cause pair extraction and span-level
emotion-cause detection, these methods often confront challenges originating
from redundant information retrieval and difficulty in accurately determining
emotion categories, particularly when emotions are expressed implicitly or
ambiguously. To overcome these challenges, this study explores a fine-grained
approach to span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction and introduces
an innovative framework that leverages instruction tuning and data augmentation
techniques based on large language models. The proposed method employs
task-specific triplet extraction instructions and utilizes low-rank adaptation
to fine-tune large language models, eliminating the necessity for intricate
task-specific architectures. Furthermore, a prompt-based data augmentation
strategy is developed to address data scarcity by guiding large language models
in generating high-quality synthetic training data. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing baseline methods, achieving at least a 12.8% improvement in span-level
emotion-cause-category triplet extraction metrics. The results demonstrate the
method's effectiveness and robustness, offering a promising avenue for
advancing research in emotion cause analysis. The source code is available at

Motivation: 探讨LLM能力是否真正接近人类能力，并量化其表现。

Method: 收集80多个LLM在37个基准上的数据，按人类能力的6个主要类别和11个子类别分类，聚类性能排名并与人类能力分类对比。

Result: 1. 部分LLM能力可用人类指标描述；2. 人类相关能力在LLM中不相关；3. LLM能力随参数规模变化显著。

Conclusion: LLM能力与人类能力部分重叠但存在显著差异，且受参数规模影响。

Abstract: Users of Large Language Models (LLMs) often perceive these models as
intelligent entities with human-like capabilities. However, the extent to which
LLMs' capabilities truly approximate human abilities remains a topic of debate.
In this paper, to characterize the capabilities of LLMs in relation to human
capabilities, we collected performance data from over 80 models across 37
evaluation benchmarks. The evaluation benchmarks are categorized into 6 primary
abilities and 11 sub-abilities in human aspect. Then, we then clustered the
performance rankings into several categories and compared these clustering
results with classifications based on human ability aspects. Our findings lead
to the following conclusions: 1. We have confirmed that certain capabilities of
LLMs with fewer than 10 billion parameters can indeed be described using human
ability metrics; 2. While some abilities are considered interrelated in humans,
they appear nearly uncorrelated in LLMs; 3. The capabilities possessed by LLMs
vary significantly with the parameter scale of the model.

Motivation: 评估开放式回答在严肃游戏中的主观性挑战，以及小型LLMs作为评估工具的准确性和一致性尚不明确。

Method: 使用传统二元分类指标（如准确率、真阳性率、真阴性率）系统比较五种小型LLMs在不同评估场景下的表现。

Result: 某些模型在识别正确答案上表现优异，而其他模型则存在假阳性或不一致评估的问题。

Conclusion: 研究强调了上下文感知评估框架和谨慎选择模型的重要性，为AI驱动评估工具的可信度提供了见解。

Abstract: The evaluation of open-ended responses in serious games presents a unique
challenge, as correctness is often subjective. Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly being explored as evaluators in such contexts, yet their accuracy
and consistency remain uncertain, particularly for smaller models intended for
local execution. This study investigates the reliability of five small-scale
LLMs when assessing player responses in \textit{En-join}, a game that simulates
decision-making within energy communities. By leveraging traditional binary
classification metrics (including accuracy, true positive rate, and true
negative rate), we systematically compare these models across different
evaluation scenarios. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of
each model, revealing trade-offs between sensitivity, specificity, and overall
performance. We demonstrate that while some models excel at identifying correct
responses, others struggle with false positives or inconsistent evaluations.
The findings highlight the need for context-aware evaluation frameworks and
careful model selection when deploying LLMs as evaluators. This work
contributes to the broader discourse on the trustworthiness of AI-driven
assessment tools, offering insights into how different LLM architectures handle
subjective evaluation tasks.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在复杂医学任务中因术语和临床数据敏感性导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出QM-ToT框架，结合树状思维分解问题和评估层，并设计基于ToT的数据蒸馏方法。

Result: LLaMA2-70b准确率从34%提升至50%，LLaMA-3.1-8b从58.77%提升至69.49%；数据蒸馏效率提升86.27%。

Conclusion: QM-ToT首次展示了ToT在复杂医学任务中的潜力，为资源受限环境下的高性能量化模型部署奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized
biomedical tasks due to the inherent complexity of medical reasoning and the
sensitive nature of clinical data. Existing LLMs often struggle with intricate
medical terminology and the need for accurate clinical insights, leading to
performance reduction when quantized for resource-constrained deployment. To
address these issues, we propose Quantized Medical Tree of Thought (QM-ToT), a
path-based reasoning framework. QM-ToT leverages a Tree of Thought (ToT)
reasoning approach to decompose complex medical problems into manageable
subtasks, coupled with evaluator assessment layers. This framework facilitates
substantial performance improvements in INT4-quantized models on the
challenging MedQAUSMLE dataset. Specifically, we demonstrate a remarkable
accuracy increase from 34% to 50% for the LLaMA2-70b model and from 58.77% to
69.49% for LLaMA-3.1-8b. Besides, we also proposed an effect data distillation
method based on ToT. Compared to the traditional distillation method, we
achieved an improvement of 86. 27% while using only 3.9% of the data.This work,
for the first time, showcases the potential of ToT to significantly enhance
performance on complex biomedical tasks, establishing a crucial foundation for
future advances in deploying high-performing quantized LLM in resource-limited
medical settings.

Conclusion: 该方法能高效监测LLM变化，减少计算开销。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often provided as a service via an API,
making it challenging for developers to detect changes in their behavior. We
present an approach to monitor LLMs for changes by comparing the distributions
of linguistic and psycholinguistic features of generated text. Our method uses
a statistical test to determine whether the distributions of features from two
samples of text are equivalent, allowing developers to identify when an LLM has
changed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using five OpenAI
completion models and Meta's Llama 3 70B chat model. Our results show that
simple text features coupled with a statistical test can distinguish between
language models. We also explore the use of our approach to detect prompt
injection attacks. Our work enables frequent LLM change monitoring and avoids
computationally expensive benchmark evaluations.

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI聊天机器人（如ChatGPT）在非正式心理健康支持中的角色及其新兴能力。

Method: 通过分析10,000多条TikTok评论，使用分层编码和监督分类模型识别用户体验和主题。

Result: 20%的评论反映个人使用，用户态度积极，主要受益包括可访问性和情感支持，但也存在隐私和监管问题。

Conclusion: AI在心理健康支持中的应用日益重要，但需加强临床和伦理审查。

Abstract: The emergence of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT has prompted growing
public and academic interest in their role as informal mental health support
tools. While early rule-based systems have been around for several years, large
language models (LLMs) offer new capabilities in conversational fluency,
empathy simulation, and availability. This study explores how users engage with
LLMs as mental health tools by analyzing over 10,000 TikTok comments from
videos referencing LLMs as mental health tools. Using a self-developed tiered
coding schema and supervised classification models, we identify user
experiences, attitudes, and recurring themes. Results show that nearly 20% of
comments reflect personal use, with these users expressing overwhelmingly
positive attitudes. Commonly cited benefits include accessibility, emotional
support, and perceived therapeutic value. However, concerns around privacy,
generic responses, and the lack of professional oversight remain prominent. It
is important to note that the user feedback does not indicate which therapeutic
framework, if any, the LLM-generated output aligns with. While the findings
underscore the growing relevance of AI in everyday practices, they also
highlight the urgent need for clinical and ethical scrutiny in the use of AI
for mental health support.

Conclusion: LLMs在临床预测任务中具有显著价值，未来可广泛应用于其他未充分利用文本数据的领域。

Abstract: There is a long history of building predictive models in healthcare using
tabular data from electronic medical records. However, these models fail to
extract the information found in unstructured clinical notes, which document
diagnosis, treatment, progress, medications, and care plans. In this study, we
investigate how answers generated by GPT-4o-mini (ChatGPT) to simple clinical
questions about patients, when given access to the patient's discharge summary,
can support patient-level mortality prediction. Using data from 14,011
first-time admissions to the Coronary Care or Cardiovascular Intensive Care
Units in the MIMIC-IV Note dataset, we implement a transparent framework that
uses GPT responses as input features in logistic regression models. Our
findings demonstrate that GPT-based models alone can outperform models trained
on standard tabular data, and that combining both sources of information yields
even greater predictive power, increasing AUC by an average of 5.1 percentage
points and increasing positive predictive value by 29.9 percent for the
highest-risk decile. These results highlight the value of integrating large
language models (LLMs) into clinical prediction tasks and underscore the
broader potential for using LLMs in any domain where unstructured text data

Result: GOAT-TTS性能与SOTA模型相当，并验证了方言语音合成的有效性。

Conclusion: GOAT-TTS通过双分支设计有效解决了现有TTS模型的局限性，展现了实际应用潜力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-to-speech (TTS)
synthesis through discrete tokenization paradigms, current architectures
exhibit fundamental tensions between three critical dimensions: 1) irreversible
loss of acoustic characteristics caused by quantization of speech prompts; 2)
stringent dependence on precisely aligned prompt speech-text pairs that limit
real-world deployment; and 3) catastrophic forgetting of the LLM's native text
comprehension during optimization for speech token generation. To address these
challenges, we propose an LLM-based text-to-speech Generation approach
Optimized via a novel dual-branch ArchiTecture (GOAT-TTS). Our framework
introduces two key innovations: (1) The modality-alignment branch combines a
speech encoder and projector to capture continuous acoustic embeddings,
enabling bidirectional correlation between paralinguistic features (language,
timbre, emotion) and semantic text representations without transcript
dependency; (2) The speech-generation branch employs modular fine-tuning on
top-k layers of an LLM for speech token prediction while freezing the bottom-k
layers to preserve foundational linguistic knowledge. Moreover, multi-token
prediction is introduced to support real-time streaming TTS synthesis.
Experimental results demonstrate that our GOAT-TTS achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art TTS models while validating the efficacy of
synthesized dialect speech data.

Method: 提出BRAGE基准，支持多语言，并设计基于引用的分类方法评估QRUC。

Result: 实验表明主流LLM在生物制药QRUC上存在显著差距，需改进。

Conclusion: BRAGE为生物制药领域LLM评估提供了新工具，基于引用的方法有效评估QRUC。

Abstract: Recently, the application of the retrieval-augmented Large Language Models
(LLMs) in specific domains has gained significant attention, especially in
biopharmaceuticals. However, in this context, there is no benchmark
specifically designed for biopharmaceuticals to evaluate LLMs. In this paper,
we introduce the Biopharmaceuticals Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation
(BRAGE) , the first benchmark tailored for evaluating LLMs' Query and Reference
Understanding Capability (QRUC) in the biopharmaceutical domain, available in
English, French, German and Chinese. In addition, Traditional
Question-Answering (QA) metrics like accuracy and exact match fall short in the
open-ended retrieval-augmented QA scenarios. To address this, we propose a
citation-based classification method to evaluate the QRUC of LLMs to understand
the relationship between queries and references. We apply this method to
evaluate the mainstream LLMs on BRAGE. Experimental results show that there is
a significant gap in the biopharmaceutical QRUC of mainstream LLMs, and their
QRUC needs to be improved.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）的语义后门攻击及其检测框架RAVEN，揭示了隐藏的概念级漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统防御方法仅关注显式的词级异常，忽略了语义后门攻击，即通过概念级触发器（如意识形态或文化引用）操纵模型输出。

Method: 在微调环境中植入语义后门，并提出了RAVEN框架，结合语义熵和跨模型一致性分析，通过主题-视角提示探测模型响应并聚类分析。

Result: 实验在多类LLM（如GPT-4o、Llama等）中发现了未检测到的语义后门，验证了概念级审计的必要性。

Conclusion: 语义后门攻击具有实际可行性，RAVEN框架为检测此类漏洞提供了有效工具，强调了部署语言模型时概念级审计的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across myriad
language tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries implant hidden triggers that systematically manipulate model
outputs. Traditional defenses focus on explicit token-level anomalies and
therefore overlook semantic backdoors-covert triggers embedded at the
conceptual level (e.g., ideological stances or cultural references) that rely
on meaning-based cues rather than lexical oddities. We first show, in a
controlled finetuning setting, that such semantic backdoors can be implanted
with only a small poisoned corpus, establishing their practical feasibility. We
then formalize the notion of semantic backdoors in LLMs and introduce a
black-box detection framework, RAVEN (short for "Response Anomaly Vigilance for
uncovering semantic backdoors"), which combines semantic entropy with
cross-model consistency analysis. The framework probes multiple models with
structured topic-perspective prompts, clusters the sampled responses via
bidirectional entailment, and flags anomalously uniform outputs; cross-model
comparison isolates model-specific anomalies from corpus-wide biases. Empirical
evaluations across diverse LLM families (GPT-4o, Llama, DeepSeek, Mistral)
uncover previously undetected semantic backdoors, providing the first
proof-of-concept evidence of these hidden vulnerabilities and underscoring the
urgent need for concept-level auditing of deployed language models. We
open-source our code and data at https://github.com/NayMyatMin/RAVEN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市因果研究面临假设生成效率低、数据复杂性高和方法脆弱性等挑战，LLMs为改进提供了新机会。

Method: 提出AutoUrbanCI框架，包含四个模块化代理：假设生成、数据工程、实验设计与执行、结果解释与政策建议。

Result: 框架旨在提高研究的严谨性和透明度，促进人机协作、公平性和问责制。

Conclusion: 呼吁将AI作为工具而非替代，以扩大参与、提高可重复性，实现更包容的城市因果推理。

Abstract: Urban causal research is essential for understanding the complex dynamics of
cities and informing evidence-based policies. However, it is challenged by the
inefficiency and bias of hypothesis generation, barriers to multimodal data
complexity, and the methodological fragility of causal experimentation. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to rethink how
urban causal analysis is conducted. This Perspective examines current urban
causal research by analyzing taxonomies that categorize research topics, data
sources, and methodological approaches to identify structural gaps. We then
introduce an LLM-driven conceptual framework, AutoUrbanCI, composed of four
distinct modular agents responsible for hypothesis generation, data
engineering, experiment design and execution, and results interpretation with
policy recommendations. We propose evaluation criteria for rigor and
transparency and reflect on implications for human-AI collaboration, equity,
and accountability. We call for a new research agenda that embraces
AI-augmented workflows not as replacements for human expertise but as tools to
broaden participation, improve reproducibility, and unlock more inclusive forms
of urban causal reasoning.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在数学推理方面的能力，探索其在教育评估中的潜力。

Method: 使用芬兰高考数学考试对多种LLMs进行测试。

Result: 初期表现中等，后期显著提升，部分模型达到满分。

Conclusion: LLMs数学能力进步迅速，有望支持大规模教育评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing promise in educational
settings, yet their mathematical reasoning has been considered evolving. This
study evaluates the mathematical capabilities of various LLMs using the Finnish
matriculation examination, a high-stakes digital test for upper secondary
education. Initial tests yielded moderate performance corresponding to
mid-range grades, but later evaluations demonstrated substantial improvements
as the language models evolved. Remarkably, some models achieved near-perfect
or perfect scores, matching top student performance and qualifying for
university admission. Our findings highlight the rapid advances in the
mathematical proficiency of LLMs and illustrate their potential to also support
educational assessments at scale.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种将病例报告转化为结构化时间序列数据的系统，对比了人工和LLM标注的效果，发现LLM在事件召回率和时间一致性上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床事件的时间信息对患者轨迹分析至关重要，但现有电子健康记录缺乏结构化时间数据。

Method: 开发了一个系统，将病例报告转化为文本时间序列数据，并对比了人工和LLM标注的效果。

Result: LLM在事件召回率上表现中等（0.80），但在时间一致性上表现优异（0.95）。

Conclusion: 该研究为利用PMOA语料库进行时间分析提供了基准。

Abstract: Timing of clinical events is central to characterization of patient
trajectories, enabling analyses such as process tracing, forecasting, and
causal reasoning. However, structured electronic health records capture few
data elements critical to these tasks, while clinical reports lack temporal
localization of events in structured form. We present a system that transforms
case reports into textual time series-structured pairs of textual events and
timestamps. We contrast manual and large language model (LLM) annotations
(n=320 and n=390 respectively) of ten randomly-sampled PubMed open-access
(PMOA) case reports (N=152,974) and assess inter-LLM agreement (n=3,103; N=93).
We find that the LLM models have moderate event recall(O1-preview: 0.80) but
high temporal concordance among identified events (O1-preview: 0.95). By
establishing the task, annotation, and assessment systems, and by demonstrating
high concordance, this work may serve as a benchmark for leveraging the PMOA
corpus for temporal analytics.

Conclusion: AI框架在公共卫生监测和个性化干预中具有潜力。

Abstract: Drug overdose remains a critical global health issue, often driven by misuse
of opioids, painkillers, and psychiatric medications. Traditional research
methods face limitations, whereas social media offers real-time insights into
self-reported substance use and overdose symptoms. This study proposes an
AI-driven NLP framework trained on annotated social media data to detect
commonly used drugs and associated overdose symptoms. Using a hybrid annotation
strategy with LLMs and human annotators, we applied traditional ML models,
neural networks, and advanced transformer-based models. Our framework achieved
98% accuracy in multi-class and 97% in multi-label classification,
outperforming baseline models by up to 8%. These findings highlight the

Abstract: Validating Large Language Models with ReLM explores the application of formal
languages to evaluate and control Large Language Models (LLMs) for
memorization, bias, and zero-shot performance. Current approaches for
evaluating these types behavior are often slow, imprecise, costly, or introduce
biases of their own, but are necessary due to the importance of this behavior
when productionizing LLMs. This project reproduces key results from the
original ReLM paper and expounds on the approach and applications with an
emphasis on the relevance to the field of systems for machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM训练数据的背后是大量未获补偿的人力劳动，论文旨在量化这一成本并推动公平补偿。

Method: 研究64个2016-2024年间发布的LLM，估算从零开始生产其训练数据所需的人力成本。

Result: 即使保守估计工资，训练数据成本是模型训练成本的10-1000倍，构成LLM提供商的重大财务负担。

Conclusion: 论文强调训练数据的价值与补偿之间的巨大差距，并提出未来研究方向以实现更公平的实践。

Abstract: Training a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) is an increasingly
expensive endeavor due to growing computational, hardware, energy, and
engineering demands. Yet, an often-overlooked (and seldom paid) expense is the
human labor behind these models' training data. Every LLM is built on an
unfathomable amount of human effort: trillions of carefully written words
sourced from books, academic papers, codebases, social media, and more. This
position paper aims to assign a monetary value to this labor and argues that
the most expensive part of producing an LLM should be the compensation provided
to training data producers for their work. To support this position, we study
64 LLMs released between 2016 and 2024, estimating what it would cost to pay
people to produce their training datasets from scratch. Even under highly
conservative estimates of wage rates, the costs of these models' training
datasets are 10-1000 times larger than the costs to train the models
themselves, representing a significant financial liability for LLM providers.
In the face of the massive gap between the value of training data and the lack
of compensation for its creation, we highlight and discuss research directions
that could enable fairer practices in the future.

Conclusion: 线性表示的强度揭示了预训练数据的特征，为优化模型行为提供了新途径。

Abstract: Pretraining data has a direct impact on the behaviors and quality of language
models (LMs), but we only understand the most basic principles of this
relationship. While most work focuses on pretraining data's effect on
downstream task behavior, we investigate its relationship to LM
representations. Previous work has discovered that, in language models, some
concepts are encoded `linearly' in the representations, but what factors cause
these representations to form? We study the connection between pretraining data
frequency and models' linear representations of factual relations. We find
evidence that the formation of linear representations is strongly connected to
pretraining term frequencies; specifically for subject-relation-object fact
triplets, both subject-object co-occurrence frequency and in-context learning
accuracy for the relation are highly correlated with linear representations.
This is the case across all phases of pretraining. In OLMo-7B and GPT-J, we
discover that a linear representation consistently (but not exclusively) forms
when the subjects and objects within a relation co-occur at least 1k and 2k
times, respectively, regardless of when these occurrences happen during
pretraining. Finally, we train a regression model on measurements of linear
representation quality in fully-trained LMs that can predict how often a term
was seen in pretraining. Our model achieves low error even on inputs from a
different model with a different pretraining dataset, providing a new method
for estimating properties of the otherwise-unknown training data of closed-data
models. We conclude that the strength of linear representations in LMs contains
signal about the models' pretraining corpora that may provide new avenues for
controlling and improving model behavior: particularly, manipulating the
models' training data to meet specific frequency thresholds.

Motivation: 研究动机在于现有自动谬误检测数据集多限于正式语言领域（如政治辩论或新闻报道），而在线论坛的非标准化语言未被充分覆盖。

Method: 提出SLURG方法，利用DeepHermes-3-Mistral-24B等大语言模型生成合成谬误论坛评论，并通过高质量少样本提示增强模型能力。

Result: 研究发现大语言模型能复制真实数据的句法模式，且高质量少样本提示可提升模型对论坛词汇多样性的模仿能力。

Conclusion: 结论表明大语言模型在生成合成谬误评论方面具有潜力，为在线论坛谬误检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: In our paper we explore the definition, and extrapolation of fallacies as
they pertain to the automatic detection of manipulation on social media. In
particular we explore how these logical fallacies might appear in the real
world i.e internet forums. We discovered a prevalence of misinformation /
misguided intention in discussion boards specifically centered around the
Ukrainian Russian Conflict which serves to narrow the domain of our task.
Although automatic fallacy detection has gained attention recently, most
datasets use unregulated fallacy taxonomies or are limited to formal linguistic
domains like political debates or news reports. Online discourse, however,
often features non-standardized and diverse language not captured in these
domains. We present Shady Linguistic Utterance Replication-Generation (SLURG)
to address these limitations, exploring the feasibility of generating synthetic
fallacious forum-style comments using large language models (LLMs),
specifically DeepHermes-3-Mistral-24B. Our findings indicate that LLMs can
replicate the syntactic patterns of real data} and that high-quality few-shot
prompts enhance LLMs' ability to mimic the vocabulary diversity of online
forums.

<details>

Motivation: 解决文本属性图（TAGs）中同时建模文本语义和结构依赖的挑战，弥补GNN和LLM各自的不足。

Method: 提出BiGTex架构，通过堆叠的图文本融合单元实现双向注意力机制，使用LoRA进行参数高效微调。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上实现了节点分类和链接预测的最优性能。

Conclusion: BiGTex通过双向融合和软提示技术，显著提升了文本属性图的表示学习能力。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation
learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of
node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph. While graph
neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the
capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs)
are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph
structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel
architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text
Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and
structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions,
text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The
proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA),
keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves
state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively
to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft
prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.

Conclusion: 研究为优化预训练方案提供了更高效的方法，适用于多样化的下游任务。

Abstract: While metrics available during pre-training, such as perplexity, correlate
well with model performance at scaling-laws studies, their predictive
capacities at a fixed model size remain unclear, hindering effective model
selection and development. To address this gap, we formulate the task of
selecting pre-training checkpoints to maximize downstream fine-tuning
performance as a pairwise classification problem: predicting which of two LLMs,
differing in their pre-training, will perform better after supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We construct a dataset using 50 1B parameter LLM variants
with systematically varied pre-training configurations, e.g., objectives or
data, and evaluate them on diverse downstream tasks after SFT. We first conduct
a study and demonstrate that the conventional perplexity is a misleading
indicator. As such, we introduce novel unsupervised and supervised proxy
metrics derived from pre-training that successfully reduce the relative
performance prediction error rate by over 50%. Despite the inherent complexity
of this task, we demonstrate the practical utility of our proposed proxies in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more efficient design of pre-training
schemes optimized for various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Clinical natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly in demand in both
clinical research and operational practice. However, most of the
state-of-the-art solutions are transformers-based and require high
computational resources, limiting their accessibility. We propose a hybrid NLP
framework that integrates rule-based filtering, a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifier, and a BERT-based model to improve efficiency while maintaining
accuracy. We applied this framework in a dementia identification case study
involving 4.9 million veterans with incident hypertension, analyzing 2.1
billion clinical notes. At the patient level, our method achieved a precision
of 0.90, a recall of 0.84, and an F1-score of 0.87. Additionally, this NLP
approach identified over three times as many dementia cases as structured data
methods. All processing was completed in approximately two weeks using a single
machine with dual A40 GPUs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of hybrid
NLP solutions for large-scale clinical text analysis, making state-of-the-art
methods more accessible to healthcare organizations with limited computational
resources.

Abstract: Working with documents is a key part of almost any knowledge work, from
contextualizing research in a literature review to reviewing legal precedent.
Recently, as their capabilities have expanded, primarily text-based NLP systems
have often been billed as able to assist or even automate this kind of work.
But to what extent are these systems able to model these tasks as experts
conceptualize and perform them now? In this study, we interview sixteen domain
experts across two domains to understand their processes of document research,
and compare it to the current state of NLP systems. We find that our
participants processes are idiosyncratic, iterative, and rely extensively on
the social context of a document in addition its content; existing approaches
in NLP and adjacent fields that explicitly center the document as an object,
rather than as merely a container for text, tend to better reflect our
participants' priorities, though they are often less accessible outside their
research communities. We call on the NLP community to more carefully consider
the role of the document in building useful tools that are accessible,
personalizable, iterative, and socially aware.

that such models are widely deployed in applications requiring diverse outputs.
To address this, we introduce a framework for measuring effective semantic
diversity--diversity among outputs that meet quality thresholds--which better
reflects the practical utility of large language models (LLMs). Using
open-ended tasks that require no human intervention, we find counterintuitive
results: although preference-tuned models--especially those trained via
RL--exhibit reduced lexical and syntactic diversity, they produce greater
effective semantic diversity than SFT or base models, not from increasing
diversity among high-quality outputs, but from generating more high-quality
outputs overall. We discover that preference tuning reduces syntactic diversity
while preserving semantic diversity--revealing a distinction between diversity
in form and diversity in content that traditional metrics often overlook. Our
analysis further shows that smaller models are consistently more
parameter-efficient at generating unique content within a fixed sampling
budget, offering insights into the relationship between model scaling and
diversity. These findings have important implications for applications that
require diverse yet high-quality outputs, from creative assistance to synthetic
data generation.

*Aochong Oliver Li,Tanya Goyal*

TLDR: 本文介绍了知识更新游乐场（KUP），一个用于模拟现实知识更新的自动管道，并提出了一种轻量级方法MCT，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对实体替换，无法捕捉复杂现实动态，因此需要更全面的知识更新评估框架和方法。

Method: 提出KUP评估框架和MCT训练方法，通过自生成“记忆”令牌在训练中更新知识。

Result: KUP基准测试极具挑战性，MCT在直接探测（记忆）上比现有方法提升25.4%。

Conclusion: KUP和MCT为LLMs的知识更新提供了更有效的评估和训练方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of pre-trained knowledge in
their parameters, but updating them as real-world information evolves remains a
challenge. Existing methodologies and benchmarks primarily target entity
substitutions, failing to capture the full breadth of complex real-world
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge Update Playground (KUP), an
automatic pipeline for simulating realistic knowledge updates reflected in an
evidence corpora. KUP's evaluation framework includes direct and indirect
probes to both test memorization of updated facts and reasoning over them, for
any update learning methods. Next, we present a lightweight method called
memory conditioned training (MCT), which conditions tokens in the update corpus
on self-generated "memory" tokens during training. Our strategy encourages LLMs
to surface and reason over newly memorized knowledge at inference. Our results
on two strong LLMs show that (1) KUP benchmark is highly challenging, with the
best CPT models achieving $<2\%$ in indirect probing setting (reasoning) and
(2) MCT training significantly outperforms prior continued pre-training (CPT)
baselines, improving direct probing (memorization) results by up to $25.4\%$.

Motivation: 探索LLMs对训练数据的记忆能力及其提取限制，评估当前缓解策略的有效性。

Method: 使用Llama 3 70B模型和“前缀提示”技术，尝试从少量初始标记中重构整本书。

Result: 成功高相似度重构《爱丽丝梦游仙境》，但提取率与书籍流行度相关；指令调优模型的缓解措施失效。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs的记忆提取能力有限且受书籍流行度影响，缓解策略效果不足，需进一步研究调优对记忆提取的影响。

Abstract: To what extent can entire books be extracted from LLMs? Using the Llama 3 70B
family of models, and the "prefix-prompting" extraction technique, we were able
to auto-regressively reconstruct, with a very high level of similarity, one
entire book (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) from just the first 500 tokens.
We were also able to obtain high extraction rates on several other books,
piece-wise. However, these successes do not extend uniformly to all books. We
show that extraction rates of books correlate with book popularity and thus,
likely duplication in the training data.
  We also confirm the undoing of mitigations in the instruction-tuned Llama
3.1, following recent work (Nasr et al., 2025). We further find that this
undoing comes from changes to only a tiny fraction of weights concentrated
primarily in the lower transformer blocks. Our results provide evidence of the
limits of current regurgitation mitigation strategies and introduce a framework
for studying how fine-tuning affects the retrieval of verbatim memorization in
aligned LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for aligning Persian
Large Language Models (LLMs) with critical ethical dimensions, including
safety, fairness, and social norms. It addresses the gaps in existing LLM
evaluation frameworks by adapting them to Persian linguistic and cultural
contexts. This benchmark creates three types of Persian-language benchmarks:
(i) translated data, (ii) new data generated synthetically, and (iii) new
naturally collected data. We translate Anthropic Red Teaming data, AdvBench,
HarmBench, and DecodingTrust into Persian. Furthermore, we create
ProhibiBench-fa, SafeBench-fa, FairBench-fa, and SocialBench-fa as new datasets
to address harmful and prohibited content in indigenous culture. Moreover, we
collect extensive dataset as GuardBench-fa to consider Persian cultural norms.
By combining these datasets, our work establishes a unified framework for
evaluating Persian LLMs, offering a new approach to culturally grounded
alignment evaluation. A systematic evaluation of Persian LLMs is performed
across the three alignment aspects: safety (avoiding harmful content), fairness
(mitigating biases), and social norms (adhering to culturally accepted
behaviors). We present a publicly available leaderboard that benchmarks Persian
LLMs with respect to safety, fairness, and social norms at:

Motivation: 现有RAG框架依赖语义相似性检索，难以区分因果关系与伪关联，导致生成结果可能不完整或误导。

Result: 在四个数据集上验证，CDF-RAG在响应准确性和因果正确性上优于现有RAG方法。

Conclusion: CDF-RAG显著提升了生成结果的因果一致性和事实准确性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced large
language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks by incorporating external
knowledge retrieval. However, existing RAG frameworks primarily rely on
semantic similarity and correlation-driven retrieval, limiting their ability to
distinguish true causal relationships from spurious associations. This results
in responses that may be factually grounded but fail to establish
cause-and-effect mechanisms, leading to incomplete or misleading insights. To
address this issue, we introduce Causal Dynamic Feedback for Adaptive
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CDF-RAG), a framework designed to improve
causal consistency, factual accuracy, and explainability in generative
reasoning. CDF-RAG iteratively refines queries, retrieves structured causal
graphs, and enables multi-hop causal reasoning across interconnected knowledge
sources. Additionally, it validates responses against causal pathways, ensuring
logically coherent and factually grounded outputs. We evaluate CDF-RAG on four
diverse datasets, demonstrating its ability to improve response accuracy and
causal correctness over existing RAG-based methods. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/ elakhatibi/CDF-RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据多样性不足限制了其在特定领域模型适配中的应用，需要一种方法提升数据多样性。

Method: 提出MetaSynth，利用语言模型协调多个专家LLM代理协作生成数据，增强多样性。

Result: 仅用2500万token的MetaSynth数据，Mistral-7B在金融和生物医学领域性能分别提升4.08%和13.75%。

Conclusion: MetaSynth生成的多样化合成数据可有效用于领域适配，无需混合真实数据。

Abstract: Recent smaller language models such Phi-3.5 and Phi-4 rely on synthetic data
generated using larger Language models. Questions remain about leveraging
synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains.
A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts
its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we
propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances
diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple
"expert" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million
tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a
well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and
Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in
general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data
using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM
pre-training corpora.
  Continually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms
the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in
Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data
generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior
generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. Our findings suggest
that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real
data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth.

TLDR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）在某些确定性任务中表现不佳，但通过干预可以改善其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在确定性任务中表现不佳，因其隐式先验分布影响了响应。研究旨在探索如何通过干预让LLM更好地完成任务。

Method: 通过提示和机制解释技术定位先验，并对相关神经网络层进行轻量级微调。

Result: 干预显著提升了任务性能，且微调后错误不再与先验相关。

Conclusion: 研究为操纵LLM依赖先验的方法提供了可能，有助于减少幻觉现象。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) sometimes fail to respond appropriately to
deterministic tasks -- such as counting or forming acronyms -- because the
implicit prior distribution they have learned over sequences of tokens
influences their responses. In this work, we show that, in at least some cases,
LLMs actually compute the information needed to perform these tasks correctly,
and we identify some interventions that can allow them to access this
information to improve their performance. First, we show that simply prompting
the language model to not rely on its prior knowledge leads to dramatic
improvements in prior-dominated tasks. We then use mechanistic interpretability
techniques to localize the prior within the LLM and manipulate the extent to
which that prior influences its responses. Specifically, we show that it is
possible to identify layers of the underlying neural network that correlate
with the prior probability of a response and that lightweight finetuning of
these layers with basic prompts on prior-dominated tasks achieves high
performance on held-out answers. These results suggest that the information
required to produce a correct response is contained within the representations
of the problems formed by the models. Furthermore, we show that this finetuning
is significantly more effective for prior-dominated tasks, and that the error
after finetuning is no longer correlated with the prior. Our results suggest
that it may be possible to define effective methods for manipulating the extent
to which LLMs rely upon their priors in solving problems, potentially
increasing their performance in settings where LLMs hallucinate for reasons
related to the prior probability of token sequences.

Method: 提出GeoSense，包含五级几何原理框架、1789个标注问题和创新评估策略，测试多种MLLMs。

Result: Gemini-2.0-pro-flash表现最佳，总体得分65.3，但几何原理识别和应用仍是瓶颈。

Conclusion: GeoSense有助于指导MLLMs几何推理能力的未来改进，推动更接近人类推理的AI发展。

Abstract: Geometry problem-solving (GPS), a challenging task requiring both visual
comprehension and symbolic reasoning, effectively measures the reasoning
capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Humans exhibit strong
reasoning ability in this task through accurate identification and adaptive
application of geometric principles within visual contexts. However, existing
benchmarks fail to jointly assess both dimensions of the human-like geometric
reasoning mechanism in MLLMs, remaining a critical gap in assessing their
ability to tackle GPS. To this end, we introduce GeoSense, the first
comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the
geometric reasoning abilities of MLLMs through the lens of geometric
principles. GeoSense features a five-level hierarchical framework of geometric
principles spanning plane and solid geometry, an intricately annotated dataset
of 1,789 problems, and an innovative evaluation strategy. Through extensive
experiments on GeoSense with various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we
observe that Gemini-2.0-pro-flash performs best, achieving an overall score of
$65.3$. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the identification and application
of geometric principles remain a bottleneck for leading MLLMs, jointly
hindering their reasoning abilities. These findings underscore GeoSense's
potential to guide future advancements in MLLMs' geometric reasoning
capabilities, paving the way for more robust and human-like reasoning in
artificial intelligence.

Result: 实验表明SOLAR提升了推断结果的准确性，尤其在争议情境中表现更优，并能解释个体的价值偏好。

Conclusion: SOLAR框架有效捕捉个体主观性，为LLMs在主观决策任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) not only have solved complex reasoning problems
but also exhibit remarkable performance in tasks that require subjective
decision making. Existing studies suggest that LLM generations can be
subjectively grounded to some extent, yet exploring whether LLMs can account
for individual-level subjectivity has not been sufficiently studied. In this
paper, we characterize subjectivity of individuals on social media and infer
their moral judgments using LLMs. We propose a framework, SOLAR (Subjective
Ground with Value Abstraction), that observes value conflicts and trade-offs in
the user-generated texts to better represent subjective ground of individuals.
Empirical results show that our framework improves overall inference results as
well as performance on controversial situations. Additionally, we qualitatively
show that SOLAR provides explanations about individuals' value preferences,
which can further account for their judgments.

Method: 采用逐步旋转位置嵌入（RoPE）扩展训练策略，生成合成数据以扩展上下文长度。

Result: 模型在1M tokens的上下文长度下，在RULER和InfiniteBench上表现良好，同时保持通用语言任务的稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长上下文数据稀缺问题，并展示了在超长上下文任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with long-context reasoning, not only
due to the quadratic scaling of computational complexity with sequence length
but also because of the scarcity and expense of annotating long-context data.
There has been barely any open-source work that systematically ablates
long-context data, nor is there any openly available instruction tuning dataset
with contexts surpassing 100K tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
post-training synthetic data generation strategy designed to efficiently extend
the context window of LLMs while preserving their general task performance. Our
approach scalably extends to arbitrarily long context lengths, unconstrained by
the length of available real-world data, which effectively addresses the
scarcity of raw long-context data. Through a step-by-step rotary position
embedding (RoPE) scaling training strategy, we demonstrate that our model, with
a context length of up to 1M tokens, performs well on the RULER benchmark and
InfiniteBench and maintains robust performance on general language tasks.

Conclusion: Persona-judge为自适应定制对齐提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning language models with human preferences presents significant
challenges, particularly in achieving personalization without incurring
excessive computational costs. Existing methods rely on reward signals and
additional annotated data, limiting their scalability and adaptability to
diverse human values. To address these challenges, we introduce Persona-judge,
a novel discriminative paradigm that enables training-free personalized
alignment with unseen preferences. Instead of optimizing policy parameters
through external reward feedback, Persona-judge leverages the intrinsic
preference judgment capabilities of the model. Specifically, a draft model
generates candidate tokens conditioned on a given preference, while a judge
model, embodying another preference, cross-validates the predicted tokens
whether to be accepted. Experimental results demonstrate that Persona-judge,
using the inherent preference evaluation mechanisms of the model, offers a
scalable and computationally efficient solution to personalized alignment,
paving the way for more adaptive customized alignment.

Motivation: 检索到的文档常包含无关或误导信息，导致抽象压缩模型忽略关键内容，影响答案准确性。

Method: 提出ACoRN，包括离线数据增强和微调步骤，以提升模型对噪声的鲁棒性和关键信息提取能力。

Result: 实验显示ACoRN在T5-large模型上提升了EM和F1分数，并保留答案字符串作为直接证据。

Conclusion: ACoRN在噪声文档较多的数据集中表现优异，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Abstractive compression utilizes smaller langauge models to condense
query-relevant context, reducing computational costs in retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). However,retrieved documents often include information that is
either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect
content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that
abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential
for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion
occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more
fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise
(ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data
augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against
two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language modelbased
compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents
and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries
centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer. Our
experiments demonstrate that T5-large, trained with ACoRN as a compressor,
improves EM and F1 scores while preserving the answer string, which could serve
as direct evidence. ACoRN excels on datasets with many accuracy-reducing
documents, making it highly useful in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能学习敏感信息，引发社会和法律问题，现有方法无法有效处理多领域交织的知识遗忘问题。

Method: GRAIL利用多领域梯度信息区分遗忘和保留范围，并采用自适应参数定位策略选择性移除目标知识。

Result: GRAIL在遗忘基准测试中表现与现有方法相当，知识保留成功率比之前最优方法高17%。

Conclusion: GRAIL为大规模预训练语言模型中的敏感信息管理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive datasets often learn
sensitive information, which raises significant social and legal concerns under
principles such as the "Right to be forgotten." Retraining entire models from
scratch to remove undesired information is both costly and impractical.
Furthermore, existing single-domain unlearning methods fail to address
multi-domain scenarios, where knowledge is interwoven across domains such as
privacy and copyright, creating overlapping representations that lead to
excessive knowledge removal or degraded performance. To tackle these issues, we
propose GRAIL (GRadient-based AdaptIve unLearning), a novel multi-domain
unlearning framework. GRAIL leverages gradient information from multiple
domains to precisely distinguish the unlearning scope from the retention scope,
and applies an adaptive parameter-wise localization strategy to selectively
remove targeted knowledge while preserving critical parameters for each domain.
Experimental results on unlearning benchmarks show that GRAIL achieves
unlearning success on par with the existing approaches, while also
demonstrating up to 17% stronger knowledge retention success compared to the
previous state-of-art method. Our findings establish a new paradigm for
effectively managing and regulating sensitive information in large-scale
pre-trained language models.

Conclusion: 优化数据选择和分词过程可同时提升模型性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in code
generation tasks. However, there remains a performance gap between open-source
and closed-source models. To address this gap, existing approaches typically
generate large amounts of synthetic data for fine-tuning, which often leads to
inefficient training. In this work, we propose a data selection strategy in
order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of training for code-based
LLMs. By prioritizing data complexity and ensuring that the sampled subset
aligns with the distribution of the original dataset, our sampling strategy
effectively selects high-quality data. Additionally, we optimize the
tokenization process through a "dynamic pack" technique, which minimizes
padding tokens and reduces computational resource consumption. Experimental
results show that when training on 40% of the OSS-Instruct dataset, the
DeepSeek-Coder-Base-6.7B model achieves an average performance of 66.9%,
surpassing the 66.1% performance with the full dataset. Moreover, training time
is reduced from 47 minutes to 34 minutes, and the peak GPU memory decreases
from 61.47 GB to 42.72 GB during a single epoch. Similar improvements are
observed with the CodeLlama-Python-7B model on the Evol-Instruct dataset. By
optimizing both data selection and tokenization, our approach not only improves
model performance but also improves training efficiency.

Conclusion: 本研究为幻觉现象提供了统一视角和稳健的追踪分析框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations-content that
deviates from factual accuracy or provided context-posing challenges for
diagnosis due to the complex interplay of underlying causes. This paper
introduces a subsequence association framework to systematically trace and
understand hallucinations. Our key insight is that hallucinations arise when
dominant hallucinatory associations outweigh faithful ones. Through theoretical
and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that decoder-only transformers
effectively function as subsequence embedding models, with linear layers
encoding input-output associations. We propose a tracing algorithm that
identifies causal subsequences by analyzing hallucination probabilities across
randomized input contexts. Experiments show our method outperforms standard
attribution techniques in identifying hallucination causes and aligns with
evidence from the model's training corpus. This work provides a unified
perspective on hallucinations and a robust framework for their tracing and
analysis.

Abstract: Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language
questions (NLQs) by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and
knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods either rely on
employing task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which
struggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or
align with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper
proposes a novel USKR framework named \textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage
of \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge
representation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to
generate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question.
Demonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various
SKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora}
outperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with
task-specific methods.

*Fatma Elsafoury,David Hartmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该论文研究了语言模型（LMs）对边缘群体的偏见问题，特别关注了阿拉伯国家、德国、英国和美国等地区的270个边缘群体，并探讨了低资源语言和方言对偏见研究的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对语言模型偏见的研究主要集中在英语世界，忽视了全球其他地区的边缘群体和低资源语言，导致这些群体的不公平待遇未被充分关注。

Method: 研究了23个语言模型对270个边缘群体的偏见，比较了埃及阿拉伯方言与现代标准阿拉伯语对偏见测量的影响。

Result: 发现语言模型对许多边缘群体的偏见高于主流群体，但阿拉伯语模型在宗教和种族方面对所有群体均表现出高偏见。此外，对非二元性别、LGBTQIA+和黑人女性的交叉偏见更高。

Conclusion: 为了开发更具包容性的语言模型，需要扩大研究范围，涵盖更多被忽视的边缘群体和低资源语言。

Abstract: We know that language models (LMs) form biases and stereotypes of minorities,
leading to unfair treatments of members of these groups, thanks to research
mainly in the US and the broader English-speaking world. As the negative
behavior of these models has severe consequences for society and individuals,
industry and academia are actively developing methods to reduce the bias in
LMs. However, there are many under-represented groups and languages that have
been overlooked so far. This includes marginalized groups that are specific to
individual countries and regions in the English speaking and Western world, but
crucially also almost all marginalized groups in the rest of the world. The UN
estimates, that between 600 million to 1.2 billion people worldwide are members
of marginalized groups and in need for special protection. If we want to
develop inclusive LMs that work for everyone, we have to broaden our
understanding to include overlooked marginalized groups and low-resource
languages and dialects.
  In this work, we contribute to this effort with the first study investigating
offensive stereotyping bias in 23 LMs for 270 marginalized groups from Egypt,
the remaining 21 Arab countries, Germany, the UK, and the US. Additionally, we
investigate the impact of low-resource languages and dialects on the study of
bias in LMs, demonstrating the limitations of current bias metrics, as we
measure significantly higher bias when using the Egyptian Arabic dialect versus
Modern Standard Arabic. Our results show, LMs indeed show higher bias against
many marginalized groups in comparison to dominant groups. However, this is not
the case for Arabic LMs, where the bias is high against both marginalized and
dominant groups in relation to religion and ethnicity.
  Our results also show higher intersectional bias against Non-binary, LGBTQIA+
and Black women.

Result: 实验显示方法显著提升MLLMs在几何推理任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs与符号系统的优势，为几何问题求解提供了更可靠且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in general domains and demonstrated promise in multimodal
mathematical reasoning. However, applying MLLMs to geometry problem solving
(GPS) remains challenging due to lack of accurate step-by-step solution data
and severe hallucinations during reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoGen, a
pipeline that can automatically generates step-wise reasoning paths for
geometry diagrams. By leveraging the precise symbolic reasoning,
\textbf{GeoGen} produces large-scale, high-quality question-answer pairs. To
further enhance the logical reasoning ability of MLLMs, we train
\textbf{GeoLogic}, a Large Language Model (LLM) using synthetic data generated
by GeoGen. Serving as a bridge between natural language and symbolic systems,
GeoLogic enables symbolic tools to help verifying MLLM outputs, making the
reasoning process more rigorous and alleviating hallucinations. Experimental
results show that our approach consistently improves the performance of MLLMs,
achieving remarkable results on benchmarks for geometric reasoning tasks. This
improvement stems from our integration of the strengths of LLMs and symbolic
systems, which enables a more reliable and interpretable approach for the GPS
task. Codes are available at https://github.com/ycpNotFound/GeoGen.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在艺术评论和心智理论（ToM）任务中的表现，发现其能生成接近人类水平的评论，并在复杂情境中展现部分推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在艺术评论和心智理论任务中的能力，以评估其是否能在复杂情境中表现出类似人类的理解。

Method: 结合艺术批评理论生成评论，并通过逐步提示优化；设计新的ToM任务测试LLMs在情感和道德情境中的表现。

Result: LLMs生成的评论在风格和解释上接近人类，ToM任务表现因模型和任务复杂度而异。

Conclusion: LLMs在特定指导下能表现出类似理解的行为，但其能力仍受认知限制。

Abstract: This study explored how large language models (LLMs) perform in two areas
related to art: writing critiques of artworks and reasoning about mental states
(Theory of Mind, or ToM) in art-related situations. For the critique generation
part, we built a system that combines Noel Carroll's evaluative framework with
a broad selection of art criticism theories. The model was prompted to first
write a full-length critique and then shorter, more coherent versions using a
step-by-step prompting process. These AI-generated critiques were then compared
with those written by human experts in a Turing test-style evaluation. In many
cases, human subjects had difficulty telling which was which, and the results
suggest that LLMs can produce critiques that are not only plausible in style
but also rich in interpretation, as long as they are carefully guided. In the
second part, we introduced new simple ToM tasks based on situations involving
interpretation, emotion, and moral tension, which can appear in the context of
art. These go beyond standard false-belief tests and allow for more complex,
socially embedded forms of reasoning. We tested 41 recent LLMs and found that
their performance varied across tasks and models. In particular, tasks that
involved affective or ambiguous situations tended to reveal clearer
differences. Taken together, these results help clarify how LLMs respond to
complex interpretative challenges, revealing both their cognitive limitations
and potential. While our findings do not directly contradict the so-called
Generative AI Paradox--the idea that LLMs can produce expert-like output
without genuine understanding--they suggest that, depending on how LLMs are
instructed, such as through carefully designed prompts, these models may begin
to show behaviors that resemble understanding more closely than we might
assume.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注性能优化，缺乏对模型内部机制的理解，且依赖复杂预处理导致系统不透明。

Method: 提出SMARTe，通过槽注意力机制将任务转化为集合预测问题，确保预测可追溯。

Result: 在NYT和WebNLG数据集上验证，SMARTe在保持性能的同时提供可解释性。

Conclusion: SMARTe展示了可解释性与性能的平衡，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Relational Triple Extraction (RTE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). However, prior research has primarily focused on optimizing
model performance, with limited efforts to understand the internal mechanisms
driving these models. Many existing methods rely on complex preprocessing to
induce specific interactions, often resulting in opaque systems that may not
fully align with their theoretical foundations. To address these limitations,
we propose SMARTe: a Slot-based Method for Accountable Relational Triple
extraction. SMARTe introduces intrinsic interpretability through a slot
attention mechanism and frames the task as a set prediction problem. Slot
attention consolidates relevant information into distinct slots, ensuring all
predictions can be explicitly traced to learned slot representations and the
tokens contributing to each predicted relational triple. While emphasizing
interpretability, SMARTe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
models. Evaluations on the NYT and WebNLG datasets demonstrate that adding
interpretability does not compromise performance. Furthermore, we conducted
qualitative assessments to showcase the explanations provided by SMARTe, using
attention heatmaps that map to their respective tokens. We conclude with a
discussion of our findings and propose directions for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: MLRBench是一个新的多语言长上下文推理基准测试，超越了传统的检索中心测试，评估多跳推理、聚合和认知推理能力，并解决了数据泄漏和短路径问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试过于关注检索能力，忽略了推理能力，且易受数据泄漏和短路径问题影响，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 提出MLRBench，一个合成的多语言长上下文推理基准测试，包含多跳推理、聚合和认知推理任务，覆盖七种语言，具有并行性和抗泄漏特性。

Result: 实验发现高低资源语言间存在显著差距，LLMs在多语言环境下仅能利用不到30%的宣称上下文长度，且检索增强生成仅部分缓解问题。

Conclusion: MLRBench为多语言LLMs的评估和训练提供了新工具，揭示了现有模型的局限性，并开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Existing multilingual long-context benchmarks, often based on the popular
needle-in-a-haystack test, primarily evaluate a model's ability to locate
specific information buried within irrelevant texts. However, such a
retrieval-centric approach is myopic and inherently limited, as successful
recall alone does not indicate a model's capacity to reason over extended
contexts. Moreover, these benchmarks are susceptible to data leakage,
short-circuiting, and risk making the evaluation a priori identifiable. To
address these limitations, we introduce MLRBench, a new synthetic benchmark for
multilingual long-context reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks, MLRBench goes
beyond surface-level retrieval by including tasks that assess multi-hop
inference, aggregation, and epistemic reasoning. Spanning seven languages,
MLRBench is designed to be parallel, resistant to leakage, and scalable to
arbitrary context lengths. Our extensive experiments with an open-weight large
language model (LLM) reveal a pronounced gap between high- and low-resource
languages, particularly for tasks requiring the model to aggregate multiple
facts or predict the absence of information. We also find that, in multilingual
settings, LLMs effectively utilize less than 30% of their claimed context
length. Although off-the-shelf Retrieval Augmented Generation helps alleviate
this to a certain extent, it does not solve the long-context problem. We
open-source MLRBench to enable future research in improved evaluation and
training of multilingual LLMs.

TLDR: ViClaim是一个多语言、多主题的视频转录数据集，用于检测视频中的虚假信息，填补了现有研究在口语文本分析上的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频内容作为传播和虚假信息的媒介日益重要，但现有虚假信息检测工具主要针对书面文本，缺乏对视频转录中口语文本复杂性的处理。

Method: 构建ViClaim数据集，包含1,798个标注视频转录，覆盖三种语言和六个主题，并使用定制标注工具进行复杂标注。实验采用多语言语言模型进行验证。

Result: 模型在交叉验证中表现优异（宏F1达0.896），但在未见主题上泛化能力有限，尤其是跨领域时。

Conclusion: ViClaim为视频虚假信息检测提供了坚实基础，突显了视频转录中声明检测的复杂性。

Abstract: The growing influence of video content as a medium for communication and
misinformation underscores the urgent need for effective tools to analyze
claims in multilingual and multi-topic settings. Existing efforts in
misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant
gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We
introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three
languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the
transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy,
fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to
facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with
state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in
cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization
to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the
complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust
foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication,
addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced AI agents
as a disruptive paradigm across various industries, yet their application in
machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. This paper describes and
analyses the potential of single- and multi-agent systems for MT, reflecting on
how they could enhance multilingual digital communication. While single-agent
systems are well-suited for simpler translation tasks, multi-agent systems,
which involve multiple specialized AI agents collaborating in a structured
manner, may offer a promising solution for complex scenarios requiring high
accuracy, domain-specific knowledge, and contextual awareness. To demonstrate
the feasibility of multi-agent workflows in MT, we are conducting a pilot study
in legal MT. The study employs a multi-agent system involving four specialized
AI agents for (i) translation, (ii) adequacy review, (iii) fluency review, and
(iv) final editing. Our findings suggest that multi-agent systems may have the
potential to significantly improve domain-adaptability and contextual
awareness, with superior translation quality to traditional MT or single-agent
systems. This paper also sets the stage for future research into multi-agent
applications in MT, integration into professional translation workflows, and
shares a demo of the system analyzed in the paper.

Result: 实验表明IGCIDB能有效去偏，提升LLM在不同任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: IGCIDF是一种有效的自动去偏方法，能显著提升LLM的泛化性能。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, recent studies indicate that current large
language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them during
inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. However, due to the
diversity of dataset biases and the insufficient nature of bias suppression
based on in-context learning, the effectiveness of previous prior
knowledge-based debiasing methods and in-context learning based automatic
debiasing methods is limited. To address these challenges, we explore the
combination of causal mechanisms with information theory and propose an
information gain-guided causal intervention debiasing (IGCIDB) framework. This
framework first utilizes an information gain-guided causal intervention method
to automatically and autonomously balance the distribution of
instruction-tuning dataset. Subsequently, it employs a standard supervised
fine-tuning process to train LLMs on the debiased dataset. Experimental results
show that IGCIDB can effectively debias LLM to improve its generalizability
across different tasks.

Result: 实验表明NaVAB能有效识别LLMs与目标国家价值观的偏差，并可通过对齐技术减少冲突。

Conclusion: NaVAB为评估和改善LLMs与国家价值观对齐提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) hold positions that conflict with your
country's values? Occasionally they do! However, existing works primarily focus
on ethical reviews, failing to capture the diversity of national values, which
encompass broader policy, legal, and moral considerations. Furthermore, current
benchmarks that rely on spectrum tests using manually designed questionnaires
are not easily scalable.
  To address these limitations, we introduce NaVAB, a comprehensive benchmark
to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with the values of five major nations: China,
the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. NaVAB implements a
national value extraction pipeline to efficiently construct value assessment
datasets. Specifically, we propose a modeling procedure with instruction
tagging to process raw data sources, a screening process to filter
value-related topics and a generation process with a Conflict Reduction
mechanism to filter non-conflicting values.We conduct extensive experiments on
various LLMs across countries, and the results provide insights into assisting
in the identification of misaligned scenarios. Moreover, we demonstrate that
NaVAB can be combined with alignment techniques to effectively reduce value
concerns by aligning LLMs' values with the target country.

Result: 实验证明，基于MAIN框架微调的LLaMA和Mistral模型在多个基准测试中优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 指令-响应的对齐关系对高质量、可扩展的指令调优至关重要，MAIN框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has enabled large language models (LLMs) to achieve
remarkable performance, but its success heavily depends on the availability of
large-scale, high-quality instruction-response pairs. However, current methods
for scaling up data generation often overlook a crucial aspect: the alignment
between instructions and responses. We hypothesize that high-quality
instruction-response pairs are not defined by the individual quality of each
component, but by the extent of their alignment with each other. To address
this, we propose a Mutual Alignment Framework (MAIN) that ensures coherence
between the instruction and response through mutual constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that models such as LLaMA and Mistral, fine-tuned within this
framework, outperform traditional methods across multiple benchmarks. This
approach underscores the critical role of instruction-response alignment in
enabling scalable and high-quality instruction tuning for LLMs.

Conclusion: 研究挑战了复杂推理策略必然更优的假设，表明简单高效的方法也能取得最佳结果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the
development of general-purpose autonomous agents, demonstrating remarkable
performance in complex reasoning tasks across various domains. This surge has
spurred the evolution of a plethora of prompt-based reasoning frameworks. A
recent focus has been on iterative reasoning strategies that refine outputs
through self-evaluation and verbalized feedback. However, these strategies
require additional computational complexity to enable models to recognize and
correct their mistakes, leading to a significant increase in their cost. In
this work, we introduce the concept of ``retrials without feedback'', an
embarrassingly simple yet powerful mechanism for enhancing reasoning frameworks
by allowing LLMs to retry problem-solving attempts upon identifying incorrect
answers. Unlike conventional iterative refinement methods, our method does not
require explicit self-reflection or verbalized feedback, simplifying the
refinement process. Our findings indicate that simpler retrial-based approaches
often outperform more sophisticated reasoning frameworks, suggesting that the
benefits of complex methods may not always justify their computational costs.
By challenging the prevailing assumption that more intricate reasoning
strategies inherently lead to better performance, our work offers new insights
into how simpler, more efficient approaches can achieve optimal results. So,
are retrials all you need?

Conclusion: 该方法对长上下文LM有效，且能推广到新类别LM。

Abstract: Recent advances in long-context reasoning abilities of language models led to
interesting applications in large-scale multi-document summarization. However,
prior work has shown that these long-context models are not effective at their
claimed context windows. To this end, retrieval-augmented systems provide an
efficient and effective alternative. However, their performance can be highly
sensitive to the choice of retrieval context length. In this work, we present a
hybrid method that combines retrieval-augmented systems with long-context
windows supported by recent language models. Our method first estimates the
optimal retrieval length as a function of the retriever, summarizer, and
dataset. On a randomly sampled subset of the dataset, we use a panel of LLMs to
generate a pool of silver references. We use these silver references to
estimate the optimal context length for a given RAG system configuration. Our
results on the multi-document summarization task showcase the effectiveness of
our method across model classes and sizes. We compare against length estimates
from strong long-context benchmarks such as RULER and HELMET. Our analysis also
highlights the effectiveness of our estimation method for very long-context LMs
and its generalization to new classes of LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型在生成新颖且可行的科学假设方面表现不佳，缺乏专门的数据集将科学假设生成任务结构化。

Method: 提出HypoGen数据集，包含5500个结构化问题-假设对，采用Bit-Flip-Spark框架和Chain-of-Reasoning组件，将假设生成任务建模为条件语言生成。

Conclusion: HypoGen数据集为科学假设生成任务提供了有效支持，未来可进一步扩展应用。

Abstract: Generating novel and creative scientific hypotheses is a cornerstone in
achieving Artificial General Intelligence. Large language and reasoning models
have the potential to aid in the systematic creation, selection, and validation
of scientifically informed hypotheses. However, current foundation models often
struggle to produce scientific ideas that are both novel and feasible. One
reason is the lack of a dedicated dataset that frames Scientific Hypothesis
Generation (SHG) as a Natural Language Generation (NLG) task. In this paper, we
introduce HypoGen, the first dataset of approximately 5500 structured
problem-hypothesis pairs extracted from top-tier computer science conferences
structured with a Bit-Flip-Spark schema, where the Bit is the conventional
assumption, the Spark is the key insight or conceptual leap, and the Flip is
the resulting counterproposal. HypoGen uniquely integrates an explicit
Chain-of-Reasoning component that reflects the intellectual process from Bit to
Flip. We demonstrate that framing hypothesis generation as conditional language
modelling, with the model fine-tuned on Bit-Flip-Spark and the
Chain-of-Reasoning (and where, at inference, we only provide the Bit), leads to
improvements in the overall quality of the hypotheses. Our evaluation employs
automated metrics and LLM judge rankings for overall quality assessment. We
show that by fine-tuning on our HypoGen dataset we improve the novelty,
feasibility, and overall quality of the generated hypotheses. The HypoGen
dataset is publicly available at
huggingface.co/datasets/UniverseTBD/hypogen-dr1.

*Jiatai Wang,Zhiwei Xu,Di Jin,Xuewen Yang,Tao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文分析了大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识冲突中的表现，提出了一种名为Swin-VIB的新框架，通过变分信息瓶颈模型优化检索信息，显著提升了任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在信息检索系统中面临内部记忆与外部检索信息之间的知识冲突，导致响应不可靠和决策不确定性。研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Swin-VIB框架，整合变分信息瓶颈模型，自适应增强检索信息并指导LLMs的响应生成。

Result: 实验表明，Swin-VIB在单选择、开放式问答和检索增强生成任务中表现优异，单选择任务准确率提升至少7.54%。

Conclusion: Swin-VIB有效解决了LLMs的知识冲突问题，提升了响应生成的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
information retrieval systems, particularly in response generation (RG).
Unfortunately, LLMs often face knowledge conflicts between internal memory and
retrievaled external information, arising from misinformation, biases, or
outdated knowledge. These conflicts undermine response reliability and
introduce uncertainty in decision-making. In this work, we analyze how LLMs
navigate knowledge conflicts from an information-theoretic perspective and
reveal that when conflicting and supplementary information exhibit significant
differences, LLMs confidently resolve their preferences. However, when the
distinction is ambiguous, LLMs experience heightened uncertainty. Based on this
insight, we propose Swin-VIB, a novel framework that integrates a pipeline of
variational information bottleneck models into adaptive augmentation of
retrieved information and guiding LLM preference in response generation.
Extensive experiments on single-choice, open-ended question-answering (QA), and
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate the efficacy of Swin-VIB. Notably, our method improves
single-choice task accuracy by at least 7.54\% over competitive baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于因果中介分析和分层优化的两阶段方法，用于在大型语言模型（LLMs）中实现精确的遗忘学习，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在训练过程中容易记忆敏感信息，现有遗忘学习方法难以在不影响整体性能的情况下选择性删除特定数据关联。

Method: 结合因果中介分析和分层优化，通过约束优化方法冻结上层并优化下层，同时使用联合损失函数。

Result: 在1B模型赛道中排名第二，保持88%的基线MMLU准确率。

Conclusion: 因果引导的分层优化为LLMs中的高效精确遗忘提供了新范式，显著推进了AI系统中的数据隐私问题解决。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive information during
training, posing risks when deploying publicly accessible models. Current
machine unlearning methods struggle to selectively remove specific data
associations without degrading overall model capabilities. This paper presents
our solution to SemEval-2025 Task 4 on targeted unlearning, which introduces a
two-stage methodology that combines causal mediation analysis with
layer-specific optimization. Through systematic causal tracing experiments on
OLMo architectures (1B and 7B parameters), we identify the critical role of the
first few transformer layers (layers 0-5) in storing subject-attribute
associations within MLP modules. Building on this insight, we develop a
constrained optimization approach that freezes upper layers while applying a
novel joint loss function to lower layers-simultaneously maximizing forget set
loss via output token cross-entropy penalties and minimizing retain set
deviation through adaptive regularization. Our method achieves 2nd place in the
1B model track, demonstrating strong task performance while maintaining 88% of
baseline MMLU accuracy. These results establish causal-informed layer
optimization as a promising paradigm for efficient, precise unlearning in LLMs,
offering a significant step forward in addressing data privacy concerns in AI
systems.

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在病理学中缺乏对完整临床上下文的理解，主要受限于公开数据集的局部信息。开发WSI级模型对提升可扩展性和适用性至关重要。

Method: 研究使用TCGA的10,094对WSI和病理报告构建检索式数据生成管道，并设计了基于AI的评估协议，以全面理解多模态医学信息。

Conclusion: 该模型通过整合多模态数据，有望辅助临床医生全面理解复杂病理形态，提升癌症诊断能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have made significant progress in developing large language
models (LLMs) in the medical domain, which can answer expert-level questions
and demonstrate the potential to assist clinicians in real-world clinical
scenarios. Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various
modalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex
clinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies
have demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer
questions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical
context due to the patch-level data with limited information from public
datasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the
scalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we
introduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as
ChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using
10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive
understanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and
evaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We
demonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using
ChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and
reports. Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context
from various cancer types. We argue that our proposed model has the potential
to assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of
WSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为“Self-Aspect Retrieval Enhanced Summary Generation”的新框架，用于解决基于方面的摘要生成中的提示工程依赖和标记限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摘要方法资源受限且泛化能力有限，而大型语言模型虽无需训练但过度依赖提示工程并面临标记限制和幻觉问题。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该框架不仅性能优越，还能有效缓解标记限制问题。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过检索机制和内容优化，显著提升了基于方面的摘要生成的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Aspect-based summarization aims to generate summaries tailored to specific
aspects, addressing the resource constraints and limited generalizability of
traditional summarization approaches. Recently, large language models have
shown promise in this task without the need for training. However, they rely
excessively on prompt engineering and face token limits and hallucination
challenges, especially with in-context learning. To address these challenges,
in this paper, we propose a novel framework for aspect-based summarization:
Self-Aspect Retrieval Enhanced Summary Generation. Rather than relying solely
on in-context learning, given an aspect, we employ an embedding-driven
retrieval mechanism to identify its relevant text segments. This approach
extracts the pertinent content while avoiding unnecessary details, thereby
mitigating the challenge of token limits. Moreover, our framework optimizes
token usage by deleting unrelated parts of the text and ensuring that the model
generates output strictly based on the given aspect. With extensive experiments
on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our framework not only achieves
superior performance but also effectively mitigates the token limitation
problem.

TLDR: 研究发现深度学习模型的技术准确性与专家一致性之间存在反比关系，大语言模型（LLMs）虽准确性较低但与专家更一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习模型在安全关键NLP应用中准确性与专家一致性的关系。

Method: 评估五种DL模型和四种LLMs，使用Cohen's Kappa、PCA和SHAP技术分析模型与专家的一致性。

Result: 高准确性模型与专家一致性较低，LLMs更依赖上下文和时间线索而非关键词。

Conclusion: 建议将专家一致性作为模型评估的补充指标，LLMs在事故分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between deep learning (DL) model
accuracy and expert agreement in the classification of crash narratives. We
evaluate five DL models -- including BERT variants, the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE), and a zero-shot classifier -- against expert-labeled data and
narrative text. The analysis is further extended to four large language models
(LLMs): GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen, and Claude. Our results reveal a counterintuitive
trend: models with higher technical accuracy often exhibit lower agreement with
domain experts, whereas LLMs demonstrate greater expert alignment despite
relatively lower accuracy scores. To quantify and interpret model-expert
agreement, we employ Cohen's Kappa, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and
SHAP-based explainability techniques. Findings indicate that expert-aligned
models tend to rely more on contextual and temporal language cues, rather than
location-specific keywords. These results underscore that accuracy alone is
insufficient for evaluating models in safety-critical NLP applications. We
advocate for incorporating expert agreement as a complementary metric in model
evaluation frameworks and highlight the promise of LLMs as interpretable,
scalable tools for crash analysis pipelines.

TLDR: 论文提出了RAMDocs数据集和MADAM-RAG方法，用于同时处理用户查询的模糊性、多源冲突信息以及噪声和错误信息，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统通常单独处理模糊查询或噪声信息，而实际场景中这些挑战往往同时存在，因此需要一种综合解决方案。

Method: 提出RAMDocs数据集模拟复杂冲突场景，并设计MADAM-RAG多代理辩论框架，通过多轮辩论整合有效信息并剔除噪声。

Result: 在AmbigDocs和FaithEval任务上，MADAM-RAG分别提升性能11.40%和15.80%，但RAMDocs对现有基线仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: MADAM-RAG初步解决了多源冲突问题，但在证据不平衡时仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly employing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve the factuality of their
responses. However, in practice, these systems often need to handle ambiguous
user queries and potentially conflicting information from multiple sources
while also suppressing inaccurate information from noisy or irrelevant
documents. Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges in
isolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguity or
robustness to noise and misinformation. We instead consider multiple factors
simultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and
Misinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and
realistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including
ambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent
approach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple
rounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to
disambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby
handling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which
requires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over
strong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires
suppressing misinformation -- where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with
Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for
existing RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match
score). While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our
analysis indicates that a substantial gap remains especially when increasing
the level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型难以捕捉复杂的人类偏好并泛化到未见数据，EBRM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: EBRM通过冲突感知数据过滤、标签噪声感知对比训练和混合初始化，显式建模奖励分布，减少噪声标注的影响。

Result: 实验显示EBRM在鲁棒性和泛化性上显著提升，安全关键对齐任务性能提高5.97%，并有效延迟奖励攻击。

Conclusion: EBRM是一种可扩展且高效的方法，能够增强现有奖励模型和对齐流程。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, they often struggle with capturing complex
human preferences and generalizing to unseen data. To address these challenges,
we introduce Energy-Based Reward Model (EBRM), a lightweight post-hoc
refinement framework that enhances RM robustness and generalization. EBRM
models the reward distribution explicitly, capturing uncertainty in human
preferences and mitigating the impact of noisy or misaligned annotations. It
achieves this through conflict-aware data filtering, label-noise-aware
contrastive training, and hybrid initialization. Notably, EBRM enhances RMs
without retraining, making it computationally efficient and adaptable across
different models and tasks. Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate
significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to
a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard
RMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined
rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. These
results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for
existing RMs and alignment pipelines. The code is available at EBRM.

Result: 实验表明，该方法使小型开源语言模型性能超过更大或闭源模型，且后验分布逼近效果更好。

Conclusion: 该方法为用户提供了一种简单、可编程的方式，适用于广泛的受控生成问题。

Abstract: A wide range of LM applications require generating text that conforms to
syntactic or semantic constraints. Imposing such constraints can be naturally
framed as probabilistic conditioning, but exact generation from the resulting
distribution -- which can differ substantially from the LM's base distribution
-- is generally intractable. In this work, we develop an architecture for
controlled LM generation based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our SMC
framework allows us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific
constraints at inference time, and efficiently reallocate computational
resources in light of new information during the course of generation. By
comparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains
-- Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and
molecule synthesis -- we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach
allows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8x larger,
as well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic
perspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better
approximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds on the framework
of Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its language model probabilistic
programming language, giving users a simple, programmable way to apply SMC to a
broad variety of controlled generation problems.

TLDR: CLIMB是一种自动化的预训练数据混合优化框架，通过聚类和迭代搜索提升性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练数据集通常缺乏明确的领域划分，手动标注耗时且难以找到最优数据混合方案。

Method: CLIMB通过语义空间嵌入和聚类，结合代理模型和预测器迭代优化数据混合。

Result: 1B模型在400B tokens训练下性能超越Llama-3.2-1B 2.0%，特定领域优化提升5%。

Conclusion: CLIMB和配套数据集（ClimbLab、ClimbMix）为预训练数据混合提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-training datasets are typically collected from web content and lack
inherent domain divisions. For instance, widely used datasets like Common Crawl
do not include explicit domain labels, while manually curating labeled datasets
such as The Pile is labor-intensive. Consequently, identifying an optimal
pre-training data mixture remains a challenging problem, despite its
significant benefits for pre-training performance. To address these challenges,
we propose CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping (CLIMB), an
automated framework that discovers, evaluates, and refines data mixtures in a
pre-training setting. Specifically, CLIMB embeds and clusters large-scale
datasets in a semantic space and then iteratively searches for optimal mixtures
using a smaller proxy model and a predictor. When continuously trained on 400B
tokens with this mixture, our 1B model exceeds the state-of-the-art
Llama-3.2-1B by 2.0%. Moreover, we observe that optimizing for a specific
domain (e.g., Social Sciences) yields a 5% improvement over random sampling.
Finally, we introduce ClimbLab, a filtered 1.2-trillion-token corpus with 20
clusters as a research playground, and ClimbMix, a compact yet powerful
400-billion-token dataset designed for efficient pre-training that delivers
superior performance under an equal token budget. We analyze the final data
mixture, elucidating the characteristics of an optimal data mixture. Our data

Conclusion: DMM为多模型合并提供了新思路，解决了风格兼容性问题，提升了生成效率。

Abstract: The success of text-to-image (T2I) generation models has spurred a
proliferation of numerous model checkpoints fine-tuned from the same base model
on various specialized datasets. This overwhelming specialized model production
introduces new challenges for high parameter redundancy and huge storage cost,
thereby necessitating the development of effective methods to consolidate and
unify the capabilities of diverse powerful models into a single one. A common
practice in model merging adopts static linear interpolation in the parameter
space to achieve the goal of style mixing. However, it neglects the features of
T2I generation task that numerous distinct models cover sundry styles which may
lead to incompatibility and confusion in the merged model. To address this
issue, we introduce a style-promptable image generation pipeline which can
accurately generate arbitrary-style images under the control of style vectors.
Based on this design, we propose the score distillation based model merging
paradigm (DMM), compressing multiple models into a single versatile T2I model.
Moreover, we rethink and reformulate the model merging task in the context of
T2I generation, by presenting new merging goals and evaluation protocols. Our
experiments demonstrate that DMM can compactly reorganize the knowledge from
multiple teacher models and achieve controllable arbitrary-style generation.

Result: 实验表明，整合地理空间信息显著提升了分类性能，尤其是在联合利用多尺度信息时效果最佳。

Conclusion: BRIDGE-LC通过有效利用地理空间元数据，为大规模土地覆盖制图提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Land use and land cover mapping from Earth Observation (EO) data is a
critical tool for sustainable land and resource management. While advanced
machine learning and deep learning algorithms excel at analyzing EO imagery
data, they often overlook crucial geospatial metadata information that could
enhance scalability and accuracy across regional, continental, and global
scales. To address this limitation, we propose BRIDGE-LC (Bi-level
Representation Integration for Disentangled GEospatial Land Cover), a novel
deep learning framework that integrates multi-scale geospatial information into
the land cover classification process. By simultaneously leveraging
fine-grained (latitude/longitude) and coarse-grained (biogeographical region)
spatial information, our lightweight multi-layer perceptron architecture learns
from both during training but only requires fine-grained information for
inference, allowing it to disentangle region-specific from region-agnostic land
cover features while maintaining computational efficiency. To assess the
quality of our framework, we use an open-access in-situ dataset and adopt
several competing classification approaches commonly considered for large-scale
land cover mapping. We evaluated all approaches through two scenarios: an
extrapolation scenario in which training data encompasses samples from all
biogeographical regions, and a leave-one-region-out scenario where one region
is excluded from training. We also explore the spatial representation learned
by our model, highlighting a connection between its internal manifold and the
geographical information used during training. Our results demonstrate that
integrating geospatial information improves land cover mapping performance,
with the most substantial gains achieved by jointly leveraging both fine- and
coarse-grained spatial information.

Result: 能够准确重建先前观察到的场景，并在虚拟和现实场景中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: WorldMem不仅能建模静态世界，还能捕捉动态演化，支持模拟世界中的感知和交互。

Abstract: World simulation has gained increasing popularity due to its ability to model
virtual environments and predict the consequences of actions. However, the
limited temporal context window often leads to failures in maintaining
long-term consistency, particularly in preserving 3D spatial consistency. In
this work, we present WorldMem, a framework that enhances scene generation with
a memory bank consisting of memory units that store memory frames and states
(e.g., poses and timestamps). By employing a memory attention mechanism that
effectively extracts relevant information from these memory frames based on
their states, our method is capable of accurately reconstructing previously
observed scenes, even under significant viewpoint or temporal gaps.
Furthermore, by incorporating timestamps into the states, our framework not
only models a static world but also captures its dynamic evolution over time,
enabling both perception and interaction within the simulated world. Extensive
experiments in both virtual and real scenarios validate the effectiveness of
our approach.

Abstract: Current learning-based subject customization approaches, predominantly
relying on U-Net architectures, suffer from limited generalization ability and
compromised image quality. Meanwhile, optimization-based methods require
subject-specific fine-tuning, which inevitably degrades textual
controllability. To address these challenges, we propose InstantCharacter, a
scalable framework for character customization built upon a foundation
diffusion transformer. InstantCharacter demonstrates three fundamental
advantages: first, it achieves open-domain personalization across diverse
character appearances, poses, and styles while maintaining high-fidelity
results. Second, the framework introduces a scalable adapter with stacked
transformer encoders, which effectively processes open-domain character
features and seamlessly interacts with the latent space of modern diffusion
transformers. Third, to effectively train the framework, we construct a
large-scale character dataset containing 10-million-level samples. The dataset
is systematically organized into paired (multi-view character) and unpaired
(text-image combinations) subsets. This dual-data structure enables
simultaneous optimization of identity consistency and textual editability
through distinct learning pathways. Qualitative experiments demonstrate the
advanced capabilities of InstantCharacter in generating high-fidelity,
text-controllable, and character-consistent images, setting a new benchmark for
character-driven image generation. Our source code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLM）在小样本新领域适应中存在严重过拟合和计算限制，现有方法（如低秩重参数化）泛化能力不足且需大量调参。

Method: SO框架采用局部稀疏性和全局密度，动态更新少量参数；结合局部随机性和全局重要性，稀疏化梯度并基于重要性剪枝。

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验表明，SO在小样本适应中表现最优，同时降低了内存开销。

Conclusion: SO框架有效解决了小样本适应中的过拟合问题，提升了模型的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to new domains with few labeled
samples remains a significant challenge due to severe overfitting and
computational constraints. State-of-the-art solutions, such as low-rank
reparameterization, mitigate these issues but often struggle with
generalization and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, a
novel Sparse Optimization (SO) framework is proposed. Unlike low-rank
approaches that typically constrain updates to a fixed subspace, our SO method
leverages high sparsity to dynamically adjust very few parameters. We introduce
two key paradigms. First, we advocate for \textit{local sparsity and global
density}, which updates a minimal subset of parameters per iteration while
maintaining overall model expressiveness. As a second paradigm, we advocate for
\textit{local randomness and global importance}, which sparsifies the gradient
using random selection while pruning the first moment based on importance. This
combination significantly mitigates overfitting and ensures stable adaptation
in low-data regimes. Extensive experiments on 11 diverse datasets show that SO
achieves state-of-the-art few-shot adaptation performance while reducing memory
overhead.

Motivation: 现有零样本3D点云分割方法在从可见类到未见类的迁移以及语义空间到视觉空间的对齐上表现不佳。

Method: 提出3D-PointZshotS框架，利用LGPs通过交叉注意力机制丰富语义特征，并引入自一致性损失增强特征鲁棒性，同时在共享空间中重新表示特征以减少语义-视觉鸿沟。

Result: 在ScanNet、SemanticKITTI和S3DIS数据集上，该方法在谐波mIoU指标上优于四个基线模型。

Conclusion: 3D-PointZshotS通过几何感知和特征对齐显著提升了零样本点云分割的性能。

Abstract: Existing zero-shot 3D point cloud segmentation methods often struggle with
limited transferability from seen classes to unseen classes and from semantic
to visual space. To alleviate this, we introduce 3D-PointZshotS, a
geometry-aware zero-shot segmentation framework that enhances both feature
generation and alignment using latent geometric prototypes (LGPs).
Specifically, we integrate LGPs into a generator via a cross-attention
mechanism, enriching semantic features with fine-grained geometric details. To
further enhance stability and generalization, we introduce a self-consistency
loss, which enforces feature robustness against point-wise perturbations.
Additionally, we re-represent visual and semantic features in a shared space,
bridging the semantic-visual gap and facilitating knowledge transfer to unseen
classes. Experiments on three real-world datasets, namely ScanNet,
SemanticKITTI, and S3DIS, demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance over four baselines in terms of harmonic mIoU. The code is

Motivation: 现有3D点云分类依赖大规模标注数据，而LiDAR数据与CAD模型数据存在领域差异，导致泛化能力不足。点基方法因最大池化操作浪费了大量点特征，加剧了这一问题。

Method: 采用多视角2D投影缓解点云缺失问题，并设计了一个简单有效的卷积模型提取特征。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多视角投影和卷积模型显著提升了3D点云领域泛化能力，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved significant success in 3D point cloud
classification while relying on large-scale, annotated point cloud datasets,
which are labor-intensive to build. Compared to capturing data with LiDAR
sensors and then performing annotation, it is relatively easier to sample point
clouds from CAD models. Yet, data sampled from CAD models is regular, and does
not suffer from occlusion and missing points, which are very common for LiDAR
data, creating a large domain shift. Therefore, it is critical to develop
methods that can generalize well across different point cloud domains. %In this
paper, we focus on the 3D point cloud domain generalization problem. Existing
3D domain generalization methods employ point-based backbones to extract point
cloud features. Yet, by analyzing point utilization of point-based methods and
observing the geometry of point clouds from different domains, we have found
that a large number of point features are discarded by point-based methods
through the max-pooling operation. This is a significant waste especially
considering the fact that domain generalization is more challenging than
supervised learning, and point clouds are already affected by missing points
and occlusion to begin with. To address these issues, we propose a novel method
for 3D point cloud domain generalization, which can generalize to unseen
domains of point clouds. Our proposed method employs multiple 2D projections of
a 3D point cloud to alleviate the issue of missing points and involves a simple
yet effective convolution-based model to extract features. The experiments,
performed on the PointDA-10 and Sim-to-Real benchmarks, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method, which outperforms different baselines,
and can transfer well from synthetic domain to real-world domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编码器在计算资源受限的边缘设备上部署困难，且通常只能处理短视频片段。

Method: AdaVid采用自适应Transformer块，动态调整隐藏嵌入维度，并引入轻量级分层网络处理长视频。

Result: AdaVid在短视频基准测试中性能与标准EgoVLP相当，计算资源减半；在长视频基准测试中实现计算效率与准确性的平衡。

Conclusion: AdaVid为视频编码器提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案，适用于不同计算资源和视频长度的场景。

Abstract: Contrastive video-language pretraining has demonstrated great success in
learning rich and robust video representations. However, deploying such video
encoders on compute-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to their
high computational demands. Additionally, existing models are typically trained
to process only short video clips, often limited to 4 to 64 frames. In this
paper, we introduce AdaVid, a flexible architectural framework designed to
learn efficient video encoders that can dynamically adapt their computational
footprint based on available resources. At the heart of AdaVid is an adaptive
transformer block, inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, which allows
the model to adjust its hidden embedding dimension at inference time. We show
that AdaVid-EgoVLP, trained on video-narration pairs from the large-scale Ego4D
dataset, matches the performance of the standard EgoVLP on short video-language
benchmarks using only half the compute, and even outperforms EgoVLP when given
equal computational resources. We further explore the trade-off between frame
count and compute on the challenging Diving48 classification benchmark, showing
that AdaVid enables the use of more frames without exceeding computational
limits. To handle longer videos, we also propose a lightweight hierarchical
network that aggregates short clip features, achieving a strong balance between
compute efficiency and accuracy across several long video benchmarks.

<details>

Motivation: 事件相机在深度学习驱动的计算机视觉中应用受限，主要原因是高质量标记数据稀缺，而现有模拟数据难以准确模拟真实事件相机数据。

Method: 利用RVT架构的激活特征，提出事件质量评分（EQS），通过模拟与真实数据对比实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，EQS评分越高，模型在模拟数据训练后对真实数据的泛化能力越强。

Conclusion: EQS可作为优化事件相机模拟器的工具，有效减少模拟与现实的差距。

Abstract: Event cameras promise a paradigm shift in vision sensing with their low
latency, high dynamic range, and asynchronous nature of events. Unfortunately,
the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets hinders their widespread adoption
in deep learning-driven computer vision. To mitigate this, several simulators
have been proposed to generate synthetic event data for training models for
detection and estimation tasks. However, the fundamentally different sensor
design of event cameras compared to traditional frame-based cameras poses a
challenge for accurate simulation. As a result, most simulated data fail to
mimic data captured by real event cameras. Inspired by existing work on using
deep features for image comparison, we introduce event quality score (EQS), a
quality metric that utilizes activations of the RVT architecture. Through
sim-to-real experiments on the DSEC driving dataset, it is shown that a higher
EQS implies improved generalization to real-world data after training on
simulated events. Thus, optimizing for EQS can lead to developing more
realistic event camera simulators, effectively reducing the simulation gap. EQS
is available at https://github.com/eventbasedvision/EQS.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging of the heart (echocardiography) is widely used to diagnose
cardiac diseases. However, obtaining an echocardiogram requires an expert
sonographer and a high-quality ultrasound imaging device, which are generally
only available in hospitals. Recently, AI-based navigation models and
algorithms have been used to aid novice sonographers in acquiring the
standardized cardiac views necessary to visualize potential disease
pathologies. These navigation systems typically rely on directional guidance to
predict the necessary rotation of the ultrasound probe. This paper demonstrates
a novel AI navigation system that builds on a decision model for identifying
the inferior vena cava (IVC) of the heart. The decision model is trained
offline using cardiac ultrasound videos and employs binary classification to
determine whether the IVC is present in a given ultrasound video. The
underlying model integrates a novel localization algorithm that leverages the
learned feature representations to annotate the spatial location of the IVC in
real-time. Our model demonstrates strong localization performance on
traditional high-quality hospital ultrasound videos, as well as impressive
zero-shot performance on lower-quality ultrasound videos from a more affordable
Butterfly iQ handheld ultrasound machine. This capability facilitates the
expansion of ultrasound diagnostics beyond hospital settings. Currently, the
guidance system is undergoing clinical trials and is available on the Butterfly
iQ app.

Result: 模型在未参与训练的飓风Ida数据上Dice得分为0.70，且在无碎片区域几乎没有误报。

Conclusion: 该研究首次提出了仅需标准RGB图像的通用碎片分割模型，适用于大规模灾害后评估和恢复规划。

Abstract: Timely and accurate detection of hurricane debris is critical for effective
disaster response and community resilience. While post-disaster aerial imagery
is readily available, robust debris segmentation solutions applicable across
multiple disaster regions remain limited. Developing a generalized solution is
challenging due to varying environmental and imaging conditions that alter
debris' visual signatures across different regions, further compounded by the
scarcity of training data. This study addresses these challenges by fine-tuning
pre-trained foundational vision models, achieving robust performance with a
relatively small, high-quality dataset. Specifically, this work introduces an
open-source dataset comprising approximately 1,200 manually annotated aerial
RGB images from Hurricanes Ian, Ida, and Ike. To mitigate human biases and
enhance data quality, labels from multiple annotators are strategically
aggregated and visual prompt engineering is employed. The resulting fine-tuned
model, named fCLIPSeg, achieves a Dice score of 0.70 on data from Hurricane Ida
-- a disaster event entirely excluded during training -- with virtually no
false positives in debris-free areas. This work presents the first
event-agnostic debris segmentation model requiring only standard RGB imagery
during deployment, making it well-suited for rapid, large-scale post-disaster
impact assessments and recovery planning.

Motivation: 手术室环境复杂，优化工作流程对降低成本和提高患者结果至关重要，但隐私问题限制了计算机视觉的应用，需要隐私保护方法。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：首先生成去标识化的OR数字孪生（DT），然后使用SafeOR模型（融合双流方法）进行事件检测。

Result: 在38个模拟手术试验中，DT方法的事件检测性能与原始RGB视频相当甚至更好。

Conclusion: 数字孪生支持隐私保护的OR工作流分析，促进跨机构共享数据，并可能通过减少领域特定外观差异提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Purpose: The operating room (OR) is a complex environment where optimizing
workflows is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. The use of
computer vision approaches for the automatic recognition of perioperative
events enables identification of bottlenecks for OR optimization. However,
privacy concerns limit the use of computer vision for automated event detection
from OR videos, which makes privacy-preserving approaches needed for OR
workflow analysis. Methods: We propose a two-stage pipeline for
privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. In the first stage,
we leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic
segmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from
conventional RGB videos. In the second stage, we employ the SafeOR model, a
fused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for
OR event detection. We evaluate this method on an internal dataset of 38
simulated surgical trials with five event classes. Results: Our results
indicate that this DT-based approach to the OR event detection model achieves
performance on par and sometimes even better than raw RGB video-based models on
detecting OR events. Conclusion: DTs enable privacy-preserving OR workflow
analysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions
and they can potentially enhance model generalizability by mitigating
domain-specific appearance differences.

Conclusion: 通过变分椭圆先验的集成，显著提升了SAM的分割精度，尤其在需要椭圆形状的任务中表现突出。

Abstract: The elliptical shape prior information plays a vital role in improving the
accuracy of image segmentation for specific tasks in medical and natural
images. Existing deep learning-based segmentation methods, including the
Segment Anything Model (SAM), often struggle to produce segmentation results
with elliptical shapes efficiently. This paper proposes a new approach to
integrate the prior of elliptical shapes into the deep learning-based SAM image
segmentation techniques using variational methods. The proposed method
establishes a parameterized elliptical contour field, which constrains the
segmentation results to align with predefined elliptical contours. Utilizing
the dual algorithm, the model seamlessly integrates image features with
elliptical priors and spatial regularization priors, thereby greatly enhancing
segmentation accuracy. By decomposing SAM into four mathematical sub-problems,
we integrate the variational ellipse prior to design a new SAM network
structure, ensuring that the segmentation output of SAM consists of elliptical
regions. Experimental results on some specific image datasets demonstrate an
improvement over the original SAM.

Abstract: Labeling has always been expensive in the medical context, which has hindered
related deep learning application. Our work introduces active learning in
surgical video frame selection to construct a high-quality, affordable
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy dataset for semantic segmentation. Active learning
allows the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) learning pipeline to include the dataset
construction workflow, which means DNNs trained by existing dataset will
identify the most informative data from the newly collected data. At the same
time, DNNs' performance and generalization ability improve over time when the
newly selected and annotated data are included in the training data. We
assessed different data informativeness measurements and found the deep
features distances select the most informative data in this task. Our
experiments show that with half of the data selected by active learning, the
DNNs achieve almost the same performance with 0.4349 mean Intersection over

mIoU) on the critical anatomies and surgical instruments.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of diffusion models in image generation has increased
the demand for privacy-compliant unlearning. However, due to the
high-dimensional nature and complex feature representations of diffusion
models, achieving selective unlearning remains challenging, as existing methods
struggle to remove sensitive information while preserving the consistency of
non-sensitive regions. To address this, we propose an Automatic Dataset
Creation Framework based on prompt-based layered editing and training-free
local feature removal, constructing the ForgetMe dataset and introducing the
Entangled evaluation metric. The Entangled metric quantifies unlearning
effectiveness by assessing the similarity and consistency between the target
and background regions and supports both paired (Entangled-D) and unpaired
(Entangled-S) image data, enabling unsupervised evaluation. The ForgetMe
dataset encompasses a diverse set of real and synthetic scenarios, including
CUB-200-2011 (Birds), Stanford-Dogs, ImageNet, and a synthetic cat dataset. We
apply LoRA fine-tuning on Stable Diffusion to achieve selective unlearning on
this dataset and validate the effectiveness of both the ForgetMe dataset and
the Entangled metric, establishing them as benchmarks for selective unlearning.
Our work provides a scalable and adaptable solution for advancing
privacy-preserving generative AI.

Conclusion: CM3AE为事件和RGB-Event融合任务提供了强大支持，代码和预训练模型将开源。

Abstract: Event cameras have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to
their advantages in high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, low power
consumption, and low latency. Some researchers have begun exploring
pre-training directly on event data. Nevertheless, these efforts often fail to
establish strong connections with RGB frames, limiting their applicability in
multi-modal fusion scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel CM3AE
pre-training framework for the RGB-Event perception. This framework accepts
multi-modalities/views of data as input, including RGB images, event images,
and event voxels, providing robust support for both event-based and RGB-event
fusion based downstream tasks. Specifically, we design a multi-modal fusion
reconstruction module that reconstructs the original image from fused
multi-modal features, explicitly enhancing the model's ability to aggregate
cross-modal complementary information. Additionally, we employ a multi-modal
contrastive learning strategy to align cross-modal feature representations in a
shared latent space, which effectively enhances the model's capability for
multi-modal understanding and capturing global dependencies. We construct a
large-scale dataset containing 2,535,759 RGB-Event data pairs for the
pre-training. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks fully demonstrated
the effectiveness of CM3AE. Source code and pre-trained models will be released

Abstract: 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (3D-RES) typically requires extensive
instance-level annotations, which are time-consuming and costly.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) mitigates this by using limited labeled data
alongside abundant unlabeled data, improving performance while reducing
annotation costs. SSL uses a teacher-student paradigm where teacher generates
high-confidence-filtered pseudo-labels to guide student. However, in the
context of 3D-RES, where each label corresponds to a single mask and labeled
data is scarce, existing SSL methods treat high-quality pseudo-labels merely as
auxiliary supervision, which limits the model's learning potential. The
reliance on high-confidence thresholds for filtering often results in
potentially valuable pseudo-labels being discarded, restricting the model's
ability to leverage the abundant unlabeled data. Therefore, we identify two
critical challenges in semi-supervised 3D-RES, namely, inefficient utilization
of high-quality pseudo-labels and wastage of useful information from
low-quality pseudo-labels. In this paper, we introduce the first
semi-supervised learning framework for 3D-RES, presenting a robust baseline
method named 3DResT. To address these challenges, we propose two novel designs
called Teacher-Student Consistency-Based Sampling (TSCS) and Quality-Driven
Dynamic Weighting (QDW). TSCS aids in the selection of high-quality
pseudo-labels, integrating them into the labeled dataset to strengthen the
labeled supervision signals. QDW preserves low-quality pseudo-labels by
dynamically assigning them lower weights, allowing for the effective extraction
of useful information rather than discarding them. Extensive experiments
conducted on the widely used benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method. Notably, with only 1% labeled data, 3DResT achieves an mIoU improvement
of 8.34 points compared to the fully supervised method.

TLDR: AdaQual-Diff是一种基于扩散的框架，通过直接集成感知质量评估到生成修复过程中，解决了传统方法在复杂退化图像修复中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖间接线索，难以适应复杂退化图像的独特混合和严重程度，导致修复效果不佳。

Method: 通过自适应质量提示机制，根据区域质量分数动态调整提示结构，优化计算资源分配，实现精确的区域修复。

Result: 实验表明，AdaQual-Diff在合成和真实数据集上均实现了视觉上更优的修复效果。

Conclusion: AdaQual-Diff通过质量引导的方法，实现了对区域修复强度的精细控制，无需额外参数或推理迭代。

Abstract: Restoring images afflicted by complex real-world degradations remains
challenging, as conventional methods often fail to adapt to the unique mixture
and severity of artifacts present. This stems from a reliance on indirect cues
which poorly capture the true perceptual quality deficit. To address this
fundamental limitation, we introduce AdaQual-Diff, a diffusion-based framework
that integrates perceptual quality assessment directly into the generative
restoration process. Our approach establishes a mathematical relationship
between regional quality scores from DeQAScore and optimal guidance complexity,
implemented through an Adaptive Quality Prompting mechanism. This mechanism
systematically modulates prompt structure according to measured degradation
severity: regions with lower perceptual quality receive computationally
intensive, structurally complex prompts with precise restoration directives,
while higher quality regions receive minimal prompts focused on preservation
rather than intervention. The technical core of our method lies in the dynamic
allocation of computational resources proportional to degradation severity,
creating a spatially-varying guidance field that directs the diffusion process
with mathematical precision. By combining this quality-guided approach with
content-specific conditioning, our framework achieves fine-grained control over
regional restoration intensity without requiring additional parameters or
inference iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaQual-Diff
achieves visually superior restorations across diverse synthetic and real-world
datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景图生成方法在受损图像上性能下降，因视觉特征受干扰或遮挡。布局信息是域不变的，可用于增强鲁棒性。

Method: 利用实例归一化过滤域特定特征，通过布局导向恢复恢复结构特征，并设计布局嵌入编码器增强对象和谓词特征。

Conclusion: Robo-SGG作为即插即用模块，显著提升场景图生成在受损图像上的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method named Robo-SGG, i.e.,
Layout-Oriented Normalization and Restitution for Robust Scene Graph
Generation. Compared to the existing SGG setting, the robust scene graph
generation aims to perform inference on a diverse range of corrupted images,
with the core challenge being the domain shift between the clean and corrupted
images. Existing SGG methods suffer from degraded performance due to
compromised visual features e.g., corruption interference or occlusions. To
obtain robust visual features, we exploit the layout information, which is
domain-invariant, to enhance the efficacy of existing SGG methods on corrupted
images. Specifically, we employ Instance Normalization(IN) to filter out the
domain-specific feature and recover the unchangeable structural features, i.e.,
the positional and semantic relationships among objects by the proposed
Layout-Oriented Restitution. Additionally, we propose a Layout-Embedded Encoder
(LEE) that augments the existing object and predicate encoders within the SGG
framework, enriching the robust positional and semantic features of objects and
predicates. Note that our proposed Robo-SGG module is designed as a
plug-and-play component, which can be easily integrated into any baseline SGG
model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating the
state-of-the-art method into our proposed Robo-SGG, we achieve relative
improvements of 5.6%, 8.0%, and 6.5% in mR@50 for PredCls, SGCls, and SGDet
tasks on the VG-C dataset, respectively, and achieve new state-of-the-art
performance in corruption scene graph generation benchmark (VG-C and GQA-C). We
will release our source code and model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑物变化检测在城市化、灾害评估等领域至关重要，但现有方法如SAM因领域差距和分布不平衡问题表现不佳，且时序对齐易受噪声干扰。

Method: FAEWNet结合SAM编码器提取特征，引入分布感知傅里叶适配器聚合任务信息，并设计流模块优化边缘提取和高度偏移估计。

Result: 在LEVIR-CD、S2Looking和WHU-CD数据集上取得最优结果，验证了FAEWNet的有效性。

Conclusion: FAEWNet通过创新适配器和流模块显著提升了建筑物变化检测的精度和边缘识别能力。

Abstract: Building change detection remains challenging for urban development, disaster
assessment, and military reconnaissance. While foundation models like Segment
Anything Model (SAM) show strong segmentation capabilities, SAM is limited in
the task of building change detection due to domain gap issues. Existing
adapter-based fine-tuning approaches face challenges with imbalanced building
distribution, resulting in poor detection of subtle changes and inaccurate edge
extraction. Additionally, bi-temporal misalignment in change detection,
typically addressed by optical flow, remains vulnerable to background noises.
This affects the detection of building changes and compromises both detection
accuracy and edge recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new
SAM-Based Network with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and
Edge-Constrained Warping (FAEWNet) for building change detection. FAEWNet
utilizes the SAM encoder to extract rich visual features from remote sensing
images. To guide SAM in focusing on specific ground objects in remote sensing
scenes, we propose a Distribution-Aware Fourier Aggregated Adapter to aggregate
task-oriented changed information. This adapter not only effectively addresses
the domain gap issue, but also pays attention to the distribution of changed
buildings. Furthermore, to mitigate noise interference and misalignment in
height offset estimation, we design a novel flow module that refines building
edge extraction and enhances the perception of changed buildings. Our
state-of-the-art results on the LEVIR-CD, S2Looking and WHU-CD datasets
highlight the effectiveness of FAEWNet. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中因视频长度导致的上下文长度不固定问题，同时提升训练效率和视觉质量。

Method: 提出FramePack压缩输入帧，固定上下文长度；采用反漂移采样方法，按逆时序生成帧以避免误差累积。

Result: 能够高效处理大量帧，训练批次大小接近图像扩散；现有视频扩散模型可通过FramePack微调提升视觉质量。

Conclusion: FramePack为视频生成提供了一种高效且质量更高的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a neural network structure, FramePack, to train next-frame (or
next-frame-section) prediction models for video generation. The FramePack
compresses input frames to make the transformer context length a fixed number
regardless of the video length. As a result, we are able to process a large
number of frames using video diffusion with computation bottleneck similar to
image diffusion. This also makes the training video batch sizes significantly
higher (batch sizes become comparable to image diffusion training). We also
propose an anti-drifting sampling method that generates frames in inverted
temporal order with early-established endpoints to avoid exposure bias (error
accumulation over iterations). Finally, we show that existing video diffusion
models can be finetuned with FramePack, and their visual quality may be
improved because the next-frame prediction supports more balanced diffusion
schedulers with less extreme flow shift timesteps.

Conclusion: TTOG通过统一规划和运动任务，结合状态估计和场景表示优化，实现了最先进的自动驾驶性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has made impressive progress in recent years.
Former end-to-end autonomous driving approaches often decouple planning and
motion tasks, treating them as separate modules. This separation overlooks the
potential benefits that planning can gain from learning out-of-distribution
data encountered in motion tasks. However, unifying these tasks poses
significant challenges, such as constructing shared contextual representations
and handling the unobservability of other vehicles' states. To address these
challenges, we propose TTOG, a novel two-stage trajectory generation framework.
In the first stage, a diverse set of trajectory candidates is generated, while
the second stage focuses on refining these candidates through vehicle state
information. To mitigate the issue of unavailable surrounding vehicle states,
TTOG employs a self-vehicle data-trained state estimator, subsequently extended
to other vehicles. Furthermore, we introduce ECSA (equivariant context-sharing
scene adapter) to enhance the generalization of scene representations across
different agents. Experimental results demonstrate that TTOG achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both planning and motion tasks. Notably, on
the challenging open-loop nuScenes dataset, TTOG reduces the L2 distance by
36.06\%. Furthermore, on the closed-loop Bench2Drive dataset, our approach
achieves a 22\% improvement in the driving score (DS), significantly
outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Arabidopsis is a widely used model plant to gain basic knowledge on plant
physiology and development. Live imaging is an important technique to visualize
and quantify elemental processes in plant development. To uncover novel
theories underlying plant growth and cell division, accurate cell tracking on
live imaging is of utmost importance. The commonly used cell tracking software,
TrackMate, adopts tracking-by-detection fashion, which applies Laplacian of
Gaussian (LoG) for blob detection, and Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) tracker
for tracking. However, they do not perform sufficiently when cells are densely
arranged. To alleviate the problems mentioned above, we propose an accurate
tracking method based on Genetic algorithm (GA) using knowledge of Arabidopsis
root cellular patterns and spatial relationship among volumes. Our method can
be described as a coarse-to-fine method, in which we first conducted relatively
easy line-level tracking of cell nuclei, then performed complicated nuclear
tracking based on known linear arrangement of cell files and their spatial
relationship between nuclei. Our method has been evaluated on a long-time live
imaging dataset of Arabidopsis root tips, and with minor manual rectification,
it accurately tracks nuclei. To the best of our knowledge, this research
represents the first successful attempt to address a long-standing problem in
the field of time-lapse microscopy in the root meristem by proposing an
accurate tracking method for Arabidopsis root nuclei.

Abstract: Building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents is a promising research
direction, which simulates human interaction with computers or mobile phones to
perform diverse GUI tasks. However, a major challenge in developing generalized
GUI agents is the lack of sufficient trajectory data across various operating
systems and applications, mainly due to the high cost of manual annotations. In
this paper, we propose the TongUI framework that builds generalized GUI agents
by learning from rich multimodal web tutorials. Concretely, we crawl and
process online GUI tutorials (such as videos and articles) into GUI agent
trajectory data, through which we produce the GUI-Net dataset containing 143K
trajectory data across five operating systems and more than 200 applications.
We develop the TongUI agent by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B models on GUI-Net,
which show remarkable performance improvements on commonly used grounding and
navigation benchmarks, outperforming baseline agents about 10\% on multiple
benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of the GUI-Net dataset and underscoring
the significance of our TongUI framework. We will fully open-source the code,
the GUI-Net dataset, and the trained models soon.

Abstract: Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection algorithms (MUAD) are receiving
increasing attention due to their relatively low deployment costs and improved
training efficiency. However, the real-world effectiveness of MUAD methods is
questioned due to limitations in current Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD)
datasets. These datasets contain numerous classes that are unlikely to be
produced by the same factory and fail to cover multiple structures or
appearances. Additionally, the defects do not reflect real-world
characteristics. Therefore, we introduce the Heterogeneous Same-Sort Industrial
Anomaly Detection (HSS-IAD) dataset, which contains 8,580 images of
metallic-like industrial parts and precise anomaly annotations. These parts
exhibit variations in structure and appearance, with subtle defects that
closely resemble the base materials. We also provide foreground images for
synthetic anomaly generation. Finally, we evaluate popular IAD methods on this
dataset under multi-class and class-separated settings, demonstrating its
potential to bridge the gap between existing datasets and real factory
conditions. The dataset is available at

their data sources and scenarios, and analyze sensor modalities and supported

Abstract: Existing 3D human pose estimation methods often suffer in performance, when
applied to cross-scenario inference, due to domain shifts in characteristics
such as camera viewpoint, position, posture, and body size. Among these
factors, camera viewpoints and locations {have been shown} to contribute
significantly to the domain gap by influencing the global positions of human
poses. To address this, we propose a novel framework that explicitly conducts
global transformations between pose positions in the camera coordinate systems
of source and target domains. We start with a Pseudo-Label Generation Module
that is applied to the 2D poses of the target dataset to generate pseudo-3D
poses. Then, a Global Transformation Module leverages a human-centered
coordinate system as a novel bridging mechanism to seamlessly align the
positional orientations of poses across disparate domains, ensuring consistent
spatial referencing. To further enhance generalization, a Pose Augmentor is
incorporated to address variations in human posture and body size. This process
is iterative, allowing refined pseudo-labels to progressively improve guidance
for domain adaptation. Our method is evaluated on various cross-dataset
benchmarks, including Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and even outperforms the target-trained
model.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image editing have utilized large-scale multimodal
models to enable intuitive, natural instruction-driven interactions. However,
conventional methods still face significant challenges, particularly in spatial
reasoning, precise region segmentation, and maintaining semantic consistency,
especially in complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
SmartFreeEdit, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates a multimodal large
language model (MLLM) with a hypergraph-enhanced inpainting architecture,
enabling precise, mask-free image editing guided exclusively by natural
language instructions. The key innovations of SmartFreeEdit include:(1)the
introduction of region aware tokens and a mask embedding paradigm that enhance
the spatial understanding of complex scenes;(2) a reasoning segmentation
pipeline designed to optimize the generation of editing masks based on natural
language instructions;and (3) a hypergraph-augmented inpainting module that
ensures the preservation of both structural integrity and semantic coherence
during complex edits, overcoming the limitations of local-based image
generation. Extensive experiments on the Reason-Edit benchmark demonstrate that
SmartFreeEdit surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across multiple
evaluation metrics, including segmentation accuracy, instruction adherence, and
visual quality preservation, while addressing the issue of local information
focus and improving global consistency in the edited image. Our project will be

TLDR: CLIP-Refine是一种后预训练方法，旨在通过1轮训练在小数据集上对齐CLIP模型的多模态特征空间，同时保持零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP模型中存在的模态间隙问题，即图像和文本特征空间的不对齐，以提升下游任务性能。

Method: 采用随机特征对齐（RaFA）和混合对比蒸馏（HyCD）技术，通过最小化与随机参考向量的距离和结合软标签更新模型。

Result: 实验表明，CLIP-Refine成功缩小了模态间隙并提升了零样本性能。

Conclusion: CLIP-Refine是一种高效的方法，可在不增加训练成本或牺牲零样本性能的情况下改善CLIP模型的特征对齐。

Abstract: Contrastive language image pre-training (CLIP) is an essential component of
building modern vision-language foundation models. While CLIP demonstrates
remarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature
spaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text
feature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing
works attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or
fine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or
degradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a
post-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and
fine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training
on small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To
this end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and
hybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features
to follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random
reference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid
soft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and
outputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. This contributes to achieving both
maintaining the past knowledge and learning new knowledge to align features.
Our extensive experiments with multiple classification and retrieval tasks show
that CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigating the modality gap and improving the
zero-shot performance.

*Runyi Hu,Jie Zhang,Shiqian Zhao,Nils Lukas,Jiwei Li,Qing Guo,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: MaskMark是一个高效灵活的图像水印框架，包含支持全局和局部水印的两种变体，性能优越且计算成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有水印技术在全局和局部水印提取、定位及多水印嵌入方面的不足，同时保持高视觉质量和低计算成本。

Method: 基于Encoder-Distortion-Decoder训练范式，MaskMark-D通过解码阶段的掩码机制支持全局和局部水印提取；MaskMark-ED进一步在编码阶段引入掩码以增强局部水印的鲁棒性。

Result: MaskMark在全局和局部水印提取、定位及多水印嵌入方面表现最优，超越现有基线模型，同时计算成本仅为WAM的1/15。

Conclusion: MaskMark是一种高效、灵活且性能优越的水印框架，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: We present MaskMark, a simple, efficient and flexible framework for image
watermarking. MaskMark has two variants: MaskMark-D, which supports global
watermark embedding, watermark localization, and local watermark extraction for
applications such as tamper detection, and MaskMark-ED, which focuses on local
watermark embedding and extraction with enhanced robustness in small regions,
enabling localized image protection. Built upon the classical Encoder-
Distortion-Decoder training paradigm, MaskMark-D introduces a simple masking
mechanism during the decoding stage to support both global and local watermark
extraction. A mask is applied to the watermarked image before extraction,
allowing the decoder to focus on selected regions and learn local extraction. A
localization module is also integrated into the decoder to identify watermark
regions during inference, reducing interference from irrelevant content and
improving accuracy. MaskMark-ED extends this design by incorporating the mask
into the encoding stage as well, guiding the encoder to embed the watermark in
designated local regions for enhanced robustness. Comprehensive experiments
show that MaskMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in global watermark
extraction, local watermark extraction, watermark localization, and
multi-watermark embedding. It outperforms all existing baselines, including the
recent leading model WAM for local watermarking, while preserving high visual
quality of the watermarked images. MaskMark is also flexible, by adjusting the
distortion layer, it can adapt to different robustness requirements with just a
few steps of fine-tuning. Moreover, our approach is efficient and easy to
optimize, requiring only 20 hours on a single A6000 GPU with just 1/15 the
computational cost of WAM.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种跨图像反个性化（CAP）框架，通过在多图像中强制风格一致性来增强隐私保护，并开发了动态比率调整策略以优化攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反个性化方法忽视了多图像之间的关系，仅独立添加扰动，未能充分利用图像间的关联性以提供更强的隐私保护。

Method: 提出CAP框架，通过跨图像风格一致性增强扰动效果，并采用动态比率调整策略平衡一致性损失的影响。

Result: 在CelebHQ和VGGFace2基准测试中，CAP显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAP通过多图像协同扰动和动态调整策略，有效提升了反个性化隐私保护的效果。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models and personalization techniques has
made it possible to recreate individual portraits from just a few publicly
available images. While such capabilities empower various creative
applications, they also introduce serious privacy concerns, as adversaries can
exploit them to generate highly realistic impersonations. To counter these
threats, anti-personalization methods have been proposed, which add adversarial
perturbations to published images to disrupt the training of personalization
models. However, existing approaches largely overlook the intrinsic multi-image
nature of personalization and instead adopt a naive strategy of applying
perturbations independently, as commonly done in single-image settings. This
neglects the opportunity to leverage inter-image relationships for stronger
privacy protection. Therefore, we advocate for a group-level perspective on
privacy protection against personalization. Specifically, we introduce
Cross-image Anti-Personalization (CAP), a novel framework that enhances
resistance to personalization by enforcing style consistency across perturbed
images. Furthermore, we develop a dynamic ratio adjustment strategy that
adaptively balances the impact of the consistency loss throughout the attack
iterations. Extensive experiments on the classical CelebHQ and VGGFace2
benchmarks show that CAP substantially improves existing methods.

### [123] [LAD-Reasoner: Tiny Multimodal Models are Good Reasoners for Logical Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12749)
*Weijia Li,Guanglei Chu,Jiong Chen,Guo-Sen Xie,Caifeng Shan,Fang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的任务RLAD和框架LAD-Reasoner，通过结合逻辑推理改进传统异常检测，采用两阶段训练方法，性能接近更大模型且更易解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业异常检测方法依赖复杂模块或设计，难以部署和解释，需要更高效的逻辑异常分析方法。

Method: 提出LAD-Reasoner框架，基于Qwen2.5-VL 3B模型，采用SFT和GRPO两阶段训练，结合检测准确性和输出质量优化。

Result: 在MVTec LOCO AD数据集上，LAD-Reasoner性能接近Qwen2.5-VL-72B，且生成更简洁可解释的结果。

Conclusion: LAD-Reasoner减少了对大模型和复杂流程的依赖，提供了透明且可解释的逻辑异常检测方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in industrial anomaly detection have highlighted the need for
deeper logical anomaly analysis, where unexpected relationships among objects,
counts, and spatial configurations must be identified and explained. Existing
approaches often rely on large-scale external reasoning modules or elaborate
pipeline designs, hindering practical deployment and interpretability. To
address these limitations, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Logical Anomaly
Detection (RLAD), which extends traditional anomaly detection by incorporating
logical reasoning. We propose a new framework, LAD-Reasoner, a customized tiny
multimodal language model built on Qwen2.5-VL 3B. Our approach leverages a
two-stage training paradigm that first employs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for
fine-grained visual understanding, followed by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to refine logical anomaly detection and enforce coherent,
human-readable reasoning. Crucially, reward signals are derived from both the
detection accuracy and the structural quality of the outputs, obviating the
need for building chain of thought (CoT) reasoning data. Experiments on the
MVTec LOCO AD dataset show that LAD-Reasoner, though significantly smaller,
matches the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B in accuracy and F1 score, and further
excels in producing concise and interpretable rationales. This unified design
reduces reliance on large models and complex pipelines, while offering
transparent and interpretable insights into logical anomaly detection. Code and
data will be released.

*Siyu Chen,Ting Han,Changshe Zhang,Xin Luo,Meiliu Wu,Guorong Cai,Jinhe Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出DepthForge框架，通过结合深度信息与视觉基础模型（VFMs）特征，提升域泛化语义分割（DGSS）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉线索易受干扰，而几何信息（如深度）更稳定，因此研究如何将深度信息与VFMs结合以增强几何一致性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出DepthForge框架，集成冻结的DINOv2/EVA02视觉特征和Depth Anything V2深度信息，通过深度感知可学习令牌和深度细化解码器优化模型。

Result: 在多种DGSS设置和五个未见目标域数据集上，DepthForge显著优于其他方法，尤其在极端条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: DepthForge通过深度信息增强VFMs，显著提升了泛化能力和性能，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have delivered remarkable performance in
Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). However, recent methods often
overlook the fact that visual cues are susceptible, whereas the underlying
geometry remains stable, rendering depth information more robust. In this
paper, we investigate the potential of integrating depth information with
features from VFMs, to improve the geometric consistency within an image and
boost the generalization performance of VFMs. We propose a novel fine-tuning
DGSS framework, named DepthForge, which integrates the visual cues from frozen
DINOv2 or EVA02 and depth cues from frozen Depth Anything V2. In each layer of
the VFMs, we incorporate depth-aware learnable tokens to continuously decouple
domain-invariant visual and spatial information, thereby enhancing depth
awareness and attention of the VFMs. Finally, we develop a depth refinement
decoder and integrate it into the model architecture to adaptively refine
multi-layer VFM features and depth-aware learnable tokens. Extensive
experiments are conducted based on various DGSS settings and five different
datsets as unseen target domains. The qualitative and quantitative results
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms alternative approaches
with stronger performance, steadier visual-spatial attention, and superior
generalization ability. In particular, DepthForge exhibits outstanding
performance under extreme conditions (e.g., night and snow). Code is available
at https://github.com/anonymouse-xzrptkvyqc/DepthForge.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: ANT是一种新的微调框架，通过自动引导去噪轨迹避免生成有害内容，解决了现有概念擦除方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保文本到图像模型的伦理部署需要防止生成有害或不适当内容的技术。现有方法存在局限性，如破坏采样轨迹或依赖启发式锚概念选择。

Method: ANT通过反转分类器自由引导的条件方向，提出轨迹感知目标，保护早期阶段得分函数场的完整性，并使用增强权重显著性图精确识别关键参数。

Result: ANT在单概念和多概念擦除中均取得最先进结果，生成高质量、安全的输出，且不损害生成保真度。

Conclusion: ANT提供了一种高效、精确的概念擦除方法，为文本到图像模型的伦理部署提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models requires effective
techniques to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. While
concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based
approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting
sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods
rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these
shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which
Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is
built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free
guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content
modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This
inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the
early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image
manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For
single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map
to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly
contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient
erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile
plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both
single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without
compromising the generative fidelity. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: EarthGPT-X是一种新型空间多模态大语言模型（MLLM），专为遥感（RS）图像设计，解决了现有模型在RS领域适应性不足和交互方式受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于遥感图像与自然图像差异显著，现有自然空间模型难以有效适应RS领域，且当前RS MLLMs的交互方式和解释能力有限，限制了其实际应用。

Method: EarthGPT-X通过多模态内容整合方法、跨域单阶段融合训练策略和像素感知模块，统一了引用和定位任务，并支持多源RS图像的综合理解与多粒度交互。

Result: 实验表明，EarthGPT-X在多粒度任务中表现优越，多模态交互灵活，显著推进了MLLM在RS领域的应用。

Conclusion: EarthGPT-X通过创新的方法解决了RS领域的挑战，展现了MLLM在遥感中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in the visual-language area have developed natural
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for spatial reasoning through visual
prompting. However, due to remote sensing (RS) imagery containing abundant
geospatial information that differs from natural images, it is challenging to
effectively adapt natural spatial models to the RS domain. Moreover, current RS
MLLMs are limited in overly narrow interpretation levels and interaction
manner, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address those
challenges, a spatial MLLM named EarthGPT-X is proposed, enabling a
comprehensive understanding of multi-source RS imagery, such as optical,
synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and infrared. EarthGPT-X offers zoom-in and
zoom-out insight, and possesses flexible multi-grained interactive abilities.
Moreover, EarthGPT-X unifies two types of critical spatial tasks (i.e.,
referring and grounding) into a visual prompting framework. To achieve these
versatile capabilities, several key strategies are developed. The first is the
multi-modal content integration method, which enhances the interplay between
images, visual prompts, and text instructions. Subsequently, a cross-domain
one-stage fusion training strategy is proposed, utilizing the large language
model (LLM) as a unified interface for multi-source multi-task learning.
Furthermore, by incorporating a pixel perception module, the referring and
grounding tasks are seamlessly unified within a single framework. In addition,
the experiments conducted demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
EarthGPT-X in multi-grained tasks and its impressive flexibility in multi-modal
interaction, revealing significant advancements of MLLM in the RS field.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: TSGS框架通过分离几何学习和外观优化，解决了透明表面重建中的透明-深度困境，显著提升了3D高斯泼溅技术的几何精度和渲染效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明表面重建在实验室机器人操作等任务中至关重要，但现有3D高斯泼溅技术因透明-深度困境导致几何精度不足。

Method: TSGS分两阶段：几何学习阶段使用抑制镜面反射的输入，外观优化阶段通过各向异性镜面建模提升视觉保真度，同时采用滑动窗口方法提取深度。

Result: 在TransLab数据集上，TSGS显著优于现有方法，几何重建精度提升37.3%，F1分数提高8.0%。

Conclusion: TSGS在保持高效3DGS框架的同时，实现了透明物体的高精度几何重建和逼真渲染。

Abstract: Reconstructing transparent surfaces is essential for tasks such as robotic
manipulation in labs, yet it poses a significant challenge for 3D
reconstruction techniques like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). These methods
often encounter a transparency-depth dilemma, where the pursuit of
photorealistic rendering through standard $\alpha$-blending undermines
geometric precision, resulting in considerable depth estimation errors for
transparent materials. To address this issue, we introduce Transparent Surface
Gaussian Splatting (TSGS), a new framework that separates geometry learning
from appearance refinement. In the geometry learning stage, TSGS focuses on
geometry by using specular-suppressed inputs to accurately represent surfaces.
In the second stage, TSGS improves visual fidelity through anisotropic specular
modeling, crucially maintaining the established opacity to ensure geometric
accuracy. To enhance depth inference, TSGS employs a first-surface depth
extraction method. This technique uses a sliding window over $\alpha$-blending
weights to pinpoint the most likely surface location and calculates a robust
weighted average depth. To evaluate the transparent surface reconstruction task
under realistic conditions, we collect a TransLab dataset that includes complex
transparent laboratory glassware. Extensive experiments on TransLab show that
TSGS achieves accurate geometric reconstruction and realistic rendering of
transparent objects simultaneously within the efficient 3DGS framework.
Specifically, TSGS significantly surpasses current leading methods, achieving a
37.3% reduction in chamfer distance and an 8.0% improvement in F1 score
compared to the top baseline. The code and dataset will be released at
https://longxiang-ai.github.io/TSGS/.

Abstract: Pap smear image segmentation is crucial for cervical cancer diagnosis.
However, traditional segmentation models often struggle with complex cellular
structures and variations in pap smear images. This study proposes a hybrid
Dense-UNet201 optimization approach that integrates a pretrained DenseNet201 as
the encoder for the U-Net architecture and optimizes it using the spider monkey
optimization (SMO) algorithm. The Dense-UNet201 model excelled at feature
extraction. The SMO was modified to handle categorical and discrete parameters.
The SIPaKMeD dataset was used in this study and evaluated using key performance
metrics, including loss, accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice
coefficient. The experimental results showed that Dense-UNet201 outperformed
U-Net, Res-UNet50, and Efficient-UNetB0. SMO Dense-UNet201 achieved a
segmentation accuracy of 96.16%, an IoU of 91.63%, and a Dice coefficient score
of 95.63%. These findings underscore the effectiveness of image preprocessing,
pretrained models, and metaheuristic optimization in improving medical image
analysis and provide new insights into cervical cell segmentation methods.

Conclusion: SADRE为水印去除设定了新标准，提供灵活可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: As digital content becomes increasingly ubiquitous, the need for robust
watermark removal techniques has grown due to the inadequacy of existing
embedding techniques, which lack robustness. This paper introduces a novel
Saliency-Aware Diffusion Reconstruction (SADRE) framework for watermark
elimination on the web, combining adaptive noise injection, region-specific
perturbations, and advanced diffusion-based reconstruction. SADRE disrupts
embedded watermarks by injecting targeted noise into latent representations
guided by saliency masks although preserving essential image features. A
reverse diffusion process ensures high-fidelity image restoration, leveraging
adaptive noise levels determined by watermark strength. Our framework is
theoretically grounded with stability guarantees and achieves robust watermark
removal across diverse scenarios. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art
(SOTA) watermarking techniques demonstrate SADRE's superiority in balancing
watermark disruption and image quality. SADRE sets a new benchmark for
watermark elimination, offering a flexible and reliable solution for real-world
web content. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成AI取得了显著进展，4D动态物体生成仍面临数据不足和计算需求高的挑战。TwoSquared旨在通过分解问题解决这一难题。

Method: TwoSquared分为两步：1）基于高质量3D数据的图像到3D生成模块；2）物理启发的变形模块预测中间动作。

Result: 实验表明，TwoSquared仅需两张2D图像即可生成纹理和几何一致的4D序列。

Conclusion: TwoSquared无需模板或类别先验知识，能够处理真实场景图像，为4D动态生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the astonishing progress in generative AI, 4D dynamic object
generation remains an open challenge. With limited high-quality training data
and heavy computing requirements, the combination of hallucinating unseen
geometry together with unseen movement poses great challenges to generative
models. In this work, we propose TwoSquared as a method to obtain a 4D
physically plausible sequence starting from only two 2D RGB images
corresponding to the beginning and end of the action. Instead of directly
solving the 4D generation problem, TwoSquared decomposes the problem into two
steps: 1) an image-to-3D module generation based on the existing generative
model trained on high-quality 3D assets, and 2) a physically inspired
deformation module to predict intermediate movements. To this end, our method
does not require templates or object-class-specific prior knowledge and can
take in-the-wild images as input. In our experiments, we demonstrate that
TwoSquared is capable of producing texture-consistent and geometry-consistent
4D sequences only given 2D images.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to training specialized instruction-based
image-editing diffusion models, addressing key challenges in structural
preservation with input images and semantic alignment with user prompts. We
introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion
model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or
curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the realism and
alignment with instructions in two ways. First, the proposed models achieve
precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while
maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. Second, they capture
fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling
detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. This
approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring

results demonstrate that our models can perform intricate edits in complex
scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of

simulated environments through targeted sim-to-real image edits improves their
utility as proxies for real-world settings.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) inversion have demonstrated excellent
performance in image inpainting that aims to restore lost or damaged image
texture using its unmasked content. Previous GAN inversion-based methods
usually utilize well-trained GAN models as effective priors to generate the
realistic regions for missing holes. Despite excellence, they ignore a hard
constraint that the unmasked regions in the input and the output should be the
same, resulting in a gap between GAN inversion and image inpainting and thus
degrading the performance. Besides, existing GAN inversion approaches often
consider a single modality of the input image, neglecting other auxiliary cues
in images for improvements. Addressing these problems, we propose a novel GAN
inversion approach, dubbed MMInvertFill, for image inpainting. MMInvertFill
contains primarily a multimodal guided encoder with a pre-modulation and a GAN
generator with F&W+ latent space. Specifically, the multimodal encoder aims to
enhance the multi-scale structures with additional semantic segmentation edge
texture modalities through a gated mask-aware attention module. Afterwards, a
pre-modulation is presented to encode these structures into style vectors. To
mitigate issues of conspicuous color discrepancy and semantic inconsistency, we
introduce the F&W+ latent space to bridge the gap between GAN inversion and
image inpainting. Furthermore, in order to reconstruct faithful and
photorealistic images, we devise a simple yet effective Soft-update Mean Latent
module to capture more diversified in-domain patterns for generating
high-fidelity textures for massive corruptions. In our extensive experiments on
six challenging datasets, we show that our MMInvertFill qualitatively and
quantitatively outperforms other state-of-the-arts and it supports the
completion of out-of-domain images effectively.

Abstract: Contemporary digital technology has a pivotal role in the design of
customized medical appliances, including occlusal splints used in the treatment
of stomatognathic system dysfunctions. We present an approach to computer-aided
design and precision assessment of positioning occlusal splints, bridging
clinical concepts with current digital dental practice. In our model, a 3D
splint is generated based on a transformation matrix that represents the
therapeutic change in mandibular position, defined by a specialist using a
virtual patient model reconstructed from intraoral scans, CBCT, 3D facial scans
and plaster model digitisation. The paper introduces a novel method for
generating splints that accurately reproduce occlusal conditions in the
therapeutic position, including a mechanism for resolving surface conflicts
through virtual embossing. We demonstrate how transformation matrices can be
acquired through clinical tools and intraoral devices, and evaluate the
accuracy of the designed and printed splints using profile and surface
deviation analysis. The proposed method enables reproducible, patient-specific
splint fabrication and opens new possibilities in diagnostics, multimodal image
registration and quantification of occlusal discrepancies.

Result: 在RGB-T数据集上表现优于现有方法，且在跨模态场景中具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Multispectral imaging plays a critical role in a range of intelligent
transportation applications, including advanced driver assistance systems
(ADAS), traffic monitoring, and night vision. However, accurate visible and
thermal (RGB-T) image registration poses a significant challenge due to the
considerable modality differences. In this paper, we present a novel joint
Self-Correlation and Cross-Correspondence Estimation Framework (SC3EF),
leveraging both local representative features and global contextual cues to
effectively generate RGB-T correspondences. For this purpose, we design a
convolution-transformer-based pipeline to extract local representative features
and encode global correlations of intra-modality for inter-modality
correspondence estimation between unaligned visible and thermal images. After
merging the local and global correspondence estimation results, we further
employ a hierarchical optical flow estimation decoder to progressively refine
the estimated dense correspondence maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method, outperforming the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on representative RGB-T datasets. Furthermore,
it also shows competitive generalization capabilities across challenging
scenarios, including large parallax, severe occlusions, adverse weather, and
other cross-modal datasets (e.g., RGB-N and RGB-D).

Motivation: 现有基于NeRV的视频表示方法未能充分利用时间冗余，导致率失真性能不佳。

Method: 采用二叉搜索树（BST）组织特征表示，引入优化驱动的非均匀采样策略，动态分配采样密度。

Result: 实验表明，Tree-NeRV在压缩效率和重建质量上优于传统均匀采样方法。

Conclusion: Tree-NeRV通过非均匀采样和动态优化，显著提升了视频编码性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV) have emerged as a powerful
paradigm for video representation, enabling direct mappings from frame indices
to video frames. However, existing NeRV-based methods do not fully exploit
temporal redundancy, as they rely on uniform sampling along the temporal axis,
leading to suboptimal rate-distortion (RD) performance. To address this
limitation, we propose Tree-NeRV, a novel tree-structured feature
representation for efficient and adaptive video encoding. Unlike conventional
approaches, Tree-NeRV organizes feature representations within a Binary Search
Tree (BST), enabling non-uniform sampling along the temporal axis.
Additionally, we introduce an optimization-driven sampling strategy,
dynamically allocating higher sampling density to regions with greater temporal
variation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tree-NeRV achieves superior
compression efficiency and reconstruction quality, outperforming prior uniform
sampling-based methods. Code will be released.

Method: 利用3DGS中Jacobian的稀疏性，提出了一种矩阵无关且GPU并行化的LM优化方法，并通过采样策略和启发式学习率进一步优化效率。

Result: 该方法在低高斯数量下比Adam快6倍，比标准LM快3倍，同时在中等数量下仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出的二阶优化策略显著提升了3DGS的训练效率，为实时渲染提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is widely used for novel view synthesis due to
its high rendering quality and fast inference time. However, 3DGS predominantly
relies on first-order optimizers such as Adam, which leads to long training
times. To address this limitation, we propose a novel second-order optimization
strategy based on Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Conjugate Gradient (CG), which
we specifically tailor towards Gaussian Splatting. Our key insight is that the
Jacobian in 3DGS exhibits significant sparsity since each Gaussian affects only
a limited number of pixels. We exploit this sparsity by proposing a matrix-free
and GPU-parallelized LM optimization. To further improve its efficiency, we
propose sampling strategies for both the camera views and loss function and,
consequently, the normal equation, significantly reducing the computational
complexity. In addition, we increase the convergence rate of the second-order
approximation by introducing an effective heuristic to determine the learning
rate that avoids the expensive computation cost of line search methods. As a
result, our method achieves a $3\times$ speedup over standard LM and
outperforms Adam by $~6\times$ when the Gaussian count is low while remaining
competitive for moderate counts. Project Page:

Result: 相比现有语义结构化压缩方法，显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了冗余计算问题，提升了图像压缩效率。

Abstract: In recent years, image compression for high-level vision tasks has attracted
considerable attention from researchers. Given that object information in
images plays a far more crucial role in downstream tasks than background
information, some studies have proposed semantically structuring the bitstream
to selectively transmit and reconstruct only the information required by these
tasks. However, such methods structure the bitstream after encoding, meaning
that the coding process still relies on the entire image, even though much of
the encoded information will not be transmitted. This leads to redundant
computations. Traditional image compression methods require a two-dimensional
image as input, and even if the unimportant regions of the image are set to
zero by applying a semantic mask, these regions still participate in subsequent
computations as part of the image. To address such limitations, we propose an
image compression method based on a position-indexed self-attention mechanism
that encodes and decodes only the visible parts of the masked image. Compared
to existing semantic-structured compression methods, our approach can
significantly reduce computational costs.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了CNN的解释性，有助于改进特征可视化等技术。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability is concerned with analyzing individual
components in a (convolutional) neural network (CNN) and how they form larger
circuits representing decision mechanisms. These investigations are challenging
since CNNs frequently learn polysemantic channels that encode distinct
concepts, making them hard to interpret. To address this, we propose an
algorithm to disentangle a specific kind of polysemantic channel into multiple
channels, each responding to a single concept. Our approach restructures
weights in a CNN, utilizing that different concepts within the same channel
exhibit distinct activation patterns in the previous layer. By disentangling
these polysemantic features, we enhance the interpretability of CNNs,
ultimately improving explanatory techniques such as feature visualizations.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上表现优异，Occ3D基准上mIoU提升1.4%-4.8%，内存消耗减少27%-72%。

Conclusion: GDFusion通过有效融合时间信息，显著提升了3D语义占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: We present GDFusion, a temporal fusion method for vision-based 3D semantic
occupancy prediction (VisionOcc). GDFusion opens up the underexplored aspects
of temporal fusion within the VisionOcc framework, focusing on both temporal
cues and fusion strategies. It systematically examines the entire VisionOcc
pipeline, identifying three fundamental yet previously overlooked temporal
cues: scene-level consistency, motion calibration, and geometric
complementation. These cues capture diverse facets of temporal evolution and
make distinct contributions across various modules in the VisionOcc framework.
To effectively fuse temporal signals across heterogeneous representations, we
propose a novel fusion strategy by reinterpreting the formulation of vanilla
RNNs. This reinterpretation leverages gradient descent on features to unify the
integration of diverse temporal information, seamlessly embedding the proposed
temporal cues into the network. Extensive experiments on nuScenes demonstrate
that GDFusion significantly outperforms established baselines. Notably, on
Occ3D benchmark, it achieves 1.4\%-4.8\% mIoU improvements and reduces memory
consumption by 27\%-72\%.

Result: 实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: VLCA通过结合语言和视觉空间，成功解决了领域泛化中的挑战。

Abstract: Domain generalization aims at training on source domains to uncover a
domain-invariant feature space, allowing the model to perform robust
generalization ability on unknown target domains. However, due to domain gaps,
it is hard to find reliable common image feature space, and the reason for that
is the lack of suitable basic units for images. Different from image in vision
space, language has comprehensive expression elements that can effectively
convey semantics. Inspired by the semantic completeness of language and
intuitiveness of image, we propose VLCA, which combine language space and
vision space, and connect the multiple image domains by using semantic space as
the bridge domain. Specifically, in language space, by taking advantage of the
completeness of language basic units, we tend to capture the semantic
representation of the relations between categories through word vector
distance. Then, in vision space, by taking advantage of the intuitiveness of
image features, the common pattern of sample features with the same class is
explored through low-rank approximation. In the end, the language
representation is aligned with the vision representation through the multimodal
space of text and image. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

Result: 在MVTec AD、VisA和BTAD数据集上实现了图像和像素级别的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MaPhC2F和BiSQAD方法有效提升了异常检测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a crucial task in computer vision, yet collecting
real-world defect images is inherently difficult due to the rarity and
unpredictability of anomalies. Consequently, researchers have turned to
synthetic methods for training data augmentation. However, existing synthetic
strategies (e.g., naive cut-and-paste or inpainting) overlook the underlying
physical causes of defects, leading to inconsistent, low-fidelity anomalies
that hamper model generalization to real-world complexities. In this thesis, we
introduced a novel pipeline that generates synthetic anomalies through
Math-Physics model guidance, refines them via a Coarse-to-Fine approach and
employs a bi-level optimization strategy with a Synthesis Quality
Estimator(SQE). By incorporating physical modeling of cracks, corrosion, and
deformation, our method produces realistic defect masks, which are subsequently
enhanced in two phases. The first stage (npcF) enforces a PDE-based consistency
to achieve a globally coherent anomaly structure, while the second stage
(npcF++) further improves local fidelity using wavelet transforms and boundary
synergy blocks. Additionally, we leverage SQE-driven weighting, ensuring that
high-quality synthetic samples receive greater emphasis during training. To
validate our approach, we conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely
adopted industrial anomaly detection benchmarks: MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD.
Across these datasets, the proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
results in both image-AUROC and pixel-AUROC, confirming the effectiveness of
our MaPhC2F and BiSQAD.

Abstract: Efficiently transferring Learned Image Compression (LIC) model from human
perception to machine perception is an emerging challenge in vision-centric
representation learning. Existing approaches typically adapt LIC to downstream
tasks in a single-task manner, which is inefficient, lacks task interaction,
and results in multiple task-specific bitstreams. To address these limitations,
we propose an asymmetric adaptor framework that supports multi-task adaptation
within a single model. Our method introduces a shared adaptor to learn general
semantic features and task-specific adaptors to preserve task-level
distinctions. With only lightweight plug-in modules and a frozen base codec,
our method achieves strong performance across multiple tasks while maintaining
compression efficiency. Experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark demonstrate
that our method outperforms both Fully Fine-Tuned and other Parameter Efficient
Fine-Tuned (PEFT) baselines, and validating the effectiveness of multi-vision
transferring.

Abstract: Deep learning-based point cloud modeling has been widely investigated as an
indispensable component of general shape analysis. Recently, transformer and
state space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud
learning. However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds,
which have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment. This paper
presents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point
cloud understanding. Specifically, we down-sample input into multiple levels
through the farthest point sampling. At each level, we perform a series of
k-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries to aggregate multi-scale structural
information. To assist SSM in processing point clouds, we introduce
coordinate-order and inside-out scanning strategies for efficient serialization
of irregular points. Point features are calculated progressively from short
neighbor sequences and long point sequences through vanilla and group Point SSM
blocks, to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies. To evaluate
the proposed method, we build a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named
MedPointS for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation. Extensive
experiments conducted on MedPointS demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance across all tasks. The dataset is available at
https://flemme-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/medpoints.html. Code is merged to

Abstract: Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution (RSISR) reconstructs high-resolution
(HR) remote sensing images from low-resolution inputs to support fine-grained
ground object interpretation. Existing methods face three key challenges: (1)
Difficulty in extracting multi-scale features from spatially heterogeneous RS

visual quality. To address these issues, we propose the Texture Transfer
Residual Denoising Dual Diffusion Model (TTRD3) with three innovations: First,
a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Block (MFAB) employing parallel heterogeneous
convolutional kernels for multi-scale feature extraction. Second, a Sparse
Texture Transfer Guidance (STTG) module that transfers HR texture priors from
reference images of similar scenes. Third, a Residual Denoising Dual Diffusion
Model (RDDM) framework combining residual diffusion for deterministic
reconstruction and noise diffusion for diverse generation. Experiments on
multi-source RS datasets demonstrate TTRD3's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving 1.43% LPIPS improvement and 3.67% FID enhancement compared
to best-performing baselines. Code/model: https://github.com/LED-666/TTRD3.

Motivation: 在部分相关视频检索（PRVR）中，同时实现搜索准确性和效率具有挑战性，多样化上下文表示会增加计算和内存成本。

Method: 提出原型PRVR框架，编码多样化上下文为固定数量原型；引入文本关联和视频理解策略；使用跨模态和单模态重建任务对齐原型与文本特征。

Result: 在TVR、ActivityNet-Captions和QVHighlights上的评估验证了方法的有效性且未牺牲效率。

Conclusion: 原型PRVR框架成功解决了PRVR中准确性与效率的权衡问题。

Abstract: In a retrieval system, simultaneously achieving search accuracy and
efficiency is inherently challenging. This challenge is particularly pronounced
in partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR), where incorporating more diverse
context representations at varying temporal scales for each video enhances
accuracy but increases computational and memory costs. To address this
dichotomy, we propose a prototypical PRVR framework that encodes diverse
contexts within a video into a fixed number of prototypes. We then introduce
several strategies to enhance text association and video understanding within
the prototypes, along with an orthogonal objective to ensure that the
prototypes capture a diverse range of content. To keep the prototypes
searchable via text queries while accurately encoding video contexts, we
implement cross- and uni-modal reconstruction tasks. The cross-modal
reconstruction task aligns the prototypes with textual features within a shared
space, while the uni-modal reconstruction task preserves all video contexts
during encoding. Additionally, we employ a video mixing technique to provide
weak guidance to further align prototypes and associated textual
representations. Extensive evaluations on TVR, ActivityNet-Captions, and
QVHighlights validate the effectiveness of our approach without sacrificing
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模糊视频超分辨率方法因缺乏运动信息和高频细节，难以恢复高分辨率下的清晰细节。

Method: 引入事件信号，设计了一个互惠特征去模糊模块和混合可变形对齐模块，结合帧和事件信息。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，比FMA-Net准确度提升2.59 dB，速度快7.28倍。

Conclusion: Ev-DeblurVSR通过事件信号显著提升了模糊视频超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of blurry video super-resolution (BVSR),
aiming to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from low-resolution (LR) and
blurry inputs. Current BVSR methods often fail to restore sharp details at high
resolutions, resulting in noticeable artifacts and jitter due to insufficient
motion information for deconvolution and the lack of high-frequency details in
LR frames. To address these challenges, we introduce event signals into BVSR
and propose a novel event-enhanced network, Ev-DeblurVSR. To effectively fuse
information from frames and events for feature deblurring, we introduce a
reciprocal feature deblurring module that leverages motion information from
intra-frame events to deblur frame features while reciprocally using global
scene context from the frames to enhance event features. Furthermore, to
enhance temporal consistency, we propose a hybrid deformable alignment module
that fully exploits the complementary motion information from inter-frame
events and optical flow to improve motion estimation in the deformable
alignment process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Ev-DeblurVSR
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. Notably, on real data, our method is +2.59 dB more accurate and
7.28$\times$ faster than the recent best BVSR baseline FMA-Net. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临高维数据、地物稀疏分布和光谱冗余等挑战，导致过拟合和泛化能力受限。

Method: EKGNet结合上下文感知映射模块和动态核生成机制，动态调整卷积核以聚焦关键空间结构。

Result: 在IN、UP和KSC数据集上表现优于主流方法。

Conclusion: EKGNet通过动态专家卷积系统提升模型表示能力，无需增加网络深度或宽度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image
classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground
objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification
overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more efficiently adapt to
ground object distributions while extracting image features without introducing
excessive parameters and skipping redundant information, this paper proposes
EKGNet based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model, consisting of a context-aware
mapping network and a dynamic kernel generation module. The context-aware
mapping module translates global contextual information of hyperspectral inputs
into instructions for combining base convolutional kernels, while the dynamic
kernels are composed of K groups of base convolutions, analogous to K different
types of experts specializing in fundamental patterns across various
dimensions. The mapping module and dynamic kernel generation mechanism form a
tightly coupled system - the former generates meaningful combination weights
based on inputs, while the latter constructs an adaptive expert convolution
system using these weights. This dynamic approach enables the model to focus
more flexibly on key spatial structures when processing different regions,
rather than relying on the fixed receptive field of a single static
convolutional kernel. EKGNet enhances model representation capability through a
3D dynamic expert convolution system without increasing network depth or width.
The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC
datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification
approaches.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在策略探索和视觉感知方面存在不足，影响了推理能力。

Method: 提出NoisyRollout方法，通过混合干净和失真图像的轨迹引入视觉感知多样性，并采用噪声退火计划。

Result: 在5个领域外基准测试中取得最佳性能，同时保持领域内性能。

Conclusion: NoisyRollout有效提升了视觉语言模型的探索能力和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have strengthened the
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, enhancing
policy exploration to more effectively scale test-time compute remains
underexplored in VLMs. In addition, VLMs continue to struggle with imperfect
visual perception, which in turn affects the subsequent reasoning process. To
this end, we propose NoisyRollout, a simple yet effective RL approach that
mixes trajectories from both clean and moderately distorted images to introduce
targeted diversity in visual perception and the resulting reasoning patterns.
Without additional training cost, NoisyRollout enhances the exploration
capabilities of VLMs by incorporating a vision-oriented inductive bias.
Furthermore, NoisyRollout employs a noise annealing schedule that gradually
reduces distortion strength over training, ensuring benefit from noisy signals
early while maintaining training stability and scalability in later stages.
With just 2.1K training samples, NoisyRollout achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source RL-tuned models on 5 out-of-domain benchmarks
spanning both reasoning and perception tasks, while preserving comparable or
even better in-domain performance.

Conclusion: 分布式成像方法为智能眼镜的小型化和高性能成像提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years smart glasses technology has rapidly advanced, opening up
entirely new areas for mobile computing. We expect future smart glasses will
need to be all-day wearable, adopting a small form factor to meet the
requirements of volume, weight, fashionability and social acceptability, which
puts significant constraints on the space of possible solutions. Additional
challenges arise due to the fact that smart glasses are worn in arbitrary
environments while their wearer moves and performs everyday activities. In this
paper, we systematically analyze the space of imaging from smart glasses and
derive several fundamental limits that govern this imaging domain. We discuss
the impact of these limits on achievable image quality and camera module size
-- comparing in particular to related devices such as mobile phones. We then
propose a novel distributed imaging approach that allows to minimize the size
of the individual camera modules when compared to a standard monolithic camera
design. Finally, we demonstrate the properties of this novel approach in a
series of experiments using synthetic data as well as images captured with two
different prototype implementations.

Result: 在六种模型和数据集组合中，AUC值超过0.937，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ArtistAuditor在现实场景中表现优异，为版权保护提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image models based on diffusion processes, such as DALL-E, Stable
Diffusion, and Midjourney, are capable of transforming texts into detailed
images and have widespread applications in art and design. As such, amateur
users can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's
work and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright
infringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually
imperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles
(perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in
the artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model
has been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model
retraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable.
  To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the
text-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to
identify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of
specific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely,
ArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style
representations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then,
ArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions.
The experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that
ArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying
ArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights
into the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
ArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario. ArtistAuditor

Result: 在超过100万张超声图像上训练，显著减少引导误差，优于现有视觉骨干和引导框架。

Conclusion: EchoWorld成功捕捉关键超声心动图知识，为AI辅助扫描提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Echocardiography is crucial for cardiovascular disease detection but relies
heavily on experienced sonographers. Echocardiography probe guidance systems,
which provide real-time movement instructions for acquiring standard plane
images, offer a promising solution for AI-assisted or fully autonomous
scanning. However, developing effective machine learning models for this task
remains challenging, as they must grasp heart anatomy and the intricate
interplay between probe motion and visual signals. To address this, we present
EchoWorld, a motion-aware world modeling framework for probe guidance that
encodes anatomical knowledge and motion-induced visual dynamics, while
effectively leveraging past visual-motion sequences to enhance guidance
precision. EchoWorld employs a pre-training strategy inspired by world modeling
principles, where the model predicts masked anatomical regions and simulates
the visual outcomes of probe adjustments. Built upon this pre-trained model, we
introduce a motion-aware attention mechanism in the fine-tuning stage that
effectively integrates historical visual-motion data, enabling precise and
adaptive probe guidance. Trained on more than one million ultrasound images
from over 200 routine scans, EchoWorld effectively captures key
echocardiographic knowledge, as validated by qualitative analysis. Moreover,
our method significantly reduces guidance errors compared to existing visual
backbones and guidance frameworks, excelling in both single-frame and
sequential evaluation protocols. Code is available at

Result: 模型能够生成高质量、长时长且符合电影语法的视频。

Conclusion: SkyReels-V2为长视频生成和专业电影风格提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have been driven by diffusion models and
autoregressive frameworks, yet critical challenges persist in harmonizing
prompt adherence, visual quality, motion dynamics, and duration: compromises in
motion dynamics to enhance temporal visual quality, constrained video duration
(5-10 seconds) to prioritize resolution, and inadequate shot-aware generation
stemming from general-purpose MLLMs' inability to interpret cinematic grammar,
such as shot composition, actor expressions, and camera motions. These
intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional
film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an
Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large
Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and
Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural
representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the
Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with
human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named
SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish
progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation,
followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific
Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic
distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework
with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an
efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity. All the

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dual-region augmentation approach designed to
reduce reliance on large-scale labeled datasets while improving model
robustness and adaptability across diverse computer vision tasks, including
source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) and person re-identification (ReID). Our
method performs targeted data transformations by applying random noise
perturbations to foreground objects and spatially shuffling background patches.
This effectively increases the diversity of the training data, improving model
robustness and generalization. Evaluations on the PACS dataset for SFDA
demonstrate that our augmentation strategy consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements in both single-target and
multi-target adaptation settings. By augmenting training data through
structured transformations, our method enables model generalization across

Conclusion: TryOffDiff为VTOFF提供了高效解决方案，并与VTON模型结合，减少了不必要属性转移，推动了虚拟试穿技术的发展。

Abstract: Computer vision is transforming fashion through Virtual Try-On (VTON) and
Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF). VTON generates images of a person in a specified
garment using a target photo and a standardized garment image, while a more
challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo
of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, on the other hand, extracts
standardized garment images from clothed individuals. We introduce TryOffDiff,
a diffusion-based VTOFF model. Built on a latent diffusion framework with
SigLIP image conditioning, it effectively captures garment properties like
texture, shape, and patterns. TryOffDiff achieves state-of-the-art results on
VITON-HD and strong performance on DressCode dataset, covering upper-body,
lower-body, and dresses. Enhanced with class-specific embeddings, it pioneers
multi-garment VTOFF, the first of its kind. When paired with VTON models, it

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上，EventVAD使用7B MLLM在训练无关设置中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: EventVAD通过事件感知和时间推理有效解决了视频异常检测中的泛化和定位问题。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos.
Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often
struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to
detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual
transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware
video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph
architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning.
Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with
time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs
adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event
boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary
detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and
improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it
utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing
reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive
experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate
that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free
settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.

Abstract: This study conducts a detailed comparison of RF-DETR object detection base
model and YOLOv12 object detection model configurations for detecting
greenfruits in a complex orchard environment marked by label ambiguity,
occlusions, and background blending. A custom dataset was developed featuring
both single-class (greenfruit) and multi-class (occluded and non-occluded
greenfruits) annotations to assess model performance under dynamic real-world
conditions. RF-DETR object detection model, utilizing a DINOv2 backbone and
deformable attention, excelled in global context modeling, effectively
identifying partially occluded or ambiguous greenfruits. In contrast, YOLOv12
leveraged CNN-based attention for enhanced local feature extraction, optimizing
it for computational efficiency and edge deployment. RF-DETR achieved the
highest mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.9464 in single-class detection,
proving its superior ability to localize greenfruits in cluttered scenes.
Although YOLOv12N recorded the highest mAP@50:95 of 0.7620, RF-DETR
consistently outperformed in complex spatial scenarios. For multi-class
detection, RF-DETR led with an mAP@50 of 0.8298, showing its capability to
differentiate between occluded and non-occluded fruits, while YOLOv12L scored
highest in mAP@50:95 with 0.6622, indicating better classification in detailed
occlusion contexts. Training dynamics analysis highlighted RF-DETR's swift
convergence, particularly in single-class settings where it plateaued within 10
epochs, demonstrating the efficiency of transformer-based architectures in
adapting to dynamic visual data. These findings validate RF-DETR's
effectiveness for precision agricultural applications, with YOLOv12 suited for
fast-response scenarios. >Index Terms: RF-DETR object detection, YOLOv12,

Abstract: Flow matching models have emerged as a strong alternative to diffusion
models, but existing inversion and editing methods designed for diffusion are
often ineffective or inapplicable to them. The straight-line, non-crossing
trajectories of flow models pose challenges for diffusion-based approaches but
also open avenues for novel solutions. In this paper, we introduce a
predictor-corrector-based framework for inversion and editing in flow models.
First, we propose Uni-Inv, an effective inversion method designed for accurate
reconstruction. Building on this, we extend the concept of delayed injection to
flow models and introduce Uni-Edit, a region-aware, robust image editing
approach. Our methodology is tuning-free, model-agnostic, efficient, and
effective, enabling diverse edits while ensuring strong preservation of
edit-irrelevant regions. Extensive experiments across various generative models
demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of Uni-Inv and Uni-Edit, even
under low-cost settings. Project page: https://uniedit-flow.github.io/

Conclusion: 研究为评估人工创造力提供了理论基础，并为提升VLMs的创意生成提供了实用指南。

Abstract: The ability to combine existing concepts into novel ideas stands as a
fundamental hallmark of human intelligence. Recent advances in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) like GPT-4V and DALLE-3 have sparked debate about whether their
outputs reflect combinational creativity--defined by M. A. Boden (1998) as
synthesizing novel ideas through combining existing concepts--or sophisticated
pattern matching of training data. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science,
we investigate the combinational creativity of VLMs from the lens of concept
blending. We propose the Identification-Explanation-Implication (IEI)
framework, which decomposes creative processes into three levels: identifying
input spaces, extracting shared attributes, and deriving novel semantic
implications. To validate this framework, we curate CreativeMashup, a
high-quality dataset of 666 artist-generated visual mashups annotated according
to the IEI framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that in
comprehension tasks, best VLMs have surpassed average human performance while
falling short of expert-level understanding; in generation tasks, incorporating
our IEI framework into the generation pipeline significantly enhances the
creative quality of VLMs outputs. Our findings establish both a theoretical
foundation for evaluating artificial creativity and practical guidelines for
improving creative generation in VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视频模型（LVMs）在视频理解中存在与人类直觉不一致和视频幻觉的问题，需要改进。

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise in video understanding but often suffer from misalignment with human
intuition and video hallucination issues. To address these challenges, we
introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal
Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference
alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall
video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal
semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial
objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained
video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of
7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with
spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and
bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video
Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that
VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively
mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/HaroldChen19/VistaDPO.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种可扩展的合成字幕生成技术，用于视觉语言模型预训练，展示了大规模低幻觉合成字幕的双重优势，并验证了其在性能提升上的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型预训练范式高度依赖高质量图像-文本对，但随着模型和数据规模指数增长，此类数据稀缺且饱和，限制了领域进一步发展。

Method: 提出了一种生成高质量、低幻觉且知识丰富的合成字幕的新流程，采用连续DPO方法显著减少幻觉。

Result: 合成字幕在35项视觉语言任务中性能提升至少6.2%，在文本到图像领域FID分数显著降低。

Conclusion: 大规模低幻觉合成字幕可作为真实数据的替代方案，显著提升模型性能，并发布了Hunyuan-Recap100M数据集。

Abstract: In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has
experienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement
of textual capabilities in large language models. However, existing training
paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality
image-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the
availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce
and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.
This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for
vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale
low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a
viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2)
achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language
models through empirical validation. This paper presents three key
contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality,
low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO
methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically,
the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2%
to 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals
that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their
counterparts. Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data
achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text
pairs and other previous work. Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support
in the text-to-image domain. With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1
on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation
benchmark. 3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and
knowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to integrating scientific knowledge into
generative models, enhancing their realism and consistency in image synthesis.
First, we introduce Science-T2I, an expert-annotated adversarial dataset
comprising adversarial 20k image pairs with 9k prompts, covering wide distinct
scientific knowledge categories. Leveraging Science-T2I, we present SciScore,
an end-to-end reward model that refines the assessment of generated images
based on scientific knowledge, which is achieved by augmenting both the
scientific comprehension and visual capabilities of pre-trained CLIP model.
Additionally, based on SciScore, we propose a two-stage training framework,
comprising a supervised fine-tuning phase and a masked online fine-tuning
phase, to incorporate scientific knowledge into existing generative models.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in establishing new standards for evaluating the scientific realism
of generated content. Specifically, SciScore attains performance comparable to
human-level, demonstrating a 5% improvement similar to evaluations conducted by
experienced human evaluators. Furthermore, by applying our proposed fine-tuning
method to FLUX, we achieve a performance enhancement exceeding 50% on SciScore.

TLDR: PCBEAR提出了一种基于人体姿态序列的概念瓶颈框架，用于可解释的动作识别，通过静态和动态姿态概念捕捉运动动态，实现了高性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频可解释性方法难以捕捉运动动态和时间依赖性的问题，提升动作识别的透明度和可解释性。

Method: 利用人体骨架姿态序列作为运动感知的结构化概念，通过聚类自动发现静态和动态姿态概念，无需人工标注。

Result: 在KTH、Penn-Action和HAA500数据集上验证了高性能分类能力，并提供可解释的运动驱动解释。

Conclusion: PCBEAR不仅预测性能强，还能提供人类可理解的模型推理过程，支持调试和改进模型行为。

Abstract: Human action recognition (HAR) has achieved impressive results with deep
learning models, but their decision-making process remains opaque due to their
black-box nature. Ensuring interpretability is crucial, especially for
real-world applications requiring transparency and accountability. Existing
video XAI methods primarily rely on feature attribution or static textual
concepts, both of which struggle to capture motion dynamics and temporal
dependencies essential for action understanding. To address these challenges,
we propose Pose Concept Bottleneck for Explainable Action Recognition (PCBEAR),
a novel concept bottleneck framework that introduces human pose sequences as
motion-aware, structured concepts for video action recognition. Unlike methods
based on pixel-level features or static textual descriptions, PCBEAR leverages
human skeleton poses, which focus solely on body movements, providing robust
and interpretable explanations of motion dynamics. We define two types of
pose-based concepts: static pose concepts for spatial configurations at
individual frames, and dynamic pose concepts for motion patterns across
multiple frames. To construct these concepts, PCBEAR applies clustering to
video pose sequences, allowing for automatic discovery of meaningful concepts
without manual annotation. We validate PCBEAR on KTH, Penn-Action, and HAA500,
showing that it achieves high classification performance while offering
interpretable, motion-driven explanations. Our method provides both strong
predictive performance and human-understandable insights into the model's
reasoning process, enabling test-time interventions for debugging and improving
model behavior.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一个名为Complex-Edit的基准测试，用于评估基于指令的图像编辑模型在不同复杂度指令下的表现，并揭示了开源模型与闭源模型的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像编辑模型评估缺乏系统性，尤其是在处理复杂指令时。因此，作者希望通过构建一个全面的基准测试来填补这一空白。

Method: 利用GPT-4o自动收集多样化的编辑指令，并通过“Chain-of-Edit”流程生成复杂指令。同时，引入了一套评估指标和基于VLM的自动评估流程。

Result: 研究发现：1）开源模型性能显著低于闭源模型；2）复杂指令会降低模型保留关键元素和美学质量的能力；3）逐步分解复杂指令会进一步降低性能；4）Best-of-N策略能提升结果；5）合成数据训练会导致编辑结果显得不自然。

Conclusion: Complex-Edit基准测试为图像编辑模型的评估提供了系统性工具，并揭示了复杂指令和合成数据对模型性能的影响。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{Complex-Edit}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate instruction-based image editing models across
instructions of varying complexity. To develop this benchmark, we harness
GPT-4o to automatically collect a diverse set of editing instructions at scale.
Our approach follows a well-structured ``Chain-of-Edit'' pipeline: we first
generate individual atomic editing tasks independently and then integrate them
to form cohesive, complex instructions. Additionally, we introduce a suite of
metrics to assess various aspects of editing performance, along with a
VLM-based auto-evaluation pipeline that supports large-scale assessments. Our
benchmark yields several notable insights: 1) Open-source models significantly
underperform relative to proprietary, closed-source models, with the
performance gap widening as instruction complexity increases; 2) Increased
instructional complexity primarily impairs the models' ability to retain key
elements from the input images and to preserve the overall aesthetic quality;
3) Decomposing a complex instruction into a sequence of atomic steps, executed
in a step-by-step manner, substantially degrades performance across multiple
metrics; 4) A straightforward Best-of-N selection strategy improves results for
both direct editing and the step-by-step sequential approach; and 5) We observe
a ``curse of synthetic data'': when synthetic data is involved in model
training, the edited images from such models tend to appear increasingly
synthetic as the complexity of the editing instructions rises -- a phenomenon
that intriguingly also manifests in the latest GPT-4o outputs.

TLDR: St4RTrack是一个前馈框架，通过预测点图同时完成动态视频的3D重建和跟踪，无需依赖4D真值监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态3D重建和点跟踪通常被视为独立任务，但它们有深层联系，St4RTrack旨在统一这两项任务。

Method: 通过预测两帧的点图，捕捉静态和动态场景几何，并通过重投影损失进行自适应。

Result: 提出了新的基准测试，验证了框架的有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: St4RTrack为动态视频的3D重建和跟踪提供了统一的解决方案，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction and point tracking in videos are typically treated
as separate tasks, despite their deep connection. We propose St4RTrack, a
feed-forward framework that simultaneously reconstructs and tracks dynamic
video content in a world coordinate frame from RGB inputs. This is achieved by
predicting two appropriately defined pointmaps for a pair of frames captured at
different moments. Specifically, we predict both pointmaps at the same moment,
in the same world, capturing both static and dynamic scene geometry while
maintaining 3D correspondences. Chaining these predictions through the video
sequence with respect to a reference frame naturally computes long-range
correspondences, effectively combining 3D reconstruction with 3D tracking.
Unlike prior methods that rely heavily on 4D ground truth supervision, we
employ a novel adaptation scheme based on a reprojection loss. We establish a
new extensive benchmark for world-frame reconstruction and tracking,
demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our unified, data-driven
framework. Our code, model, and benchmark will be released.

Result: 方法在开放词汇分割任务中达到最优性能，语义重建速度快30倍。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且一致，支持多粒度开放词汇感知，为语言驱动的场景理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Bridging natural language and 3D geometry is a crucial step toward flexible,
language-driven scene understanding. While recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast and high-quality scene reconstruction,
research has also explored incorporating open-vocabulary understanding into
3DGS. However, most existing methods require iterative optimization over
per-view 2D semantic feature maps, which not only results in inefficiencies but
also leads to inconsistent 3D semantics across views. To address these
limitations, we introduce a training-free framework that constructs a
superpoint graph directly from Gaussian primitives. The superpoint graph
partitions the scene into spatially compact and semantically coherent regions,
forming view-consistent 3D entities and providing a structured foundation for
open-vocabulary understanding. Based on the graph structure, we design an
efficient reprojection strategy that lifts 2D semantic features onto the
superpoints, avoiding costly multi-view iterative training. The resulting
representation ensures strong 3D semantic coherence and naturally supports
hierarchical understanding, enabling both coarse- and fine-grained
open-vocabulary perception within a unified semantic field. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary segmentation performance, with semantic field reconstruction
completed over $30\times$ faster. Our code will be available at

Motivation: 当前基于学习的方法难以处理地面与航拍图像之间的极端视角变化，主要原因是缺乏高质量、配准的训练数据集。

Method: 提出结合3D城市网格的伪合成渲染（如Google Earth）和真实地面图像（如MegaDepth）的混合数据集，用于微调现有算法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅改善了相机估计和场景重建，还在下游任务（如新视角合成）中表现出实用价值。

Abstract: We explore the task of geometric reconstruction of images captured from a
mixture of ground and aerial views. Current state-of-the-art learning-based
approaches fail to handle the extreme viewpoint variation between aerial-ground
image pairs. Our hypothesis is that the lack of high-quality, co-registered
aerial-ground datasets for training is a key reason for this failure. Such data
is difficult to assemble precisely because it is difficult to reconstruct in a
scalable way. To overcome this challenge, we propose a scalable framework
combining pseudo-synthetic renderings from 3D city-wide meshes (e.g., Google
Earth) with real, ground-level crowd-sourced images (e.g., MegaDepth). The
pseudo-synthetic data simulates a wide range of aerial viewpoints, while the
real, crowd-sourced images help improve visual fidelity for ground-level images
where mesh-based renderings lack sufficient detail, effectively bridging the
domain gap between real images and pseudo-synthetic renderings. Using this
hybrid dataset, we fine-tune several state-of-the-art algorithms and achieve
significant improvements on real-world, zero-shot aerial-ground tasks. For
example, we observe that baseline DUSt3R localizes fewer than 5% of
aerial-ground pairs within 5 degrees of camera rotation error, while
fine-tuning with our data raises accuracy to nearly 56%, addressing a major
failure point in handling large viewpoint changes. Beyond camera estimation and
scene reconstruction, our dataset also improves performance on downstream tasks
like novel-view synthesis in challenging aerial-ground scenarios, demonstrating
the practical value of our approach in real-world applications.

Abstract: Personalized image synthesis has emerged as a pivotal application in
text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of images featuring specific
subjects in diverse contexts. While diffusion models have dominated this
domain, auto-regressive models, with their unified architecture for text and

paper investigates the potential of optimizing auto-regressive models for
personalized image synthesis, leveraging their inherent multimodal capabilities
to perform this task. We propose a two-stage training strategy that combines
optimization of text embeddings and fine-tuning of transformer layers. Our
experiments on the auto-regressive model demonstrate that this method achieves
comparable subject fidelity and prompt following to the leading diffusion-based
personalization methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of
auto-regressive models in personalized image generation, offering a new

Abstract: Creating a photorealistic scene and human reconstruction from a single
monocular in-the-wild video figures prominently in the perception of a
human-centric 3D world. Recent neural rendering advances have enabled holistic
human-scene reconstruction but require pre-calibrated camera and human poses,
and days of training time. In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework
that simultaneously performs camera tracking, human pose estimation and
human-scene reconstruction in an online fashion. 3D Gaussian Splatting is
utilized to learn Gaussian primitives for humans and scenes efficiently, and
reconstruction-based camera tracking and human pose estimation modules are
designed to enable holistic understanding and effective disentanglement of pose
and appearance. Specifically, we design a human deformation module to
reconstruct the details and enhance generalizability to out-of-distribution
poses faithfully. Aiming to learn the spatial correlation between human and
scene accurately, we introduce occlusion-aware human silhouette rendering and
monocular geometric priors, which further improve reconstruction quality.
Experiments on the EMDB and NeuMan datasets demonstrate superior or on-par
performance with existing methods in camera tracking, human pose estimation,
novel view synthesis and runtime. Our project page is at

Conclusion: REVERSE框架在减少视觉语言模型幻觉方面表现优异，提供了数据集、模型和代码的开源支持。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding but often suffer
from visual hallucinations, where they generate descriptions of nonexistent
objects, actions, or concepts, posing significant risks in safety-critical
applications. Existing hallucination mitigation methods typically follow one of
two paradigms: generation adjustment, which modifies decoding behavior to align
text with visual inputs, and post-hoc verification, where external models
assess and correct outputs. While effective, generation adjustment methods
often rely on heuristics and lack correction mechanisms, while post-hoc
verification is complicated, typically requiring multiple models and tending to
reject outputs rather than refine them. In this work, we introduce REVERSE, a
unified framework that integrates hallucination-aware training with on-the-fly
self-verification. By leveraging a new hallucination-verification dataset
containing over 1.3M semi-synthetic samples, along with a novel inference-time
retrospective resampling technique, our approach enables VLMs to both detect
hallucinations during generation and dynamically revise those hallucinations.
Our evaluations show that REVERSE achieves state-of-the-art hallucination
reduction, outperforming the best existing methods by up to 12% on CHAIR-MSCOCO

Result: 在结构稳定性、颜色保真度和局部可控性方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: IMAGGarment-1为服装生成提供了高效可控的解决方案，并发布了大规模数据集GarmentBench。

Abstract: This paper presents IMAGGarment-1, a fine-grained garment generation (FGG)
framework that enables high-fidelity garment synthesis with precise control
over silhouette, color, and logo placement. Unlike existing methods that are
limited to single-condition inputs, IMAGGarment-1 addresses the challenges of
multi-conditional controllability in personalized fashion design and digital
apparel applications. Specifically, IMAGGarment-1 employs a two-stage training
strategy to separately model global appearance and local details, while
enabling unified and controllable generation through end-to-end inference. In
the first stage, we propose a global appearance model that jointly encodes
silhouette and color using a mixed attention module and a color adapter. In the
second stage, we present a local enhancement model with an adaptive
appearance-aware module to inject user-defined logos and spatial constraints,
enabling accurate placement and visual consistency. To support this task, we
release GarmentBench, a large-scale dataset comprising over 180K garment
samples paired with multi-level design conditions, including sketches, color
references, logo placements, and textual prompts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior
structural stability, color fidelity, and local controllability performance.

TLDR: 提出了一种空间偏振复用（SPM）方法，通过单次偏振图像重建物体形状和反射率，并应用于动态表面恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模式结构光虽能单次重建形状，但反射率恢复困难，因缺乏入射光角度采样及投影模式与表面颜色纹理的耦合。

Method: 设计了空间复用的偏振模式，通过量化AoLP值实现形状重建，同时通过局部区域投影不同偏振光实现单次椭圆偏振测量，分离镜面和漫反射以估计BRDF。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法能从单次偏振图像中恢复形状、Mueller矩阵和BRDF，并成功应用于动态表面。

Conclusion: SPM方法不仅保留了自然表面外观，还实现了高精度的形状和反射率重建，适用于动态场景。

Abstract: We propose spatial polarization multiplexing (SPM) for reconstructing object
shape and reflectance from a single polarimetric image and demonstrate its
application to dynamic surface recovery. Although single-pattern structured
light enables single-shot shape reconstruction, the reflectance is challenging
to recover due to the lack of angular sampling of incident light and the
entanglement of the projected pattern and the surface color texture. We design
a spatially multiplexed pattern of polarization that can be robustly and
uniquely decoded for shape reconstruction by quantizing the AoLP values. At the
same time, our spatial-multiplexing enables single-shot ellipsometry of linear
polarization by projecting differently polarized light within a local region,
which separates the specular and diffuse reflections for BRDF estimation. We
achieve this spatial polarization multiplexing with a constrained de Bruijn
sequence. Unlike single-pattern structured light with intensity and color, our
polarization pattern is invisible to the naked eye and retains the natural
surface appearance which is essential for accurate appearance modeling and also
interaction with people. We experimentally validate our method on real data.
The results show that our method can recover the shape, the Mueller matrix, and
the BRDF from a single-shot polarimetric image. We also demonstrate the
application of our method to dynamic surfaces.

Conclusion: 通过开放数据和工具，研究为透明和可复现的视频理解研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision-language models are integral to computer vision research, yet many
high-performing models remain closed-source, obscuring their data, design and
training recipe. The research community has responded by using distillation
from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark
results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without
knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific
progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a
Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for
transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard
training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore
large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in
detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M
human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and
spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce
PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks
focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a
video. We make our work fully reproducible by providing data, training recipes,
code & models.

Motivation: 传统视觉编码器需针对不同任务设计特定预训练目标，而PE探索仅通过对比视觉-语言学习生成通用嵌入的可能性。

Method: 采用对比视觉-语言训练，结合语言对齐（多模态语言建模）和空间对齐（密集预测）提取隐藏嵌入。

Result: PE模型在零样本分类、检索、问答及空间任务（检测、深度估计、跟踪）中实现SOTA性能。

Conclusion: PE证明简单视觉-语言训练可生成强大通用嵌入，并通过对齐方法解锁多任务潜力，推动相关研究。

Abstract: We introduce Perception Encoder (PE), a state-of-the-art encoder for image
and video understanding trained via simple vision-language learning.
Traditionally, vision encoders have relied on a variety of pretraining
objectives, each tailored to specific downstream tasks such as classification,
captioning, or localization. Surprisingly, after scaling our carefully tuned
image pretraining recipe and refining with our robust video data engine, we
find that contrastive vision-language training alone can produce strong,
general embeddings for all of these downstream tasks. There is only one caveat:
these embeddings are hidden within the intermediate layers of the network. To
draw them out, we introduce two alignment methods, language alignment for
multimodal language modeling, and spatial alignment for dense prediction.
Together with the core contrastive checkpoint, our PE family of models achieves
state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of tasks, including zero-shot
image and video classification and retrieval; document, image, and video Q&A;
and spatial tasks such as detection, depth estimation, and tracking. To foster
further research, we are releasing our models, code, and a novel dataset of
synthetically and human-annotated videos.

Motivation: 解决复杂MLOps平台（如Kubeflow）的可访问性问题，使不同技术背景的用户都能轻松使用高级ML工具。

Method: 采用分层模块化架构，集成KFP代理、MinIO代理和RAG代理，通过迭代推理和上下文感知处理实现自然语言交互。

Conclusion: 该对话式MLOps助手有效减少了使用门槛，为广泛用户提供了便捷的ML工具访问途径。

Abstract: This paper presents a Large Language Model (LLM) based conversational agent
system designed to enhance human-machine collaboration in Machine Learning
Operations (MLOps). We introduce the Swarm Agent, an extensible architecture
that integrates specialized agents to create and manage ML workflows through
natural language interactions. The system leverages a hierarchical, modular
design incorporating a KubeFlow Pipelines (KFP) Agent for ML pipeline
orchestration, a MinIO Agent for data management, and a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) Agent for domain-specific knowledge integration. Through
iterative reasoning loops and context-aware processing, the system enables
users with varying technical backgrounds to discover, execute, and monitor ML
pipelines; manage datasets and artifacts; and access relevant documentation,
all via intuitive conversational interfaces. Our approach addresses the
accessibility gap in complex MLOps platforms like Kubeflow, making advanced ML
tools broadly accessible while maintaining the flexibility to extend to other
platforms. The paper describes the architecture, implementation details, and
demonstrates how this conversational MLOps assistant reduces complexity and
lowers barriers to entry for users across diverse technical skill levels.

TLDR: ZeroSumEval提出了一种基于零和游戏的动态评估协议，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs），避免了传统方法的过拟合、高成本和偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法（静态数据集、人工评估或基于模型的评估）存在局限性，如过拟合和高成本。ZeroSumEval旨在通过动态游戏评估LLMs的多样能力。

Method: 设计了多种游戏（如安全挑战、经典游戏、知识测试和说服挑战），通过零和游戏动态评估模型的能力。

Result: 实验表明，前沿模型（如GPT和Claude家族）在常见游戏中表现良好，但在需要创造力和新颖问题的任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: ZeroSumEval为LLMs评估提供了标准化且可扩展的框架，揭示了模型在创造力任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has traditionally
relied on static benchmark datasets, human assessments, or model-based
evaluations - methods that often suffer from overfitting, high costs, and
biases. ZeroSumEval is a novel competition-based evaluation protocol that
leverages zero-sum games to assess LLMs with dynamic benchmarks that resist
saturation. ZeroSumEval encompasses a diverse suite of games, including
security challenges (PyJail), classic games (Chess, Liar's Dice, Poker),
knowledge tests (MathQuiz), and persuasion challenges (Gandalf, Debate). These
games are designed to evaluate a range of AI capabilities such as strategic
reasoning, planning, knowledge application, and creativity. Building upon
recent studies that highlight the effectiveness of game-based evaluations for
LLMs, ZeroSumEval enhances these approaches by providing a standardized and
extensible framework. To demonstrate this, we conduct extensive experiments
with >7000 simulations across 7 games and 13 models. Our results show that
while frontier models from the GPT and Claude families can play common games
and answer questions, they struggle to play games that require creating novel
and challenging questions. We also observe that models cannot reliably
jailbreak each other and fail generally at tasks requiring creativity. We
release our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/ZeroSumEval.

Motivation: 当前网络代理研究主要关注导航和交易任务，而忽略了大规模结构化数据提取的需求。

Method: 提出BardeenAgent框架，将代理执行转化为可重复程序，并利用HTML的规律结构生成通用CSS选择器。

Result: 在WebLists基准上，BardeenAgent召回率达到66%，是现有最佳代理的两倍，且成本降低3倍。

Conclusion: BardeenAgent为大规模数据提取任务提供了高效解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Most recent web agent research has focused on navigation and transaction
tasks, with little emphasis on extracting structured data at scale. We present
WebLists, a benchmark of 200 data-extraction tasks across four common business
and enterprise use-cases. Each task requires an agent to navigate to a webpage,
configure it appropriately, and extract complete datasets with well-defined
schemas. We show that both LLMs with search capabilities and SOTA web agents
struggle with these tasks, with a recall of 3% and 31%, respectively, despite
higher performance on question-answering tasks.
  To address this challenge, we propose BardeenAgent, a novel framework that
enables web agents to convert their execution into repeatable programs, and
replay them at scale across pages with similar structure. BardeenAgent is also
the first LLM agent to take advantage of the regular structure of HTML. In
particular BardeenAgent constructs a generalizable CSS selector to capture all
relevant items on the page, then fits the operations to extract the data.
  On the WebLists benchmark, BardeenAgent achieves 66% recall overall, more
than doubling the performance of SOTA web agents, and reducing cost per output
row by 3x.

Result: 在5k样本训练后，3B参数的LM在空间推理任务上达到SOTA水平，并展现出系统性分析和上下文整合能力。

Conclusion: Embodied-R展示了高效推理潜力，同时探讨了奖励设计、模型泛化等研究问题。

Abstract: Humans can perceive and reason about spatial relationships from sequential
visual observations, such as egocentric video streams. However, how pretrained
models acquire such abilities, especially high-level reasoning, remains
unclear. This paper introduces Embodied-R, a collaborative framework combining
large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for perception and small-scale
Language Models (LMs) for reasoning. Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
novel reward system considering think-answer logical consistency, the model
achieves slow-thinking capabilities with limited computational resources. After
training on only 5k embodied video samples, Embodied-R with a 3B LM matches
state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning models (OpenAI-o1, Gemini-2.5-pro) on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution embodied spatial reasoning tasks.
Embodied-R also exhibits emergent thinking patterns such as systematic analysis
and contextual integration. We further explore research questions including
response length, training on VLM, strategies for reward design, and differences
in model generalization after SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and RL training.

Motivation: 前沿模型生成的推理痕迹可能被用于模型蒸馏，模型所有者需要在不影响性能的情况下限制这种蒸馏效果。

Method: 采用抗蒸馏采样策略，通过策略性修改模型的下一词概率分布，污染推理痕迹。

Result: 抗蒸馏采样显著降低了推理痕迹对蒸馏的有效性，同时保持了模型的实用性。

Conclusion: 抗蒸馏采样是一种有效的方法，可以在不损害模型性能的前提下防止模型蒸馏。

Abstract: Frontier models that generate extended reasoning traces inadvertently produce
rich token sequences that can facilitate model distillation. Recognizing this
vulnerability, model owners may seek sampling strategies that limit the
effectiveness of distillation without compromising model performance.
\emph{Antidistillation sampling} provides exactly this capability. By
strategically modifying a model's next-token probability distribution,
antidistillation sampling poisons reasoning traces, rendering them
significantly less effective for distillation while preserving the model's
practical utility. For further details, see https://antidistillation.com.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种称为“睡眠时间计算”的方法，通过离线预计算减少测试时的计算需求，显著降低延迟和成本，并在多个任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>

Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在测试时高延迟和高计算成本的问题，作者提出了睡眠时间计算，通过预计算优化性能。

Method: 引入睡眠时间计算，预计算可能的用户查询和有用量，减少测试时计算需求。通过改进Stateful GSM-Symbolic和Stateful AIME任务，验证方法有效性。

Result: 睡眠时间计算可将测试时计算需求减少约5倍，同时通过扩展睡眠时间计算，准确率提升13%（GSM-Symbolic）和18%（AIME）。Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic进一步降低单查询成本2.5倍。

Conclusion: 睡眠时间计算能显著优化LLMs的计算效率和性能，尤其适用于可预测查询的场景，并在实际任务中展示了潜力。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key ingredient for enabling large
language models (LLMs) to solve difficult problems, but comes with high latency
and inference cost. We introduce sleep-time compute, which allows models to
"think" offline about contexts before queries are presented: by anticipating
what queries users might ask and pre-computing useful quantities, we can
significantly reduce the compute requirements at test-time. To demonstrate the
efficacy of our method, we create modified versions of two reasoning tasks -
Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME. We find that sleep-time compute can
reduce the amount of test-time compute needed to achieve the same accuracy by ~
5x on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME and that by scaling sleep-time
compute we can further increase accuracy by up to 13% on Stateful GSM-Symbolic
and 18% on Stateful AIME. Furthermore, we introduce Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic,
which extends GSM-Symbolic by including multiple related queries per context.
By amortizing sleep-time compute across related queries about the same context
using Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, we can decrease the average cost per query by
2.5x. We then conduct additional analysis to understand when sleep-time compute
is most effective, finding the predictability of the user query to be well
correlated with the efficacy of sleep-time compute. Finally, we conduct a
case-study of applying sleep-time compute to a realistic agentic SWE task.

Abstract: Creating responsible artificial intelligence (AI) systems is an important
issue in contemporary research and development of works on AI. One of the
characteristics of responsible AI systems is their explainability. In the
paper, we are interested in explainable deep learning (XDL) systems. On the
basis of the creation of digital twins of physical objects, we introduce the
idea of creating readable twins (in the form of imprecise information flow
models) for unreadable deep learning models. The complete procedure for
switching from the deep learning model (DLM) to the imprecise information flow
model (IIFM) is presented. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example
of a deep learning classification model for image recognition of handwritten

Conclusion: 提出的黑盒隐写方案在保证安全性的同时，提高了实际应用的灵活性。

Abstract: The security of private communication is increasingly at risk due to
widespread surveillance. Steganography, a technique for embedding secret
messages within innocuous carriers, enables covert communication over monitored
channels. Provably Secure Steganography (PSS) is state of the art for making
stego carriers indistinguishable from normal ones by ensuring computational
indistinguishability between stego and cover distributions. However, current
PSS methods often require explicit access to the distribution of generative
model for both sender and receiver, limiting their practicality in black box
scenarios. In this paper, we propose a provably secure steganography scheme
that does not require access to explicit model distributions for both sender
and receiver. Our method incorporates a dynamic sampling strategy, enabling
generative models to embed secret messages within multiple sampling choices
without disrupting the normal generation process of the model. Extensive
evaluations of three real world datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that our
blackbox method is comparable with existing white-box steganography methods in
terms of efficiency and capacity while eliminating the degradation of
steganography in model generated outputs.

Result: 相比通用方法，该系统在性能与效率上表现更优。

Conclusion: 该研究为银行业特定语言文本处理提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the introduction of the PSD2 regulation in the EU which established the
Open Banking framework, a new window of opportunities has opened for banks and
fintechs to explore and enrich Bank transaction descriptions with the aim of
building a better understanding of customer behavior, while using this
understanding to prevent fraud, reduce risks and offer more competitive and
tailored services.
  And although the usage of natural language processing models and techniques
has seen an incredible progress in various applications and domains over the
past few years, custom applications based on domain-specific text corpus remain
unaddressed especially in the banking sector.
  In this paper, we introduce a language-based Open Banking transaction
classification system with a focus on the french market and french language
text. The system encompasses data collection, labeling, preprocessing,
modeling, and evaluation stages. Unlike previous studies that focus on general
classification approaches, this system is specifically tailored to address the
challenges posed by training a language model with a specialized text corpus
(Banking data in the French context). By incorporating language-specific
techniques and domain knowledge, the proposed system demonstrates enhanced
performance and efficiency compared to generic approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate relevance
judgments for information retrieval (IR) tasks, often demonstrating agreement
with human labels that approaches inter-human agreement. To assess the
robustness and reliability of LLM-based relevance judgments, we systematically
investigate impact of prompt sensitivity on the task. We collected prompts for
relevance assessment from 15 human experts and 15 LLMs across three tasks~ --
~binary, graded, and pairwise~ -- ~yielding 90 prompts in total. After
filtering out unusable prompts from three humans and three LLMs, we employed
the remaining 72 prompts with three different LLMs as judges to label
document/query pairs from two TREC Deep Learning Datasets (2020 and 2021). We
compare LLM-generated labels with TREC official human labels using Cohen's
$\kappa$ and pairwise agreement measures. In addition to investigating the
impact of prompt variations on agreement with human labels, we compare human-
and LLM-generated prompts and analyze differences among different LLMs as
judges. We also compare human- and LLM-generated prompts with the standard
UMBRELA prompt used for relevance assessment by Bing and TREC 2024 Retrieval

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in both academic and
industry settings to automate the evaluation of information seeking systems,
particularly by generating graded relevance judgments. Previous work on
LLM-based relevance assessment has primarily focused on replicating graded
human relevance judgments through various prompting strategies. However, there
has been limited exploration of alternative assessment methods or comprehensive
comparative studies. In this paper, we systematically compare multiple
LLM-based relevance assessment methods, including binary relevance judgments,
graded relevance assessments, pairwise preference-based methods, and two
nugget-based evaluation methods~--~document-agnostic and document-dependent. In
addition to a traditional comparison based on system rankings using Kendall
correlations, we also examine how well LLM judgments align with human
preferences, as inferred from relevance grades. We conduct extensive
experiments on datasets from three TREC Deep Learning tracks 2019, 2020 and
2021 as well as the ANTIQUE dataset, which focuses on non-factoid open-domain
question answering. As part of our data release, we include relevance judgments
generated by both an open-source (Llama3.2b) and a commercial (gpt-4o) model.
Our goal is to \textit{reproduce} various LLM-based relevance judgment methods
to provide a comprehensive comparison. All code, data, and resources are

Motivation: 现有的神经IR模型（如ColBERT）需要大量内存存储文档标记的上下文表示，现有修剪方法无法保证不影响检索分数。

Method: 引入三种正则化损失和两种修剪策略，通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法可保留ColBERT性能的同时仅使用30%的标记。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保证性能的前提下显著降低了内存需求，适用于跨领域任务。

Abstract: Late interaction neural IR models like ColBERT offer a competitive
effectiveness-efficiency trade-off across many benchmarks. However, they
require a huge memory space to store the contextual representation for all the
document tokens. Some works have proposed using either heuristics or
statistical-based techniques to prune tokens from each document. This however
doesn't guarantee that the removed tokens have no impact on the retrieval
score. Our work uses a principled approach to define how to prune tokens
without impacting the score between a document and a query. We introduce three
regularization losses, that induce a solution with high pruning ratios, as well
as two pruning strategies. We study them experimentally (in and out-domain),
showing that we can preserve ColBERT's performance while using only 30\% of the
tokens.

for full-document retrieval. Neural models, such as mE5-large and BGE-M3,
demonstrate superior performance on most datasets, but face challenges with
long-document retrieval due to input size constraints. RusBEIR offers a
unified, open-source framework that promotes research in Russian-language

*Nandan Thakur,Jimmy Lin,Sam Havens,Michael Carbin,Omar Khattab,Andrew Drozdov*

Main category: cs.IR

TLDR: FreshStack是一个可重用的框架，用于从社区问答自动构建信息检索（IR）评估基准。它通过自动收集代码和技术文档、生成问题答案片段，并结合混合检索技术构建数据集。实验表明，现有检索模型在五个新兴主题上表现不佳，表明IR质量仍有提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建现实、可扩展且无污染的IR和RAG评估基准，以推动信息检索技术的发展。

Method: FreshStack通过三步构建基准：1) 自动收集代码和技术文档；2) 从社区问答生成片段；3) 结合混合检索技术检索文档。

Result: 在五个新兴主题上，现有检索模型表现显著低于理想方法，且部分主题中重排序未明显提升检索精度。

Conclusion: FreshStack为构建高质量IR评估基准提供了工具，并揭示了现有模型的不足，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: We introduce FreshStack, a reusable framework for automatically building
information retrieval (IR) evaluation benchmarks from community-asked questions
and answers. FreshStack conducts the following steps: (1) automatic corpus
collection from code and technical documentation, (2) nugget generation from
community-asked questions and answers, and (3) nugget-level support, retrieving
documents using a fusion of retrieval techniques and hybrid architectures. We
use FreshStack to build five datasets on fast-growing, recent, and niche topics
to ensure the tasks are sufficiently challenging. On FreshStack, existing
retrieval models, when applied out-of-the-box, significantly underperform
oracle approaches on all five topics, denoting plenty of headroom to improve IR
quality. In addition, we identify cases where rerankers do not clearly improve
first-stage retrieval accuracy (two out of five topics). We hope that
FreshStack will facilitate future work toward constructing realistic, scalable,
and uncontaminated IR and RAG evaluation benchmarks. FreshStack datasets are
available at: https://fresh-stack.github.io.

*Haoxuan Li,Yi Bin,Yunshan Ma,Guoqing Wang,Yang Yang,See-Kiong Ng,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.IR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为SemCORE的新框架，通过结构化自然语言标识符和生成语义验证策略，提升了生成式跨模态检索的语义理解能力，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态检索方法依赖嵌入相似性计算，而生成式检索虽具潜力，但在标识符构建和生成过程中存在语义信息不足的问题。

Method: 提出SemCORE框架，包括结构化自然语言标识符（SID）和生成语义验证（GSV）策略，同时支持文本到图像和图像到文本的双向检索任务。

Result: 实验显示SemCORE在基准数据集上表现优异，文本到图像检索的Recall@1平均提升8.65分。

Conclusion: SemCORE通过增强语义理解能力，为生成式跨模态检索提供了有效解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) is a fundamental task in multimedia research,
focused on retrieving semantically relevant targets across different
modalities. While traditional CMR methods match text and image via
embedding-based similarity calculations, recent advancements in pre-trained
generative models have established generative retrieval as a promising
alternative. This paradigm assigns each target a unique identifier and
leverages a generative model to directly predict identifiers corresponding to
input queries without explicit indexing. Despite its great potential, current
generative CMR approaches still face semantic information insufficiency in both
identifier construction and generation processes. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel unified Semantic-enhanced generative Cross-mOdal REtrieval
framework (SemCORE), designed to unleash the semantic understanding
capabilities in generative cross-modal retrieval task. Specifically, we first
construct a Structured natural language IDentifier (SID) that effectively
aligns target identifiers with generative models optimized for natural language
comprehension and generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Generative Semantic
Verification (GSV) strategy enabling fine-grained target discrimination.
Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, SemCORE is the first framework to
simultaneously consider both text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval tasks
within generative cross-modal retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our framework outperforms state-of-the-art generative cross-modal retrieval
methods. Notably, SemCORE achieves substantial improvements across benchmark
datasets, with an average increase of 8.65 points in Recall@1 for text-to-image
retrieval.

TLDR: 本研究开发了一个AI驱动的知识图谱系统，分析SDG之间的关联，发现潜在新目标，并通过可视化展示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着2030年临近，SDG进展滞后，需要创新加速策略。

Method: 使用官方SDG文本、Elsevier关键词数据集和1,127篇TED演讲（2020-2023），结合AI推测设计、大语言模型和检索增强生成技术。

Result: 发现目标10与16关联强，目标6覆盖少；知识图谱揭示新中心节点；提出6个潜在新目标。

Conclusion: 该AI推测框架为政策制定者提供新见解，并为未来多模态和跨系统SDG应用奠定基础。

Abstract: From 2000 to 2015, the UN's Millennium Development Goals guided global
priorities. The subsequent Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted a more
dynamic approach, with annual indicator updates. As 2030 nears and progress
lags, innovative acceleration strategies are critical. This study develops an
AI-powered knowledge graph system to analyze SDG interconnections, discover
potential new goals, and visualize them online. Using official SDG texts,
Elsevier's keyword dataset, and 1,127 TED Talk transcripts (2020-2023), a pilot
on 269 talks from 2023 applies AI-speculative design, large language models,
and retrieval-augmented generation. Key findings include: (1) Heatmap analysis
reveals strong associations between Goal 10 and Goal 16, and minimal coverage
of Goal 6. (2) In the knowledge graph, simulated dialogue over time reveals new
central nodes, showing how richer data supports divergent thinking and goal
clarity. (3) Six potential new goals are proposed, centered on equity,
resilience, and technology-driven inclusion. This speculative-AI framework
offers fresh insights for policymakers and lays groundwork for future
multimodal and cross-system SDG applications.

*Benign John Ihugba,Afsana Nasrin,Ling Wu,Lin Li,Lijun Qian,Xishuang Dong*

Main category: cs.CY

TLDR: 本文提出了一种利用命名实体识别（NER）技术从大规模枪击事件文本数据中提取关键信息的方法，并构建了首个相关数据集。实验表明，GPT-4o和o1-mini在性能上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模枪击事件产生大量非结构化文本数据，但缺乏自动化工具支持调查和政策制定。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行少样本提示的NER，识别关键实体（如罪犯、受害者、地点等）。

Result: GPT-4o在Micro Precision、Recall和F1分数上表现最优，o1-mini则是资源高效的替代方案。增加样本量能提升所有模型性能，但对GPT-4o和o1-mini效果更显著。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模枪击事件的信息提取提供了高效工具，GPT-4o和o1-mini是NER任务的优选模型。

Abstract: Mass-shooting events pose a significant challenge to public safety,
generating large volumes of unstructured textual data that hinder effective
investigations and the formulation of public policy. Despite the urgency, few
prior studies have effectively automated the extraction of key information from
these events to support legal and investigative efforts. This paper presented
the first dataset designed for knowledge acquisition on mass-shooting events
through the application of named entity recognition (NER) techniques. It
focuses on identifying key entities such as offenders, victims, locations, and
criminal instruments, that are vital for legal and investigative purposes. The
NER process is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) using few-shot
prompting, facilitating the efficient extraction and organization of critical
information from diverse sources, including news articles, police reports, and
social media. Experimental results on real-world mass-shooting corpora
demonstrate that GPT-4o is the most effective model for mass-shooting NER,
achieving the highest Micro Precision, Micro Recall, and Micro F1-scores.
Meanwhile, o1-mini delivers competitive performance, making it a
resource-efficient alternative for less complex NER tasks. It is also observed
that increasing the shot count enhances the performance of all models, but the
gains are more substantial for GPT-4o and o1-mini, highlighting their superior
adaptability to few-shot learning scenarios.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）对在线教育的具体影响，尤其是学术诚信和学习方式的变化。

Method: 分析MOOCs平台上AI伦理课程的学生论文数据，比较ChatGPT发布前后的变化。

Result: 学生论文的长度和风格显著变化，关键词频率增加，但主题未明显改变。

Conclusion: ChatGPT对在线教育的影响主要体现在形式而非内容上，需进一步研究其长期效应。

Abstract: The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 caused a flurry of activity and concern
in the academic and educational communities. Some see the tool's ability to
generate human-like text that passes at least cursory inspections for factual
accuracy ``often enough'' a golden age of information retrieval and
computer-assisted learning. Some, on the other hand, worry the tool may lead to
unprecedented levels of academic dishonesty and cheating. In this work, we
quantify some of the effects of the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs)
on online education by analyzing a multi-year dataset of student essay
responses from a free university-level MOOC on AI ethics. Our dataset includes
essays submitted both before and after ChatGPT's release. We find that the
launch of ChatGPT coincided with significant changes in both the length and
style of student essays, mirroring observations in other contexts such as
academic publishing. We also observe -- as expected based on related public
discourse -- changes in prevalence of key content words related to AI and LLMs,
but not necessarily the general themes or topics discussed in the student
essays as identified through (dynamic) topic modeling.

TLDR: 该研究旨在通过社交媒体数据识别和追踪对贫困人群的偏见（aporophobia），为消除贫困政策提供支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贫困是联合国可持续发展目标的首要问题，但社会对贫困人群的偏见（aporophobia）阻碍了扶贫政策的制定与实施。

Method: 与非营利组织和政府合作，收集并标注英语推文，构建分类器以自动检测aporophobia。

Result: 建立了aporophobia的分类体系，并训练了分类器，但自动检测仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模识别和减少社交媒体上的aporophobia奠定了基础。

Abstract: Eradicating poverty is the first goal in the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals. However, aporophobia -- the societal bias against people
living in poverty -- constitutes a major obstacle to designing, approving and
implementing poverty-mitigation policies. This work presents an initial step
towards operationalizing the concept of aporophobia to identify and track
harmful beliefs and discriminative actions against poor people on social media.
In close collaboration with non-profits and governmental organizations, we
conduct data collection and exploration. Then we manually annotate a corpus of
English tweets from five world regions for the presence of (1) direct
expressions of aporophobia, and (2) statements referring to or criticizing
aporophobic views or actions of others, to comprehensively characterize the
social media discourse related to bias and discrimination against the poor.
Based on the annotated data, we devise a taxonomy of categories of aporophobic
attitudes and actions expressed through speech on social media. Finally, we
train several classifiers and identify the main challenges for automatic
detection of aporophobia in social networks. This work paves the way towards
identifying, tracking, and mitigating aporophobic views on social media at
scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出三种简单修改，使普通Transformer适用于图学习，无需复杂架构变动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图Transformer架构复杂，难以利用Transformer的训练进展，需简化设计。

Method: 1. 使用简化的L2注意力；2. 自适应均方根归一化；3. 共享编码器的相对位置编码偏置。

Result: 在多种图数据集上表现显著提升，图同构测试中展现强表达能力。

Conclusion: 通过简单修改，普通Transformer可有效应用于图学习，性能优越。

Abstract: Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities,
employing scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have
attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph
Transformers are designed with major architectural differences, either
integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention
mechanisms. These complexities prevent the easy adoption of Transformer
training advances. We propose three simple modifications to the plain
Transformer to render it applicable to graphs without introducing major
architectural distortions. Specifically, we advocate for the use of (1)
simplified $L_2$ attention to measure the magnitude closeness of tokens; (2)
adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude
information; and (3) a relative positional encoding bias with a shared encoder.
Significant performance gains across a variety of graph datasets justify the
effectiveness of our proposed modifications. Furthermore, empirical evaluation
on the expressiveness benchmark reveals noteworthy realized expressiveness in
the graph isomorphism.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为VLMGuard-R1的框架，通过多模态推理驱动的提示重写，提升视觉-语言模型的安全性，无需修改模型核心参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言模型的多模态复杂性可能带来传统安全措施无法覆盖的潜在威胁，因此需要一种新的安全对齐方法。

Method: 采用多模态推理驱动的提示重写框架VLMGuard-R1，通过三阶段推理流程生成数据集，训练重写器以动态优化用户输入。

Result: 在三个基准测试和五种视觉-语言模型上，VLMGuard-R1优于四种基线方法，特别是在SIUO基准上平均安全性提升了43.59%。

Conclusion: VLMGuard-R1通过推理驱动的提示重写有效提升了视觉-语言模型的安全性，为多模态模型的安全对齐提供了新方向。

Abstract: Aligning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with safety standards is essential to
mitigate risks arising from their multimodal complexity, where integrating
vision and language unveils subtle threats beyond the reach of conventional
safeguards. Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to
preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM
safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce
VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a
reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to
deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures
without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a
three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter
to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic
refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal
that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1
achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on
the SIUO benchmark.

TLDR: 论文比较了混合经典-量子深度学习模型（HCQ-DL）与经典深度学习模型（C-DL）在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，结果显示HCQ-DL在对抗攻击下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的感知模块依赖深度学习模型，对抗攻击可能导致严重错误分类，因此需要更鲁棒的模型。

Method: 使用AlexNet和VGG-16作为特征提取器，构建HCQ-DL模型，并测试了1000多个量子电路，评估其在PGD、FGSA和GA攻击下的性能。

Result: HCQ-DL在无攻击场景下准确率超过95%，在GA和FGSA攻击下超过91%，PGD攻击下为85%，显著优于C-DL模型。

Conclusion: HCQ-DL模型在对抗攻击下表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性，适用于自动驾驶感知模块。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based image classification models are essential for
autonomous vehicle (AV) perception modules since incorrect categorization might
have severe repercussions. Adversarial attacks are widely studied cyberattacks
that can lead DL models to predict inaccurate output, such as incorrectly
classified traffic signs by the perception module of an autonomous vehicle. In
this study, we create and compare hybrid classical-quantum deep learning
(HCQ-DL) models with classical deep learning (C-DL) models to demonstrate
robustness against adversarial attacks for perception modules. Before feeding
them into the quantum system, we used transfer learning models, alexnet and
vgg-16, as feature extractors. We tested over 1000 quantum circuits in our
HCQ-DL models for projected gradient descent (PGD), fast gradient sign attack
(FGSA), and gradient attack (GA), which are three well-known untargeted
adversarial approaches. We evaluated the performance of all models during
adversarial attacks and no-attack scenarios. Our HCQ-DL models maintain
accuracy above 95\% during a no-attack scenario and above 91\% for GA and FGSA
attacks, which is higher than C-DL models. During the PGD attack, our
alexnet-based HCQ-DL model maintained an accuracy of 85\% compared to C-DL
models that achieved accuracies below 21\%. Our results highlight that the
HCQ-DL models provide improved accuracy for traffic sign classification under
adversarial settings compared to their classical counterparts.

Motivation: 为了建立持久且有意义的评估标准，以判断新方法是否真正改进了解释性。

Method: 提出MIB基准，包含电路定位和因果变量定位两个轨道，分别评估不同方法在定位模型组件或因果变量上的表现。

Result: 电路定位中，归因和掩码优化方法表现最佳；因果变量定位中，监督DAS方法最优，而SAE特征未优于神经元。

Conclusion: MIB能有效比较方法，证明领域内取得真实进展。

Abstract: How can we know whether new mechanistic interpretability methods achieve real
improvements? In pursuit of meaningful and lasting evaluation standards, we
propose MIB, a benchmark with two tracks spanning four tasks and five models.
MIB favors methods that precisely and concisely recover relevant causal
pathways or specific causal variables in neural language models. The circuit
localization track compares methods that locate the model components - and
connections between them - most important for performing a task (e.g.,
attribution patching or information flow routes). The causal variable
localization track compares methods that featurize a hidden vector, e.g.,
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) or distributed alignment search (DAS), and locate
model features for a causal variable relevant to the task. Using MIB, we find
that attribution and mask optimization methods perform best on circuit
localization. For causal variable localization, we find that the supervised DAS
method performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons, i.e.,
standard dimensions of hidden vectors. These findings illustrate that MIB
enables meaningful comparisons of methods, and increases our confidence that
there has been real progress in the field.

Method: 提出Sign-In方法，采用动态重参数化技术，可证明地诱导符号翻转，补充密集到稀疏训练的不足。

Result: 实验和理论表明Sign-In能提升PaI性能，但仍需解决主要挑战以完全缩小性能差距。

Conclusion: Sign-In是一种正交方法，通过符号翻转提升PaI性能，但完全缩小与密集到稀疏训练的性能差距仍是未来研究方向。

Abstract: The performance gap between training sparse neural networks from scratch
(PaI) and dense-to-sparse training presents a major roadblock for efficient
deep learning. According to the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, PaI hinges on
finding a problem specific parameter initialization. As we show, to this end,
determining correct parameter signs is sufficient. Yet, they remain elusive to
PaI. To address this issue, we propose Sign-In, which employs a dynamic
reparameterization that provably induces sign flips. Such sign flips are
complementary to the ones that dense-to-sparse training can accomplish,
rendering Sign-In as an orthogonal method. While our experiments and theory
suggest performance improvements of PaI, they also carve out the main open
challenge to close the gap between PaI and dense-to-sparse training.

Abstract: Human speech goes beyond the mere transfer of information; it is a profound
exchange of emotions and a connection between individuals. While Text-to-Speech
(TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling
the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose
EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language

control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme
tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by
chain-of-thought (CoT) and modality-of-thought (CoM) techniques. Besides, we
introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring
expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language
descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English
EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese
Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability
of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human
perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and
Gemini to assess emotional speech. Demo samples are available at

Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of robotics, dual-arm coordination and complex
object manipulation are essential capabilities for developing advanced
autonomous systems. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality
demonstration data and real-world-aligned evaluation benchmarks severely limits
such development. To address this, we introduce RoboTwin, a generative digital
twin framework that uses 3D generative foundation models and large language
models to produce diverse expert datasets and provide a real-world-aligned
evaluation platform for dual-arm robotic tasks. Specifically, RoboTwin creates
varied digital twins of objects from single 2D images, generating realistic and
interactive scenarios. It also introduces a spatial relation-aware code
generation framework that combines object annotations with large language
models to break down tasks, determine spatial constraints, and generate precise
robotic movement code. Our framework offers a comprehensive benchmark with both
simulated and real-world data, enabling standardized evaluation and better
alignment between simulated training and real-world performance. We validated
our approach using the open-source COBOT Magic Robot platform. Policies
pre-trained on RoboTwin-generated data and fine-tuned with limited real-world
samples demonstrate significant potential for enhancing dual-arm robotic
manipulation systems by improving success rates by over 70% for single-arm
tasks and over 40% for dual-arm tasks compared to models trained solely on
real-world data.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of graph neural networks (GNNs) with
Qualitative Explainable Graphs (QXGs) for scene understanding in automated
driving. Scene understanding is the basis for any further reactive or proactive
decision-making. Scene understanding and related reasoning is inherently an
explanation task: why is another traffic participant doing something, what or
who caused their actions? While previous work demonstrated QXGs' effectiveness
using shallow machine learning models, these approaches were limited to
analysing single relation chains between object pairs, disregarding the broader
scene context. We propose a novel GNN architecture that processes entire graph
structures to identify relevant objects in traffic scenes. We evaluate our
method on the nuScenes dataset enriched with DriveLM's human-annotated
relevance labels. Experimental results show that our GNN-based approach
achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods. The model
effectively handles the inherent class imbalance in relevant object
identification tasks while considering the complete spatial-temporal
relationships between all objects in the scene. Our work demonstrates the
potential of combining qualitative representations with deep learning
approaches for explainable scene understanding in autonomous driving systems.

TLDR: UncAD提出了一种新范式，通过在线地图不确定性提升自动驾驶安全性，减少碰撞和冲突率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法依赖确定性建模，可能引入感知错误，影响规划安全。

Method: UncAD首先估计感知模块中在线地图的不确定性，利用其指导预测和规划生成多模态轨迹，并提出基于不确定性的规划选择策略。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，UncAD仅增加1.9%参数，却降低碰撞率26%和可行驶区域冲突率42%。

Conclusion: UncAD通过不确定性建模显著提升自动驾驶安全性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving aims to produce planning trajectories from raw
sensors directly. Currently, most approaches integrate perception, prediction,
and planning modules into a fully differentiable network, promising great
scalability. However, these methods typically rely on deterministic modeling of
online maps in the perception module for guiding or constraining vehicle
planning, which may incorporate erroneous perception information and further
compromise planning safety. To address this issue, we delve into the importance
of online map uncertainty for enhancing autonomous driving safety and propose a
novel paradigm named UncAD. Specifically, UncAD first estimates the uncertainty
of the online map in the perception module. It then leverages the uncertainty
to guide motion prediction and planning modules to produce multi-modal
trajectories. Finally, to achieve safer autonomous driving, UncAD proposes an
uncertainty-collision-aware planning selection strategy according to the online
map uncertainty to evaluate and select the best trajectory. In this study, we
incorporate UncAD into various state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end methods.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that integrating UncAD, with only a
1.9% increase in parameters, can reduce collision rates by up to 26% and
drivable area conflict rate by up to 42%. Codes, pre-trained models, and demo
videos can be accessed at https://github.com/pengxuanyang/UncAD.

Abstract: Tactile sensing is crucial for achieving human-level robotic capabilities in
manipulation tasks. VBTSs have emerged as a promising solution, offering high
spatial resolution and cost-effectiveness by sensing contact through
camera-captured deformation patterns of elastic gel pads. However, these
sensors' complex physical characteristics and visual signal processing
requirements present unique challenges for robotic applications. The lack of
efficient and accurate simulation tools for VBTS has significantly limited the
scale and scope of tactile robotics research. Here we present Taccel, a
high-performance simulation platform that integrates IPC and ABD to model
robots, tactile sensors, and objects with both accuracy and unprecedented
speed, achieving an 18-fold acceleration over real-time across thousands of
parallel environments. Unlike previous simulators that operate at sub-real-time
speeds with limited parallelization, Taccel provides precise physics simulation
and realistic tactile signals while supporting flexible robot-sensor
configurations through user-friendly APIs. Through extensive validation in
object recognition, robotic grasping, and articulated object manipulation, we
demonstrate precise simulation and successful sim-to-real transfer. These
capabilities position Taccel as a powerful tool for scaling up tactile robotics
research and development. By enabling large-scale simulation and
experimentation with tactile sensing, Taccel accelerates the development of
more capable robotic systems, potentially transforming how robots interact with

Abstract: Object 6D pose estimation is a critical challenge in robotics, particularly
for manipulation tasks. While prior research combining visual and tactile
(visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle
with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In
this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation
framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone
and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on
physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations.
Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system,
where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates
repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world
robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual
backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and
bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some
drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our
experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and
60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.

Result: UniPhys在运动自然性、泛化性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniPhys能够灵活生成多样化的物理合理运动，无需任务特定微调。

Abstract: Generating natural and physically plausible character motion remains
challenging, particularly for long-horizon control with diverse guidance
signals. While prior work combines high-level diffusion-based motion planners
with low-level physics controllers, these systems suffer from domain gaps that
degrade motion quality and require task-specific fine-tuning. To tackle this
problem, we introduce UniPhys, a diffusion-based behavior cloning framework
that unifies motion planning and control into a single model. UniPhys enables
flexible, expressive character motion conditioned on multi-modal inputs such as
text, trajectories, and goals. To address accumulated prediction errors over
long sequences, UniPhys is trained with the Diffusion Forcing paradigm,
learning to denoise noisy motion histories and handle discrepancies introduced
by the physics simulator. This design allows UniPhys to robustly generate
physically plausible, long-horizon motions. Through guided sampling, UniPhys
generalizes to a wide range of control signals, including unseen ones, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments show that UniPhys outperforms
prior methods in motion naturalness, generalization, and robustness across
diverse control tasks.

TLDR: ARAP-GS是一种基于ARAP变形的拖拽驱动3D高斯溅射（3DGS）编辑框架，首次将ARAP变形直接应用于3D高斯，实现灵活编辑，并通过扩散先验保持视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法较少探索拖拽驱动编辑在3DGS中的应用，因其在变形时难以保持形状一致性和视觉连续性。

Method: 结合ARAP变形和扩散先验的迭代优化，直接对3D高斯进行变形，保持多视角一致性。

Result: 实验表明ARAP-GS在多种3D场景中优于现有方法，且高效（单GPU 10-20分钟）。

Conclusion: ARAP-GS为拖拽驱动3DGS编辑提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Drag-driven editing has become popular among designers for its ability to
modify complex geometric structures through simple and intuitive manipulation,
allowing users to adjust and reshape content with minimal technical skill. This
drag operation has been incorporated into numerous methods to facilitate the
editing of 2D images and 3D meshes in design. However, few studies have
explored drag-driven editing for the widely-used 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
representation, as deforming 3DGS while preserving shape coherence and visual
continuity remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce ARAP-GS, a
drag-driven 3DGS editing framework based on As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP)
deformation. Unlike previous 3DGS editing methods, we are the first to apply
ARAP deformation directly to 3D Gaussians, enabling flexible, drag-driven
geometric transformations. To preserve scene appearance after deformation, we
incorporate an advanced diffusion prior for image super-resolution within our
iterative optimization process. This approach enhances visual quality while
maintaining multi-view consistency in the edited results. Experiments show that
ARAP-GS outperforms current methods across diverse 3D scenes, demonstrating its
effectiveness and superiority for drag-driven 3DGS editing. Additionally, our
method is highly efficient, requiring only 10 to 20 minutes to edit a scene on
a single RTX 3090 GPU.

Result: 在公开数据集和新场景上的实验表明，该方法在效率和变形质量上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: CAGE-GS是一种灵活且高效的3DGS变形方法，适用于多种目标形状表示。

Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains popularity as a 3D representation of
real scenes, enabling user-friendly deformation to create novel scenes while
preserving fine details from the original 3DGS has attracted significant
research attention. We introduce CAGE-GS, a cage-based 3DGS deformation method
that seamlessly aligns a source 3DGS scene with a user-defined target shape.
Our approach learns a deformation cage from the target, which guides the
geometric transformation of the source scene. While the cages effectively
control structural alignment, preserving the textural appearance of 3DGS
remains challenging due to the complexity of covariance parameters. To address
this, we employ a Jacobian matrix-based strategy to update the covariance
parameters of each Gaussian, ensuring texture fidelity post-deformation. Our
method is highly flexible, accommodating various target shape representations,
including texts, images, point clouds, meshes and 3DGS models. Extensive
experiments and ablation studies on both public datasets and newly proposed
scenes demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
techniques in both efficiency and deformation quality.

Conclusion: 方法有效消除走样和伪影，实现实时无伪影渲染。

Abstract: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D reconstruction,
it still faces challenges such as aliasing, projection artifacts, and view
inconsistencies, primarily due to the simplification of treating splats as 2D
entities. We argue that incorporating full 3D evaluation of Gaussians
throughout the 3DGS pipeline can effectively address these issues while
preserving rasterization efficiency. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive 3D
smoothing filter to mitigate aliasing and present a stable view-space bounding
method that eliminates popping artifacts when Gaussians extend beyond the view
frustum. Furthermore, we promote tile-based culling to 3D with screen-space
planes, accelerating rendering and reducing sorting costs for hierarchical
rasterization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on in-distribution
evaluation sets and significantly outperforms other approaches for
out-of-distribution views. Our qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the
effective removal of aliasing, distortions, and popping artifacts, ensuring
real-time, artifact-free rendering.

Abstract: Large pretrained vision foundation models have shown significant potential in
various vision tasks. However, for industrial anomaly detection, the scarcity
of real defect samples poses a critical challenge in leveraging these models.
While 2D anomaly generation has significantly advanced with established
generative models, the adoption of 3D sensors in industrial manufacturing has
made leveraging 3D data for surface quality inspection an emerging trend. In
contrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored,
limiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address
this gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS,
based on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates
realistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane,
sampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the
point cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization
experiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale,
perturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the
generated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from
pronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our
cross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet
geometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to
their specific surface characteristics. We also provide a comprehensive
codebase and visualization toolkit to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Many works have succeeded in reconstructing Gaussian human avatars from
multi-view videos. However, they either struggle to capture pose-dependent
appearance details with a single MLP, or rely on a computationally intensive
neural network to reconstruct high-fidelity appearance but with rendering
performance degraded to non-real-time. We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar
representation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance
with details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is
empowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on
different positions on human body. The parameters stored in each Gaussian are
obtained by interpolating from the outputs of its nearby MLPs based on their
distances. To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during
interpolation, for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis, and
a linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative
to the neutral properties. Then we propose to let the MLPs output a set of
coefficients corresponding to the basis. In this way, although Gaussian
coefficients are derived from interpolation and change smoothly, the Gaussian
offset basis is learned freely without constraints. The smoothly varying
coefficients combined with freely learned basis can still produce distinctly
different Gaussian property offsets, allowing the ability to learn
high-frequency spatial signals. We further use control points to constrain the
Gaussians distributed on a surface layer rather than allowing them to be
irregularly distributed inside the body, to help the human avatar generalize
better when animated under novel poses. Compared to the state-of-the-art
method, our method achieves better appearance quality with finer details while
the rendering speed is significantly faster under novel views and novel poses.

Abstract: Photorealistic avatars have become essential for immersive applications in
virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), enabling lifelike interactions
in areas such as training simulations, telemedicine, and virtual collaboration.
These avatars bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds, improving
the user experience through realistic human representation. However, existing
avatar creation techniques face significant challenges, including high costs,
long creation times, and limited utility in virtual applications. Manual
methods, such as MetaHuman, require extensive time and expertise, while
automatic approaches, such as NeRF-based pipelines often lack efficiency,
detailed facial expression fidelity, and are unable to be rendered at a speed
sufficent for real-time applications. By involving several cutting-edge modern
techniques, we introduce an end-to-end 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) avatar
creation pipeline that leverages monocular video input to create a scalable and
efficient photorealistic avatar directly compatible with the Unity game engine.
Our pipeline incorporates a novel Gaussian splatting technique with customized
preprocessing that enables the user of "in the wild" monocular video capture,
detailed facial expression reconstruction and embedding within a fully rigged
avatar model. Additionally, we present a Unity-integrated Gaussian Splatting
Avatar Editor, offering a user-friendly environment for VR/AR application
development. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
preprocessing pipeline in standardizing custom data for 3DGS training and
demonstrate the versatility of Gaussian avatars in Unity, highlighting the

Motivation: 高斯泼溅在3D场景建模中表现优异，但数据量庞大，难以在现有互联网基础设施上传输，因此需要高效的压缩方法。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，CompGS++显著优于现有方法，实现了高效压缩和精确建模。

Conclusion: CompGS++为未来逼真的3D沉浸式视觉通信应用提供了高效的数据压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting demonstrates proficiency for 3D scene modeling but suffers
from substantial data volume due to inherent primitive redundancy. To enable
future photorealistic 3D immersive visual communication applications,
significant compression is essential for transmission over the existing
Internet infrastructure. Hence, we propose Compressed Gaussian Splatting
(CompGS++), a novel framework that leverages compact Gaussian primitives to
achieve accurate 3D modeling with substantial size reduction for both static
and dynamic scenes. Our design is based on the principle of eliminating
redundancy both between and within primitives. Specifically, we develop a
comprehensive prediction paradigm to address inter-primitive redundancy through
spatial and temporal primitive prediction modules. The spatial primitive
prediction module establishes predictive relationships for scene primitives and
enables most primitives to be encoded as compact residuals, substantially
reducing the spatial redundancy. We further devise a temporal primitive
prediction module to handle dynamic scenes, which exploits primitive
correlations across timestamps to effectively reduce temporal redundancy.
Moreover, we devise a rate-constrained optimization module that jointly
minimizes reconstruction error and rate consumption. This module effectively
eliminates parameter redundancy within primitives and enhances the overall
compactness of scene representations. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that CompGS++ significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior compression performance while preserving accurate
scene modeling. Our implementation will be made publicly available on GitHub to
facilitate further research.

Conclusion: HiScene为交互式3D场景生成提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Scene-level 3D generation represents a critical frontier in multimedia and
computer graphics, yet existing approaches either suffer from limited object
categories or lack editing flexibility for interactive applications. In this
paper, we present HiScene, a novel hierarchical framework that bridges the gap
between 2D image generation and 3D object generation and delivers high-fidelity
scenes with compositional identities and aesthetic scene content. Our key
insight is treating scenes as hierarchical "objects" under isometric views,
where a room functions as a complex object that can be further decomposed into
manipulatable items. This hierarchical approach enables us to generate 3D
content that aligns with 2D representations while maintaining compositional
structure. To ensure completeness and spatial alignment of each decomposed
instance, we develop a video-diffusion-based amodal completion technique that
effectively handles occlusions and shadows between objects, and introduce shape
prior injection to ensure spatial coherence within the scene. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method produces more natural object arrangements
and complete object instances suitable for interactive applications, while
maintaining physical plausibility and alignment with user inputs.

Conclusion: Regist3R展示了在大规模3D重建任务（如城市建模和航空测绘）中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction has remained an essential yet challenging
problem in the field of computer vision. While DUSt3R and its successors have
achieved breakthroughs in 3D reconstruction from unposed images, these methods
exhibit significant limitations when scaling to multi-view scenarios, including
high computational cost and cumulative error induced by global alignment. To
address these challenges, we propose Regist3R, a novel stereo foundation model
tailored for efficient and scalable incremental reconstruction. Regist3R
leverages an incremental reconstruction paradigm, enabling large-scale 3D
reconstructions from unordered and many-view image collections. We evaluate
Regist3R on public datasets for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction.
Our experiments demonstrate that Regist3R achieves comparable performance with
optimization-based methods while significantly improving computational
efficiency, and outperforms existing multi-view reconstruction models.
Furthermore, to assess its performance in real-world applications, we introduce
a challenging oblique aerial dataset which has long spatial spans and hundreds
of views. The results highlight the effectiveness of Regist3R. We also
demonstrate the first attempt to reconstruct large-scale scenes encompassing
over thousands of views through pointmap-based foundation models, showcasing
its potential for practical applications in large-scale 3D reconstruction
tasks, including urban modeling, aerial mapping, and beyond.

Result: 在UPENN-GBM数据集上，自编码器的MSE为0.0016；在MoNuSeg数据集上，核分割的F1得分为77.46%，Jaccard得分为63.35%。

Conclusion: TUMLS显著提升了数字病理学的工作流程效率和透明度，展示了其在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: Digital pathology, augmented by artificial intelligence (AI), holds
significant promise for improving the workflow of pathologists. However,
challenges such as the labor-intensive annotation of whole slide images (WSIs),
high computational demands, and trust concerns arising from the absence of
uncertainty estimation in predictions hinder the practical application of
current AI methodologies in histopathology. To address these issues, we present
a novel trustful fully unsupervised multi-level segmentation methodology
(TUMLS) for WSIs. TUMLS adopts an autoencoder (AE) as a feature extractor to
identify the different tissue types within low-resolution training data. It
selects representative patches from each identified group based on an
uncertainty measure and then does unsupervised nuclei segmentation in their
respective higher-resolution space without using any ML algorithms. Crucially,
this solution integrates seamlessly into clinicians workflows, transforming the
examination of a whole WSI into a review of concise, interpretable cross-level
insights. This integration significantly enhances and accelerates the workflow
while ensuring transparency. We evaluated our approach using the UPENN-GBM
dataset, where the AE achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0016.
Additionally, nucleus segmentation is assessed on the MoNuSeg dataset,
outperforming all unsupervised approaches with an F1 score of 77.46% and a
Jaccard score of 63.35%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of TUMLS in
advancing the field of digital pathology.

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: ViTa是一种基础模型，通过整合心脏磁共振成像（CMR）和患者层面的健康因素，提供全面的心脏健康评估和疾病风险预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMR虽是非侵入性心脏评估的金标准，但缺乏患者层面的健康因素（如人口统计、代谢和生活方式），这些因素对心血管健康和疾病风险有重要影响。

Method: ViTa利用42,000名UK Biobank参与者的数据，整合3D+T cine成像和患者层面因素，通过多模态学习生成共享潜在表征。

Result: ViTa支持多种下游任务，包括心脏表型预测、分割和分类，提供全面的心脏健康评估。

Conclusion: ViTa通过整合多模态数据，实现了对心脏健康的全面理解，具有临床实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive
cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy
and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic,
and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and
disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand
cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an
individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly
exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have
begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data
and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a
comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a
comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of
individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants,
ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling
a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with
detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This
multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including
cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and
classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified
framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging
features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific
models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health,
highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in
cardiac analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents a review for the NTIRE 2025 Challenge on Short-form UGC
Video Quality Assessment and Enhancement. The challenge comprises two tracks:
(i) Efficient Video Quality Assessment (KVQ), and (ii) Diffusion-based Image
Super-Resolution (KwaiSR). Track 1 aims to advance the development of
lightweight and efficient video quality assessment (VQA) models, with an
emphasis on eliminating reliance on model ensembles, redundant weights, and
other computationally expensive components in the previous IQA/VQA
competitions. Track 2 introduces a new short-form UGC dataset tailored for
single image super-resolution, i.e., the KwaiSR dataset. It consists of 1,800
synthetically generated S-UGC image pairs and 1,900 real-world S-UGC images,
which are split into training, validation, and test sets using a ratio of
8:1:1. The primary objective of the challenge is to drive research that
benefits the user experience of short-form UGC platforms such as Kwai and
TikTok. This challenge attracted 266 participants and received 18 valid final
submissions with corresponding fact sheets, significantly contributing to the
progress of short-form UGC VQA and image superresolution. The project is
publicly available at https://github.com/lixinustc/KVQE-

### [223] [A Phenomenological Approach to Analyzing User Queries in IT Systems Using Heidegger's Fundamental Ontology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12977)
*Maksim Vishnevskiy*

Main category: cs.SE

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于海德格尔基础本体论的新型IT分析系统，通过两种模态语言（存在者语言和存在语言）及其桥梁模块，实现深层本体模式分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统局限于范畴分析，无法处理深层本体问题，如隐喻等逻辑陷阱。

Method: 系统使用两种语言（存在者语言和存在语言），通过现象学还原模块连接，分析用户查询并识别递归和自指结构。

Result: 系统能提供可操作的范畴分析结果，并在真实IT专家对话案例中验证了其优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用查询分析工具奠定了基础，但仍需进一步形式化存在语言以实现完全可计算性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel research analytical IT system grounded in Martin
Heidegger's Fundamental Ontology, distinguishing between beings (das Seiende)
and Being (das Sein). The system employs two modally distinct, descriptively
complete languages: a categorical language of beings for processing user inputs
and an existential language of Being for internal analysis. These languages are
bridged via a phenomenological reduction module, enabling the system to analyze
user queries (including questions, answers, and dialogues among IT
specialists), identify recursive and self-referential structures, and provide
actionable insights in categorical terms. Unlike contemporary systems limited
to categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger's phenomenological
existential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query
processing, aiding in resolving logical traps in complex interactions, such as
metaphor usage in IT contexts. The path to full realization involves
formalizing the language of Being by a research team based on Heidegger's
Fundamental Ontology; given the existing completeness of the language of
beings, this reduces the system's computability to completeness, paving the way
for a universal query analysis tool. The paper presents the system's
architecture, operational principles, technical implementation, use
cases--including a case based on real IT specialist dialogues--comparative
evaluation with existing tools, and its advantages and limitations.

Main category: cs.HC

TLDR: MobilePoser是一种实时系统，利用消费设备中现有的IMU子集进行全身姿态和全局平移估计，解决了传感器噪声和漂移带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着运动捕捉技术向低精度IMU迁移，如手机、手表和耳机等设备，出现了在线性能、时间一致性和全局平移丢失等问题。

Method: 采用多阶段深度神经网络进行运动姿态估计，并结合基于物理的运动优化器。

Result: 实现了最先进的精度，同时保持轻量级。

Conclusion: MobilePoser在健康、游戏和室内导航等多个领域展示了独特潜力。

Abstract: There has been a continued trend towards minimizing instrumentation for
full-body motion capture, going from specialized rooms and equipment, to arrays
of worn sensors and recently sparse inertial pose capture methods. However, as
these techniques migrate towards lower-fidelity IMUs on ubiquitous commodity
devices, like phones, watches, and earbuds, challenges arise including
compromised online performance, temporal consistency, and loss of global
translation due to sensor noise and drift. Addressing these challenges, we
introduce MobilePoser, a real-time system for full-body pose and global
translation estimation using any available subset of IMUs already present in
these consumer devices. MobilePoser employs a multi-stage deep neural network
for kinematic pose estimation followed by a physics-based motion optimizer,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while remaining lightweight. We conclude
with a series of demonstrative applications to illustrate the unique potential
of MobilePoser across a variety of fields, such as health and wellness, gaming,
and indoor navigation to name a few.

Conclusion: 该框架为评估MLLMs作为认知助手的实用性提供了新方法，有助于推动其在HCI和认知科学中的发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we advance the study of AI-augmented reasoning in the context
of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), psychology and cognitive science, focusing
on the critical task of visual perception. Specifically, we investigate the
applicability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain. To
this end, we leverage established principles and explanations from psychology
and cognitive science related to complexity in human visual perception. We use
them as guiding principles for the MLLMs to compare and interprete visual
content. Our study aims to benchmark MLLMs across various explainability
principles relevant to visual perception. Unlike recent approaches that
primarily employ advanced deep learning models to predict complexity metrics
from visual content, our work does not seek to develop a mere new predictive
model. Instead, we propose a novel annotation-free analytical framework to
assess utility of MLLMs as cognitive assistants for HCI tasks, using visual
perception as a case study. The primary goal is to pave the way for principled
study in quantifying and evaluating the interpretability of MLLMs for
applications in improving human reasoning capability and uncovering biases in
existing perception datasets annotated by humans.
