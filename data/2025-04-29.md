### [1] [Mind the Language Gap: Automated and Augmented Evaluation of Bias in LLMs for High- and Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18560)
*Alessio Buscemi,Cédric Lothritz,Sergio Morales,Marcos Gomez-Vazquez,Robert Clarisó,Jordi Cabot,German Castignani*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: MLA-BiTe框架通过多语言增强偏见测试，改进了现有偏见评估方法，支持跨语言的系统性偏见测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理中表现出色，但常延续训练数据中的社会偏见，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: MLA-BiTe利用自动翻译和改写技术，在六种语言（包括两种低资源语言）中对四种先进LLMs进行测试，涵盖七类敏感歧视问题。

Result: MLA-BiTe能够系统性地评估LLMs在多语言环境中的偏见表现。

Conclusion: MLA-BiTe为多语言偏见测试提供了有效工具，有助于更全面地识别和减少LLMs中的社会偏见。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive natural language
processing capabilities but often perpetuate social biases inherent in their
training data. To address this, we introduce MultiLingual Augmented Bias
Testing (MLA-BiTe), a framework that improves prior bias evaluation methods by
enabling systematic multilingual bias testing. MLA-BiTe leverages automated
translation and paraphrasing techniques to support comprehensive assessments
across diverse linguistic settings. In this study, we evaluate the
effectiveness of MLA-BiTe by testing four state-of-the-art LLMs in six
languages -- including two low-resource languages -- focusing on seven
sensitive categories of discrimination.

### [2] [Span-Level Hallucination Detection for LLM-Generated Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18639)
*Passant Elchafei,Mervet Abu-Elkheir*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于语义角色标注（SRL）和文本蕴含模型的跨度级幻觉检测框架，用于检测LLM生成答案中的幻觉内容，并在Mu-SHROOM数据集上验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测LLM生成答案中的幻觉跨度对提高事实一致性至关重要。

Method: 结合语义角色标注（SRL）将答案分解为原子角色，通过基于问题的LLM提示获取参考上下文，并使用DeBERTa文本蕴含模型评估语义对齐。通过输出logits的置信度进一步优化得分，检测幻觉跨度。

Result: 在Mu-SHROOM数据集上表现出竞争力，并通过GPT-4和LLaMA验证了幻觉跨度的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为改进LLM生成答案中的幻觉检测提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Detecting spans of hallucination in LLM-generated answers is crucial for
improving factual consistency. This paper presents a span-level hallucination
detection framework for the SemEval-2025 Shared Task, focusing on English and
Arabic texts. Our approach integrates Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) to decompose
the answer into atomic roles, which are then compared with a retrieved
reference context obtained via question-based LLM prompting. Using a
DeBERTa-based textual entailment model, we evaluate each role semantic
alignment with the retrieved context. The entailment scores are further refined
through token-level confidence measures derived from output logits, and the
combined scores are used to detect hallucinated spans. Experiments on the
Mu-SHROOM dataset demonstrate competitive performance. Additionally,
hallucinated spans have been verified through fact-checking by prompting GPT-4
and LLaMA. Our findings contribute to improving hallucination detection in
LLM-generated responses.

### [3] [Can Third-parties Read Our Emotions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18673)
*Jiayi Li,Yingfan Zhou,Pranav Narayanan Venkit,Halima Binte Islam,Sneha Arya,Shomir Wilson,Sarah Rajtmajer*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究比较了第三方标注与作者自标在情感识别任务中的表现，发现第三方标注（包括人工和LLMs）在准确捕捉作者真实情感上存在显著局限，但LLMs表现优于人工标注。通过提升标注者与作者的相似性或加入作者信息可改善标注质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证第三方标注是否能准确捕捉作者的真实情感状态。

Method: 通过实验比较第三方标注（人工和LLMs）与作者自标在情感识别任务中的表现，并探索提升标注质量的方法。

Result: 第三方标注在反映作者真实情感上存在局限，但LLMs表现优于人工标注；标注者与作者相似性可提升标注质量。

Conclusion: 需改进标注实践以更准确反映作者真实情感状态，并提出了评估框架。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing tasks that aim to infer an author's private
states, e.g., emotions and opinions, from their written text, typically rely on
datasets annotated by third-party annotators. However, the assumption that
third-party annotators can accurately capture authors' private states remains
largely unexamined. In this study, we present human subjects experiments on
emotion recognition tasks that directly compare third-party annotations with
first-party (author-provided) emotion labels. Our findings reveal significant
limitations in third-party annotations-whether provided by human annotators or
large language models (LLMs)-in faithfully representing authors' private
states. However, LLMs outperform human annotators nearly across the board. We
further explore methods to improve third-party annotation quality. We find that
demographic similarity between first-party authors and third-party human
annotators enhances annotation performance. While incorporating first-party
demographic information into prompts leads to a marginal but statistically
significant improvement in LLMs' performance. We introduce a framework for
evaluating the limitations of third-party annotations and call for refined
annotation practices to accurately represent and model authors' private states.

### [4] [Spatial Speech Translation: Translating Across Space With Binaural Hearables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18715)
*Tuochao Chen,Qirui Wang,Runlin He,Shyam Gollakota*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种新型的空间语音翻译技术，通过头戴设备实时翻译多语言环境中的语音，并保留说话者的空间位置和声音特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在多语言嘈杂环境中，传统翻译技术无法保留说话者空间位置和声音特征的问题。

Method: 结合盲源分离、定位、实时表达性翻译和双耳渲染技术，实现实时翻译并保留空间线索。

Result: 在Apple M2芯片上实现实时推理，BLEU得分达22.01，用户研究证实其在真实环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 首次将空间感知融入语音翻译，为未来技术发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Imagine being in a crowded space where people speak a different language and
having hearables that transform the auditory space into your native language,
while preserving the spatial cues for all speakers. We introduce spatial speech
translation, a novel concept for hearables that translate speakers in the
wearer's environment, while maintaining the direction and unique voice
characteristics of each speaker in the binaural output. To achieve this, we
tackle several technical challenges spanning blind source separation,
localization, real-time expressive translation, and binaural rendering to
preserve the speaker directions in the translated audio, while achieving
real-time inference on the Apple M2 silicon. Our proof-of-concept evaluation
with a prototype binaural headset shows that, unlike existing models, which
fail in the presence of interference, we achieve a BLEU score of up to 22.01
when translating between languages, despite strong interference from other
speakers in the environment. User studies further confirm the system's
effectiveness in spatially rendering the translated speech in previously unseen
real-world reverberant environments. Taking a step back, this work marks the
first step towards integrating spatial perception into speech translation.

### [5] [Building UD Cairo for Old English in the Classroom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18718)
*Lauren Levine,Junghyun Min,Amir Zeldes*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文介绍了基于UD Cairo句子的古英语样本树库，通过LLM提示和真实古英语数据收集，学生标注后比较修正。结果表明LLM输出需后编辑，初学者标注虽不完美但集体效果良好，现代英语训练数据解析古英语效果差但标注特征可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为古英语构建样本树库，探索LLM和初学者标注在古英语数据处理中的潜力。

Method: 结合LLM提示和真实古英语数据收集20个句子，由初学者标注后比较修正，并尝试用现代英语训练数据解析古英语。

Result: LLM输出需后编辑以接近真实语法，初学者集体标注效果良好，标注特征（如lemma）可提升解析性能。

Conclusion: LLM和初学者标注在古英语数据处理中具有潜力，但需进一步优化标注和解析方法。

Abstract: In this paper we present a sample treebank for Old English based on the UD
Cairo sentences, collected and annotated as part of a classroom curriculum in
Historical Linguistics. To collect the data, a sample of 20 sentences
illustrating a range of syntactic constructions in the world's languages, we
employ a combination of LLM prompting and searches in authentic Old English
data. For annotation we assigned sentences to multiple students with limited
prior exposure to UD, whose annotations we compare and adjudicate. Our results
suggest that while current LLM outputs in Old English do not reflect authentic
syntax, this can be mitigated by post-editing, and that although beginner
annotators do not possess enough background to complete the task perfectly,
taken together they can produce good results and learn from the experience. We
also conduct preliminary parsing experiments using Modern English training
data, and find that although performance on Old English is poor, parsing on
annotated features (lemma, hyperlemma, gloss) leads to improved performance.

### [6] [EvidenceBench: A Benchmark for Extracting Evidence from Biomedical Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18736)
*Jianyou Wang,Weili Cao,Kaicheng Wang,Xiaoyue Wang,Ashish Dalvi,Gino Prasad,Qishan Liang,Hsuan-lin Her,Ming Wang,Qin Yang,Gene W. Yeo,David E. Neal,Maxim Khan,Christopher D. Rosin,Ramamohan Paturi,Leon Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种自动寻找生物医学论文中与假设相关证据的任务，并引入了EvidenceBench作为评估模型性能的基准，通过专家标注验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者在验证科学假设时需要寻找相关证据，但目前缺乏有效的自动化工具和评估标准。

Method: 提出了一种由假设生成和逐句标注组成的新流程，完全基于专家判断，并构建了EvidenceBench数据集。

Result: 评估了多种语言模型和检索系统，发现其性能远低于专家水平。同时扩展了数据集EvidenceBench-100k，包含10万篇标注论文。

Conclusion: EvidenceBench为模型训练和开发提供了有效工具，但现有模型仍需大幅改进才能达到专家水平。

Abstract: We study the task of automatically finding evidence relevant to hypotheses in
biomedical papers. Finding relevant evidence is an important step when
researchers investigate scientific hypotheses. We introduce EvidenceBench to
measure models performance on this task, which is created by a novel pipeline
that consists of hypothesis generation and sentence-by-sentence annotation of
biomedical papers for relevant evidence, completely guided by and faithfully
following existing human experts judgment. We demonstrate the pipeline's
validity and accuracy with multiple sets of human-expert annotations. We
evaluated a diverse set of language models and retrieval systems on the
benchmark and found that model performances still fall significantly short of
the expert level on this task. To show the scalability of our proposed
pipeline, we create a larger EvidenceBench-100k with 107,461 fully annotated
papers with hypotheses to facilitate model training and development. Both
datasets are available at https://github.com/EvidenceBench/EvidenceBench

TLDR: SynLexLM是一种新颖的法律大语言模型预训练方法，通过课程学习和合成数据增强解决法律数据稀缺问题，旨在提升法律基准测试性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用预训练难以捕捉法律领域的细微差别，且获取足够法律数据具有挑战性。

Method: 采用课程学习（从简单到复杂的法律文本和查询）和合成数据增强（如使用Gemini Pro生成合成QA对）。

Result: 预期在法律基准测试（BigLaw-Bench, EUR-Lex-Sum）上优于传统模型和微调版本。

Conclusion: SynLexLM有望提升法律文档分析和研究工具，推动法律AI的普及。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often require extensive
fine-tuning and large datasets for specialized domains like law.
General-purpose pre-training may not capture legal nuances, and acquiring
sufficient legal data is challenging. We introduce SynLexLM, a novel approach
to efficiently pre-train a legal LLM. Our method employs curriculum learning,
progressing from simple to complex legal texts and queries, combined with
synthetic data augmentation using models like Gemini Pro to address data
scarcity. We aim to achieve improved performance on legal benchmarks
(BigLaw-Bench, EUR-Lex-Sum) compared to traditional models and fine-tuned
versions. Preliminary work involves generating synthetic QA pairs reflecting
legal reasoning. This work aims to enhance legal document analysis and research
tools, potentially democratizing access to advanced legal AI.

### [8] [Stealing Creator's Workflow: A Creator-Inspired Agentic Framework with Iterative Feedback Loop for Improved Scientific Short-form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18805)
*Jong Inn Park,Maanas Taneja,Qianwen Wang,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: SciTalk是一个多LLM代理框架，用于从科学论文生成准确且吸引人的短视频，通过迭代反馈机制优化生成内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有端到端方法在科学传播中因内容复杂性和专家与读者之间的差距导致的事实不准确和视觉伪影问题。

Method: 提出SciTalk框架，利用多代理分工（内容总结、视觉场景规划、文本和布局编辑）和迭代反馈机制优化视频生成。

Result: 实验表明，SciTalk在生成科学准确且吸引人的内容方面优于简单提示方法，但仍未达到人类创作者的质量。

Conclusion: SciTalk为反馈驱动视频生成的挑战和优势提供了有价值的见解，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Generating engaging, accurate short-form videos from scientific papers is
challenging due to content complexity and the gap between expert authors and
readers. Existing end-to-end methods often suffer from factual inaccuracies and
visual artifacts, limiting their utility for scientific dissemination. To
address these issues, we propose SciTalk, a novel multi-LLM agentic framework,
grounding videos in various sources, such as text, figures, visual styles, and
avatars. Inspired by content creators' workflows, SciTalk uses specialized
agents for content summarization, visual scene planning, and text and layout
editing, and incorporates an iterative feedback mechanism where video agents
simulate user roles to give feedback on generated videos from previous
iterations and refine generation prompts. Experimental evaluations show that
SciTalk outperforms simple prompting methods in generating scientifically
accurate and engaging content over the refined loop of video generation.
Although preliminary results are still not yet matching human creators'
quality, our framework provides valuable insights into the challenges and
benefits of feedback-driven video generation. Our code, data, and generated
videos will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的快速发展，传统评估方法已无法满足需求，需要重新设计评估框架以适应其能力的扩展。

Method: 分析了两大转变：能力评估和自动化评估，并从方法、数据集、评估者和指标的角度探讨了核心挑战。

Result: 提出了评估泛化问题，并指出现有测试集无法跟上模型能力的增长。

Conclusion: 通过GitHub仓库持续更新，邀请社区共同解决评估挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing at an amazing speed and have
become indispensable across academia, industry, and daily applications. To keep
pace with the status quo, this survey probes the core challenges that the rise
of LLMs poses for evaluation. We identify and analyze two pivotal transitions:
(i) from task-specific to capability-based evaluation, which reorganizes
benchmarks around core competencies such as knowledge, reasoning, instruction
following, multi-modal understanding, and safety; and (ii) from manual to
automated evaluation, encompassing dynamic dataset curation and
"LLM-as-a-judge" scoring.
  Yet, even with these transitions, a crucial obstacle persists: the evaluation
generalization issue. Bounded test sets cannot scale alongside models whose
abilities grow seemingly without limit. We will dissect this issue, along with
the core challenges of the above two transitions, from the perspectives of
methods, datasets, evaluators, and metrics. Due to the fast evolving of this
field, we will maintain a living GitHub repository (links are in each section)
to crowd-source updates and corrections, and warmly invite contributors and
collaborators.

### [10] [Towards Robust Dialogue Breakdown Detection: Addressing Disruptors in Large Language Models with Self-Guided Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18839)
*Abdellah Ghassel,Xianzhi Li,Xiaodan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种结合微调和高级提示策略的方法，用于检测和缓解LLM驱动的对话系统中的对话崩溃问题，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在许多对话任务中表现出色，但仍可能产生不连贯或矛盾的响应（崩溃），影响用户信任。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合微调（8B模型）和高级提示策略（少样本学习、思维链推理、类比提示），并验证其在英语和日语对话中的分类与校准能力。

Result: 在BETOLD数据集上实现了7%的准确率提升，实时部署架构显著降低了运营成本和能耗。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了效率、可解释性和可靠性，为高影响领域的稳健对话AI提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly changing various domains. However,
their capabilities in handling conversational breakdowns still require an
in-depth exploration. This paper addresses the challenge of detecting and
mitigating dialogue breakdowns within LLM-driven conversational systems. While
powerful models from OpenAI and Anthropic excel in many dialogue tasks, they
can still produce incoherent or contradictory responses, commonly referred to
as breakdowns, which undermine user trust. To tackle this, we propose an
approach that combines specialized fine-tuning with advanced prompting
strategies, including few-shot learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and
analogical prompting. In particular, we fine-tune a small 8B model and
demonstrate its robust classification and calibration capabilities in English
and Japanese dialogue. We also validate its generalization on the BETOLD
dataset, achieving a 7\% accuracy improvement over its base model. Furthermore,
we introduce a real-time deployment architecture that selectively escalates
suspicious responses to more resource-intensive frontier models only when
breakdowns are detected, significantly cutting operational expenses and energy
consumption. Experimental results show our method surpasses prior
state-of-the-art specialized classifiers while also narrowing performance gaps
between smaller open-source models and large proprietary ones. Our approach
offers a scalable solution for robust conversational AI in high-impact domains
by combining efficiency, interpretability, and reliability.

### [11] [When2Call: When (not) to Call Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18851)
*Hayley Ross,Ameya Sunil Mahabaleshwarkar,Yoshi Suhara*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一个新的基准测试When2Call，用于评估语言模型在工具调用决策中的表现，包括何时调用工具、何时提问或承认无法回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注工具调用的准确性，而忽略了评估模型何时应该（或不应该）调用工具的重要性。

Method: 开发了When2Call基准测试和训练集，并利用其多选特性设计了偏好优化训练方法。

Result: 当前最先进的工具调用语言模型在When2Call上表现不佳，表明其重要性；偏好优化训练方法显著优于传统微调。

Conclusion: When2Call为工具调用决策提供了新的评估标准，并展示了偏好优化训练的有效性。

Abstract: Leveraging external tools is a key feature for modern Language Models (LMs)
to expand their capabilities and integrate them into existing systems. However,
existing benchmarks primarily focus on the accuracy of tool calling -- whether
the correct tool is called with the correct parameters -- and less on
evaluating when LMs should (not) call tools. We develop a new benchmark,
When2Call, which evaluates tool-calling decision-making: when to generate a
tool call, when to ask follow-up questions and when to admit the question can't
be answered with the tools provided. We find that state-of-the-art tool-calling
LMs show significant room for improvement on When2Call, indicating the
importance of this benchmark. We also develop a training set for When2Call and
leverage the multiple-choice nature of the benchmark to develop a preference
optimization training regime, which shows considerably more improvement than
traditional fine-tuning. We release the benchmark and training data as well as
evaluation scripts at https://github.com/NVIDIA/When2Call.

### [12] [Effective Length Extrapolation via Dimension-Wise Positional Embeddings Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18857)
*Yi Lu,Wanxu Zhao,Xin Zhou,Chenxin An,Chenglong Wang,Shuo Li,Yuming Yang,Jun Zhao,Tao Ji,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种无需训练的框架DPE，通过调整RoPE的隐藏维度来扩展LLMs的上下文窗口，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在处理超长上下文时的性能问题，避免昂贵的再训练开销。

Method: 通过分析RoPE的不同隐藏维度，检测关键维度并调整其位置索引，实现上下文窗口的扩展。

Result: DPE显著提升了模型性能，如Llama3-8k 8B支持128k上下文，Llama3.1 70B性能提升18点。

Conclusion: DPE是一种高效且无需训练的方法，显著扩展了LLMs的上下文处理能力，性能优于商业模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to process and generate coherent
context when the number of input tokens exceeds the pre-trained length. Recent
advancements in long-context extension have significantly expanded the context
window of LLMs but require expensive overhead to train the large-scale models
with longer context. In this work, we propose Dimension-Wise Positional
Embeddings Manipulation (DPE), a training-free framework to extrapolate the
context window of LLMs by diving into RoPE's different hidden dimensions.
Instead of manipulating all dimensions equally, DPE detects the effective
length for every dimension and finds the key dimensions for context extension.
We reuse the original position indices with their embeddings from the
pre-trained model and manipulate the key dimensions' position indices to their
most effective lengths. In this way, DPE adjusts the pre-trained models with
minimal modifications while ensuring that each dimension reaches its optimal
state for extrapolation. DPE significantly surpasses well-known baselines such
as YaRN and Self-Extend. DPE enables Llama3-8k 8B to support context windows of
128k tokens without continual training and integrates seamlessly with Flash
Attention 2. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DPE also
dramatically improves the models' performance within training length, such as
Llama3.1 70B, by over 18 points on popular long-context benchmarks RULER. When
compared with commercial models, Llama 3.1 70B with DPE even achieves better
performance than GPT-4-128K.

### [13] [Latent Adversarial Training Improves the Representation of Refusal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18872)
*Alexandra Abbas,Nora Petrova,Helios Ael Lyons,Natalia Perez-Campanero*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究发现语言模型的拒绝行为主要编码在潜在空间的单一方向上，易受攻击。LAT通过训练引入噪声改善鲁棒性，但改变了拒绝行为的表示，集中在SVD前两个成分中，提高了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LAT如何改变拒绝行为的潜在空间表示，以评估其有效性和局限性。

Method: 分析Llama 2 7B，比较LAT、SSFT和AT对拒绝行为表示的影响，使用SVD分解激活差异。

Result: LAT显著改变拒绝表示，集中在SVD前两个成分（占75%方差），提高了攻击效果和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LAT的训练扰动能更全面地表示拒绝行为，但也暴露了潜在弱点，对模型安全性改进有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models' refusal behavior is primarily
encoded in a single direction in their latent space, making it vulnerable to
targeted attacks. Although Latent Adversarial Training (LAT) attempts to
improve robustness by introducing noise during training, a key question
remains: How does this noise-based training affect the underlying
representation of refusal behavior? Understanding this encoding is crucial for
evaluating LAT's effectiveness and limitations, just as the discovery of linear
refusal directions revealed vulnerabilities in traditional supervised safety
fine-tuning (SSFT).
  Through the analysis of Llama 2 7B, we examine how LAT reorganizes the
refusal behavior in the model's latent space compared to SSFT and embedding
space adversarial training (AT). By computing activation differences between
harmful and harmless instruction pairs and applying Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD), we find that LAT significantly alters the refusal
representation, concentrating it in the first two SVD components which explain
approximately 75 percent of the activation differences variance - significantly
higher than in reference models. This concentrated representation leads to more
effective and transferable refusal vectors for ablation attacks: LAT models
show improved robustness when attacked with vectors from reference models but
become more vulnerable to self-generated vectors compared to SSFT and AT. Our
findings suggest that LAT's training perturbations enable a more comprehensive
representation of refusal behavior, highlighting both its potential strengths
and vulnerabilities for improving model safety.

### [14] [A Simple Ensemble Strategy for LLM Inference: Towards More Stable Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18884)
*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 通过集成多个中型LLM的推理结果，提升情感分析的鲁棒性和准确性，相比单一大型模型，RMSE降低了18.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献忽视了LLM结果的变异性与可重复性问题，而实际人类标注通过多数投票解决分歧。

Method: 采用简单的集成策略，结合多个中型LLM的推理结果进行情感分析。

Result: 集成方法比单一大型模型的单次尝试更鲁棒和准确，RMSE降低了18.6%。

Conclusion: 集成中型LLM的多次推理是一种有效提升情感分析性能的策略。

Abstract: With the advance of large language models (LLMs), LLMs have been utilized for
the various tasks. However, the issues of variability and reproducibility of
results from each trial of LLMs have been largely overlooked in existing
literature while actual human annotation uses majority voting to resolve
disagreements among annotators. Therefore, this study introduces the
straightforward ensemble strategy to a sentiment analysis using LLMs. As the
results, we demonstrate that the ensemble of multiple inference using
medium-sized LLMs produces more robust and accurate results than using a large
model with a single attempt with reducing RMSE by 18.6%.

### [15] [MTCSC: Retrieval-Augmented Iterative Refinement for Chinese Spelling Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18938)
*Junhong Liang,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于RAG的多轮中文拼写纠错框架MTCSC，解决了传统方法在长度一致性和领域适应性上的限制，显著提升了纠错质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统中文拼写纠错（CSC）方法要求输入输出长度一致，且难以适应领域特定纠错需求，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 提出MTCSC框架，结合RAG和长度反射机制，构建领域特定检索数据库，并采用多源组合策略和迭代长度反射确保输出长度一致性。

Result: 实验表明，MTCSC在多样领域数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在领域特定和变长纠错任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: MTCSC框架有效扩展了CSC的应用场景，提升了纠错质量，尤其在领域适应性和长度一致性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) aims to detect and correct erroneous tokens
in sentences. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success
in identifying and rectifying potential errors, they often struggle with
maintaining consistent output lengths and adapting to domain-specific
corrections. Furthermore, existing CSC task impose rigid constraints requiring
input and output lengths to be identical, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we extend traditional CSC to variable-length correction scenarios,
including Chinese Splitting Error Correction (CSEC) and ASR N-best Error
Correction. To address domain adaptation and length consistency, we propose
MTCSC (Multi-Turn CSC) framework based on RAG enhanced with a length reflection
mechanism. Our approach constructs a retrieval database from domain-specific
training data and dictionaries, fine-tuning retrievers to optimize performance
for error-containing inputs. Additionally, we introduce a multi-source
combination strategy with iterative length reflection to ensure output length
fidelity. Experiments across diverse domain datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms current approaches in correction quality,
particularly in handling domain-specific and variable-length error correction

TLDR: 论文介绍了LawFlow数据集，用于捕捉法律实践中端到端的动态推理过程，比较了人类与LLM生成的工作流差异，并提出了AI支持法律工作的设计建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在法律领域的应用局限于孤立子任务，无法支持复杂的端到端法律决策。LawFlow旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 收集法律学生完成的端到端法律工作流数据，对比人类与LLM生成的工作流结构、推理灵活性和执行差异。

Result: 人类工作流更具模块化和适应性，而LLM工作流更线性且缺乏对下游影响的敏感性。法律专业人士更倾向于AI在支持性角色中发挥作用。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在复杂法律工作流中的局限性，并提出了协作式、推理感知的法律AI系统设计方向。

Abstract: Legal practitioners, particularly those early in their careers, face complex,
high-stakes tasks that require adaptive, context-sensitive reasoning. While AI
holds promise in supporting legal work, current datasets and models are
narrowly focused on isolated subtasks and fail to capture the end-to-end
decision-making required in real-world practice. To address this gap, we
introduce LawFlow, a dataset of complete end-to-end legal workflows collected
from trained law students, grounded in real-world business entity formation
scenarios. Unlike prior datasets focused on input-output pairs or linear chains
of thought, LawFlow captures dynamic, modular, and iterative reasoning
processes that reflect the ambiguity, revision, and client-adaptive strategies
of legal practice. Using LawFlow, we compare human and LLM-generated workflows,
revealing systematic differences in structure, reasoning flexibility, and plan
execution. Human workflows tend to be modular and adaptive, while LLM workflows
are more sequential, exhaustive, and less sensitive to downstream implications.
Our findings also suggest that legal professionals prefer AI to carry out
supportive roles, such as brainstorming, identifying blind spots, and surfacing
alternatives, rather than executing complex workflows end-to-end. Building on
these findings, we propose a set of design suggestions, rooted in empirical
observations, that align AI assistance with human goals of clarity,
completeness, creativity, and efficiency, through hybrid planning, adaptive
execution, and decision-point support. Our results highlight both the current
limitations of LLMs in supporting complex legal workflows and opportunities for
developing more collaborative, reasoning-aware legal AI systems. All data and
code are available on our project page

*Sanwoo Lee,Jiahao Liu,Qifan Wang,Jingang Wang,Xunliang Cai,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种动态Fisher加权合并方法（DF-Merge），通过贝叶斯优化调整参数系数，显著提升了多任务模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法在性能上存在不足，无法达到多任务微调的水平。

Method: 提出DF-Merge框架，通过贝叶斯优化动态调整参数系数，并结合Fisher信息。

Result: 实验表明，DF-Merge在不同规模和任务上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DF-Merge通过统一合并策略，在少量验证数据和迭代次数下实现接近最优性能。

Abstract: The fine-tuning of pre-trained language models has resulted in the widespread
availability of task-specific models. Model merging offers an efficient way to
create multi-task models by combining these fine-tuned models at the parameter
level, without the need for training data or joint training on multiple
datasets. Existing merging approaches typically involve scaling the parameters
model-wise or integrating parameter importance parameter-wise. Both approaches
exhibit their own weaknesses, leading to a notable performance gap compared to
multi-task fine-tuning. In this paper, we unify these seemingly distinct
strategies into a more general merging framework, and introduce Dynamic
Fisher-weighted Merging (DF-Merge). Specifically, candidate models are
associated with a set of coefficients that linearly scale their fine-tuned
parameters. Bayesian optimization is applied to dynamically adjust these
coefficients, aiming to maximize overall performance on validation sets. Each
iteration of this process integrates parameter importance based on the Fisher
information conditioned by the coefficients. Experimental results show that
DF-Merge outperforms strong baselines across models of different sizes and a
variety of tasks. Our analysis shows that the effectiveness of DF-Merge arises
from the unified view of merging and that near-optimal performance is
achievable in a few iterations, even with minimal validation data.

*Mohammad Akbar-Tajari,Mohammad Taher Pilehvar,Mohammad Mahmoody*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: GoAT是一种基于图结构的方法，用于生成对抗性提示以测试大型语言模型（LLM）的对齐鲁棒性，其效果优于现有攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）仍易受对抗性越狱攻击，识别这些漏洞对提升模型鲁棒性至关重要。

Method: GoAT利用图结构框架生成对抗性提示，通过协同优化多条攻击路径，显著提高越狱成功率。

Result: GoAT在对抗鲁棒模型（如Llama）时，越狱成功率提升五倍，且无需访问目标模型参数。

Conclusion: GoAT通过动态图结构框架，有效提升了对抗性漏洞的探索能力，为LLM安全性提供了新工具。

Abstract: The challenge of ensuring Large Language Models (LLMs) align with societal
standards is of increasing interest, as these models are still prone to
adversarial jailbreaks that bypass their safety mechanisms. Identifying these
vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the robustness of LLMs against such
exploits. We propose Graph of ATtacks (GoAT), a method for generating
adversarial prompts to test the robustness of LLM alignment using the Graph of
Thoughts framework [Besta et al., 2024]. GoAT excels at generating highly
effective jailbreak prompts with fewer queries to the victim model than
state-of-the-art attacks, achieving up to five times better jailbreak success
rate against robust models like Llama. Notably, GoAT creates high-quality,
human-readable prompts without requiring access to the targeted model's
parameters, making it a black-box attack. Unlike approaches constrained by
tree-based reasoning, GoAT's reasoning is based on a more intricate graph
structure. By making simultaneous attack paths aware of each other's progress,
this dynamic framework allows a deeper integration and refinement of reasoning
paths, significantly enhancing the collaborative exploration of adversarial
vulnerabilities in LLMs. At a technical level, GoAT starts with a graph
structure and iteratively refines it by combining and improving thoughts,
enabling synergy between different thought paths. The code for our
implementation can be found at: https://github.com/GoAT-pydev/Graph_of_Attacks.

Conclusion: 研究证明了数据集增强、推理驱动标签预测、硬投票和微调技术在自动化学术文本分类中的有效性。

Abstract: Efficient text classification is essential for handling the increasing volume
of academic publications. This study explores the use of pre-trained language
models (PLMs), including BERT, SciBERT, BioBERT, and BlueBERT, fine-tuned on
the Web of Science (WoS-46985) dataset for scientific text classification. To
enhance performance, we augment the dataset by executing seven targeted queries
in the WoS database, retrieving 1,000 articles per category aligned with
WoS-46985's main classes. PLMs predict labels for this unlabeled data, and a
hard-voting strategy combines predictions for improved accuracy and confidence.
Fine-tuning on the expanded dataset with dynamic learning rates and early
stopping significantly boosts classification accuracy, especially in
specialized domains. Domain-specific models like SciBERT and BioBERT
consistently outperform general-purpose models such as BERT. These findings
underscore the efficacy of dataset augmentation, inference-driven label
prediction, hard-voting, and fine-tuning techniques in creating robust and
scalable solutions for automated academic text classification.

Motivation: 在基于强化学习的知识蒸馏中，梯度估计的高方差问题影响了优化效果，尤其是在学生模型较大时。

Method: 使用多步Bellman最优方程诱导k步回报，减少梯度估计的方差。

Result: 在三个文本生成任务中，该方法在标准任务指标和基于大语言模型（LLM）的评估中表现优异。

Conclusion: k步回报诱导为增强基于强化学习的知识蒸馏提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel k-step return estimation method (called KETCHUP) for
Reinforcement Learning(RL)-based knowledge distillation (KD) in text generation
tasks. Our idea is to induce a K-step return by using the Bellman Optimality
Equation for multiple steps. Theoretical analysis shows that this K-step
formulation reduces the variance of the gradient estimates, thus leading to
improved RL optimization especially when the student model size is large.
Empirical evaluation on three text generation tasks demonstrates that our
approach yields superior performance in both standard task metrics and large
language model (LLM)-based evaluation. These results suggest that our K-step
return induction offers a promising direction for enhancing RL-based KD in LLM
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAP解码目标与实际翻译质量不一致，导致低质量或病态假设，需改进解码方法。

Method: 通过直接优化假设似然与翻译质量的Pearson相关性，校准解码目标。

Result: 在LLMs上显著提升翻译质量，校准后的似然接近或超越现有翻译质量估计模型。

Conclusion: 校准解码目标能有效提升翻译质量，且方法适用于多种场景，已开源模型和代码。

Abstract: Neural machine translation (NMT) systems typically employ maximum a
posteriori (MAP) decoding to select the highest-scoring translation from the
distribution mass. However, recent evidence highlights the inadequacy of MAP
decoding, often resulting in low-quality or even pathological hypotheses -- the
decoding objective is not aligned with real-world translation quality. This
paper proposes calibrating hypothesis likelihoods with translation quality from
a distribution view by directly optimizing their Pearson correlation -- thereby
enhancing the effectiveness of translation decoding. With our method,
translation on large language models (LLMs) improves substantially after
limited training (2K instances per direction). This improvement is orthogonal
to those achieved through supervised fine-tuning, leading to substantial gains
across a broad range of metrics and human evaluations -- even when applied to
top-performing translation-specialized LLMs fine-tuned on high-quality
translation data, such as Tower, or when compared to recent preference
optimization methods, like CPO. Moreover, the calibrated translation likelihood
can directly serve as a strong proxy for translation quality, closely
approximating or even surpassing some state-of-the-art translation quality
estimation models, like CometKiwi. Lastly, our in-depth analysis demonstrates
that calibration enhances the effectiveness of MAP decoding, thereby enabling
greater efficiency in real-world deployment. The resulting state-of-the-art
translation model, which covers 10 languages, along with the accompanying code
and human evaluation data, has been released to the community:

Motivation: 临床摘要在医疗保健中至关重要，但复杂医疗数据的准确摘要需要自动化工具。LLMs因其自然语言理解能力而显示出潜力。

Method: 通过数值模拟评估开源LLMs在出院报告中的关键事件提取能力，并检测摘要中的幻觉现象。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在提取关键事件方面表现良好，但存在幻觉问题，可能影响信息可靠性。

Conclusion: 开源LLMs在临床摘要中有潜力，但需进一步优化以减少幻觉，确保信息准确性。

Abstract: Clinical summarization is crucial in healthcare as it distills complex
medical data into digestible information, enhancing patient understanding and
care management. Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential
in automating and improving the accuracy of such summarizations due to their
advanced natural language understanding capabilities. These models are
particularly applicable in the context of summarizing medical/clinical texts,
where precise and concise information transfer is essential. In this paper, we
investigate the effectiveness of open-source LLMs in extracting key events from
discharge reports, such as reasons for hospital admission, significant
in-hospital events, and critical follow-up actions. In addition, we also assess
the prevalence of various types of hallucinations in the summaries produced by
these models. Detecting hallucinations is vital as it directly influences the
reliability of the information, potentially affecting patient care and
treatment outcomes. We conduct comprehensive numerical simulations to
rigorously evaluate the performance of these models, further probing the
accuracy and fidelity of the extracted content in clinical summarization.

Motivation: 极端天气事件的准确评估对研究和政策至关重要，但许多地区缺乏细粒度数据，限制了分析和决策能力。

Method: 提出EWRA方法，利用LLMs的推理路径增强SLMs，并构建ExtremeWeatherNews数据集，用于极端天气分类、主题标注和情感分析。

Result: EWRA方法使SLMs生成领域对齐的响应，性能优于任务专用模型，提升了极端天气分析的实用性。

Conclusion: EWRA和ExtremeWeatherNews组成的ClimaEmpact框架为极端天气分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate assessments of extreme weather events are vital for research and
policy, yet localized and granular data remain scarce in many parts of the
world. This data gap limits our ability to analyze potential outcomes and
implications of extreme weather events, hindering effective decision-making.
Large Language Models (LLMs) can process vast amounts of unstructured text
data, extract meaningful insights, and generate detailed assessments by
synthesizing information from multiple sources. Furthermore, LLMs can
seamlessly transfer their general language understanding to smaller models,
enabling these models to retain key knowledge while being fine-tuned for
specific tasks. In this paper, we propose Extreme Weather Reasoning-Aware
Alignment (EWRA), a method that enhances small language models (SLMs) by
incorporating structured reasoning paths derived from LLMs, and
ExtremeWeatherNews, a large dataset of extreme weather event-related news
articles. EWRA and ExtremeWeatherNews together form the overall framework,
ClimaEmpact, that focuses on addressing three critical extreme-weather tasks:
categorization of tangible vulnerabilities/impacts, topic labeling, and emotion
analysis. By aligning SLMs with advanced reasoning strategies on
ExtremeWeatherNews (and its derived dataset ExtremeAlign used specifically for
SLM alignment), EWRA improves the SLMs' ability to generate well-grounded and
domain-specific responses for extreme weather analytics. Our results show that
the approach proposed guides SLMs to output domain-aligned responses,
surpassing the performance of task-specific models and offering enhanced
real-world applicability for extreme weather analytics.

Motivation: Hinglish作为一种混合语言，存在拼写不一致、缺乏标准化和高质量对话数据的问题，需要开发高效的模型来处理这些挑战。

Method: 评估了多种预训练跨语言模型（如Gemma3-4B和Qwen2.5-7B），并采用微调技术，结合合成生成的对话和现有Hinglish数据集。

Conclusion: 通过适当微调和高质量数据，小模型也能在Hinglish对话任务中表现优异，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: This paper presents our process for developing a sample-efficient language
model for a conversational Hinglish chatbot. Hinglish, a code-mixed language
that combines Hindi and English, presents a unique computational challenge due
to inconsistent spelling, lack of standardization, and limited quality of
conversational data. This work evaluates multiple pre-trained cross-lingual
language models, including Gemma3-4B and Qwen2.5-7B, and employs fine-tuning
techniques to improve performance on Hinglish conversational tasks. The
proposed approach integrates synthetically generated dialogues with insights
from existing Hinglish datasets to address data scarcity. Experimental results
demonstrate that models with fewer parameters, when appropriately fine-tuned on
high-quality code-mixed data, can achieve competitive performance for Hinglish
conversation generation while maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型推理成本高和响应延迟的问题。

Method: 使用轻量级草稿模型进行思维级草拟，选择最佳CoT草稿并用目标模型纠正错误。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SCoT将推理延迟降低48%~66%，同时性能接近目标模型水平。

Conclusion: SCoT是一种高效且性能接近目标模型的推理加速方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1 and Deepseek-R1 have
recently attracted widespread attention due to their impressive task-solving
abilities. However, the enormous model size and the generation of lengthy
thought chains introduce significant reasoning costs and response latency.
Existing methods for efficient reasoning mainly focus on reducing the number of
model parameters or shortening the chain-of-thought length. In this paper, we
introduce Speculative Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), which reduces reasoning latency
from another perspective by accelerated average reasoning speed through large
and small model collaboration. SCoT conducts thought-level drafting using a
lightweight draft model. Then it selects the best CoT draft and corrects the
error cases with the target model. The proposed thinking behavior alignment
improves the efficiency of drafting and the draft selection strategy maintains
the prediction accuracy for complex problems. Experimental results on GSM8K,
MATH, GaoKao, CollegeMath and Olympiad datasets show that SCoT reduces
reasoning latency by 48\%$\sim$66\% for Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B while
achieving near-target-model-level performance. Our code is available at

Conclusion: FedE4RAG为私有RAG系统提供了一种高效且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising
solution for enhancing the accuracy and credibility of Large Language Models
(LLMs), particularly in Question & Answer tasks. This is achieved by
incorporating proprietary and private data from integrated databases. However,
private RAG systems face significant challenges due to the scarcity of private
domain data and critical data privacy issues. These obstacles impede the
deployment of private RAG systems, as developing privacy-preserving RAG systems
requires a delicate balance between data security and data availability. To
address these challenges, we regard federated learning (FL) as a highly
promising technology for privacy-preserving RAG services. We propose a novel
framework called Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (FedE4RAG). This
framework facilitates collaborative training of client-side RAG retrieval
models. The parameters of these models are aggregated and distributed on a
central-server, ensuring data privacy without direct sharing of raw data. In
FedE4RAG, knowledge distillation is employed for communication between the
server and client models. This technique improves the generalization of local
RAG retrievers during the federated learning process. Additionally, we apply
homomorphic encryption within federated learning to safeguard model parameters
and mitigate concerns related to data leakage. Extensive experiments conducted
on the real-world dataset have validated the effectiveness of FedE4RAG. The
results demonstrate that our proposed framework can markedly enhance the
performance of private RAG systems while maintaining robust data privacy
protection.

Conclusion: 为证明工程中的代理工作流奠定基础，未来将扩展至多文件协调、项目级验证和自主代理。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in formal
theorem proving, yet existing benchmarks remain limited to isolated, static
proof tasks, failing to capture the iterative, engineering-intensive workflows
of real-world formal mathematics libraries. Motivated by analogous advances in
software engineering, we introduce the paradigm of Automated Proof Engineering
(APE), which aims to automate proof engineering tasks such as feature addition,
proof refactoring, and bug fixing using LLMs. To facilitate research in this
direction, we present APE-Bench I, the first realistic benchmark built from
real-world commit histories of Mathlib4, featuring diverse file-level tasks
described in natural language and verified via a hybrid approach combining the
Lean compiler and LLM-as-a-Judge. We further develop Eleanstic, a scalable
parallel verification infrastructure optimized for proof checking across
multiple versions of Mathlib. Empirical results on state-of-the-art LLMs
demonstrate strong performance on localized edits but substantial degradation
on handling complex proof engineering. This work lays the foundation for
developing agentic workflows in proof engineering, with future benchmarks
targeting multi-file coordination, project-scale verification, and autonomous
agents capable of planning, editing, and repairing formal libraries.

<details>

Motivation: 由于获取高质量的步骤级监督数据困难且成本高，评估LLM推理步骤的可靠性具有挑战性。

Method: SPC通过微调两个基础模型分别扮演“生成器”和“批评家”角色，进行对抗性游戏，利用强化学习优化模型性能。

Result: 在三个推理基准测试中，SPC逐步提升了错误检测能力（如ProcessBench准确率从70.8%提升至77.7%），并优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SPC显著提升了LLM的数学推理性能，优于现有最佳过程奖励模型。

Abstract: Evaluating the step-by-step reliability of large language model (LLM)
reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought, remains challenging due to the difficulty
and cost of obtaining high-quality step-level supervision. In this paper, we
introduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves
its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games,
eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning
two copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a "sneaky generator" that
deliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a
"critic" that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models
engage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic,
while the critic model seeks to identify the generator's errors. Using
reinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively
improve; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the
loser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution.
Experiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K,
DeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection
capabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and
surpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model. Furthermore, applying
SPC to guide the test-time search of diverse LLMs significantly improves their
mathematical reasoning performance on MATH500 and AIME2024, outperforming
state-of-the-art process reward models.

Motivation: 增强大型语言模型的表达能力和上下文连贯性，而非单纯减少KV缓存大小。

Result: 显著提升模型在复杂推理和序列生成任务中的表现，同时参数增加极少。

Conclusion: WuNeng在表达能力和计算效率之间实现了新的平衡，为现代神经架构树立了新标准。

Abstract: The WuNeng architecture introduces a novel approach to enhancing the
expressivity and power of large language models by integrating recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based RWKV-7 with advanced attention mechanisms, prioritizing
heightened contextual coherence over reducing KV cache size. Building upon the
hybrid-head concept from Hymba, WuNeng augments standard multi-head attention
with additional RWKV-7 state-driven heads, rather than replacing existing
heads, to enrich the model's representational capacity. A cross-head
interaction technique fosters dynamic synergy among standard, state-driven, and
newly introduced middle heads, leveraging concatenation, additive modulation,
and gated fusion for robust information integration. Furthermore, a multi-token
state processing mechanism harnesses the continuous RWKV-7 state to capture
intricate, sequence-wide dependencies, significantly boosting expressivity.
Remarkably, these enhancements are achieved with minimal additional parameters,
ensuring efficiency while empowering the model to excel in complex reasoning
and sequence generation tasks. WuNeng sets a new standard for balancing
expressivity and computational efficiency in modern neural architectures.

similar importance, we find performance is not significantly or consistently

Abstract: Hallucinations are a persistent problem with Large Language Models (LLMs). As
these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as
healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is
crucial. To this end, we propose a versatile framework for zero-resource
hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases.
To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ)
techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge,
transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence
scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a tunable
ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual
confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble
for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation,
the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit,
UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an
extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks.
We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components
and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results
demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for
improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于多模态模型的新方法VIST-GPT，用于从图像序列生成连贯的视觉叙事，并引入了新的评估指标RoViST和GROOVIST。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标（如BLEU、METEOR等）不适用于视觉叙事任务，因此需要更符合人类判断的评估方法。

Method: 利用基于Transformer的多模态模型和大规模VIST数据集，开发了VIST-GPT模型。

Result: VIST-GPT能够生成视觉基础扎实、上下文合理的叙事。

Conclusion: RoViST和GROOVIST指标能更准确地评估叙事质量，优于传统指标。

Abstract: Visual storytelling is an interdisciplinary field combining computer vision
and natural language processing to generate cohesive narratives from sequences
of images. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages recent
advancements in multimodal models, specifically adapting transformer-based
architectures and large multimodal models, for the visual storytelling task.
Leveraging the large-scale Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset, our VIST-GPT
model produces visually grounded, contextually appropriate narratives. We
address the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU,
METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr, which are not suitable for this task. Instead, we
utilize RoViST and GROOVIST, novel reference-free metrics designed to assess
visual storytelling, focusing on visual grounding, coherence, and
non-redundancy. These metrics provide a more nuanced evaluation of narrative
quality, aligning closely with human judgment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在NLP任务中潜力巨大，但在移动设备上的应用仍受限于高质量数据来源的缺乏和人工标注的高成本。

Method: 开发AndroidGen框架，利用其收集任务轨迹并训练开源LLM，避免人工标注。

Result: 在AndroidWorld、AitW等平台上广泛评估，显示性能提升并揭示改进空间。

Conclusion: AndroidGen为LLM在移动设备上的应用提供了有效解决方案，未来仍有优化潜力。

Abstract: Large language models have opened up a world of possibilities for various NLP
tasks, sparking optimism for the future. Despite their potential, LLMs have yet
to be widely used as agents on real mobile devices. The main challenge is the
need for high-quality data sources. Time constraints and labor intensity often
hinder human annotation. On the other hand, existing LLMs exhibit inadequate
completion rates and need a robust data filtration strategy. Given these
challenges, we develop a framework called AndroidGen to enhance the
capabilities of LLM-based agents under data scarcity. In addition, we leverage
AndroidGen to collect trajectories given human tasks and train open-source LLMs
on these trajectories to develop an open-source mobile agent without manually
labeled trajectories. We extensively evaluate AndroidGen with AndroidWorld,
AitW, and various popular applications, demonstrating its improvements and
revealing potential areas for future improvement. Code, model, and data are
available at https://github.com/THUDM/AndroidGen.

TLDR: BrowseComp-ZH是一个高难度中文网页浏览基准测试，用于评估LLM代理的实时检索和推理能力，结果显示当前模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试（如BrowseComp）主要关注英语，忽略了中文等语言的信息生态复杂性，因此需要专门的中文测试基准。

Method: 构建了包含289个多跳问题的BrowseComp-ZH数据集，覆盖11个领域，采用两阶段质量控制确保问题难度和答案唯一性。

Result: 测试了20多个先进语言模型和代理搜索系统，大多数模型准确率低于10%，最佳表现者（OpenAI的DeepResearch）仅达42.9%。

Conclusion: BrowseComp-ZH展示了当前模型在中文网页检索和复杂推理方面的显著不足，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-using agents, the ability to
browse the web in real-time has become a critical yardstick for measuring their
reasoning and retrieval competence. Existing benchmarks such as BrowseComp
concentrate on English and overlook the linguistic, infrastructural, and
censorship-related complexities of other major information ecosystems -- most
notably Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce BrowseComp-ZH, a
high-difficulty benchmark purpose-built to comprehensively evaluate LLM agents
on the Chinese web. BrowseComp-ZH consists of 289 multi-hop questions spanning
11 diverse domains. Each question is reverse-engineered from a short,
objective, and easily verifiable answer (e.g., a date, number, or proper noun).
A two-stage quality control protocol is applied to strive for high question
difficulty and answer uniqueness. We benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art
language models and agentic search systems on our proposed BrowseComp-ZH.
Despite their strong conversational and retrieval capabilities, most models
struggle severely: a large number achieve accuracy rates below 10%, and only a
handful exceed 20%. Even the best-performing system, OpenAI's DeepResearch,
reaches just 42.9%. These results demonstrate the considerable difficulty of
BrowseComp-ZH, where success demands not only effective retrieval strategies,
but also sophisticated reasoning and information reconciliation -- capabilities
that current models still struggle to master. Our dataset, construction
guidelines, and benchmark results have been publicly released at
https://github.com/PALIN2018/BrowseComp-ZH.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种高效的任务特定数据生成方法，显著优于当前最先进的大型语言模型（LLMs），同时模型规模更小。通过预训练和多任务模型合并，进一步提升了泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在防止不良行为方面表现出潜力，但其高延迟、内存消耗、托管成本和非结构化输出限制了实际应用。

Method: 1. 任务特定数据生成；2. 预训练多任务模型（MultiTaskGuard）；3. 基于搜索的模型合并方法（UniGuard）。

Result: 在7个公共数据集和4个基准测试中，高效分类器在检测安全和不安全行为方面平均F1分数显著提升（29.92分优于Aegis-LlamaGuard，21.62分优于GPT-4o）。

Conclusion: 任务特定数据生成和模型合并方法显著提升了模型性能，同时降低了资源消耗。

Abstract: The trend towards large language models (LLMs) for guardrailing against
undesired behaviors is increasing and has shown promise for censoring user
inputs. However, increased latency, memory consumption, hosting expenses and
non-structured outputs can make their use prohibitive.
  In this work, we show that task-specific data generation can lead to
fine-tuned classifiers that significantly outperform current state of the art
(SoTA) while being orders of magnitude smaller. Secondly, we show that using a
single model, \texttt{MultiTaskGuard}, that is pretrained on a large
synthetically generated dataset with unique task instructions further improves
generalization. Thirdly, our most performant models, \texttt{UniGuard}, are
found using our proposed search-based model merging approach that finds an
optimal set of parameters to combine single-policy models and multi-policy
guardrail models. % On 7 public datasets and 4 guardrail benchmarks we created,
our efficient guardrail classifiers improve over the best performing SoTA
publicly available LLMs and 3$^{\text{rd}}$ party guardrail APIs in detecting
unsafe and safe behaviors by an average F1 score improvement of \textbf{29.92}
points over Aegis-LlamaGuard and \textbf{21.62} over \texttt{gpt-4o},
respectively. Lastly, our guardrail synthetic data generation process that uses

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动摘要方法未明确建模解释性内容，导致与人工摘要的匹配度不足。

Method: 提出两种话语驱动的计划策略，将计划作为输入或输出前缀的一部分。

Result: 在三个数据集上实验表明，该方法在摘要质量、鲁棒性和可控性上优于现有方法，并减少幻觉。

Conclusion: 基于话语框架的计划方法有效提升了摘要生成质量，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Lay summaries for scientific documents typically include explanations to help
readers grasp sophisticated concepts or arguments. However, current automatic
summarization methods do not explicitly model explanations, which makes it
difficult to align the proportion of explanatory content with human-written
summaries. In this paper, we present a plan-based approach that leverages
discourse frameworks to organize summary generation and guide explanatory
sentences by prompting responses to the plan. Specifically, we propose two
discourse-driven planning strategies, where the plan is conditioned as part of
the input or part of the output prefix, respectively. Empirical experiments on
three lay summarization datasets show that our approach outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of summary quality, and it enhances model
robustness, controllability, and mitigates hallucination.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出ICL CIPHERS方法，通过可逆的替代密码任务研究LLMs在上下文学习中的模式分离能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在上下文学习（ICL）中任务检索与任务学习两种模式的分离问题。

Method: 引入基于替代密码的任务重构方法ICL CIPHERS，通过可逆的符号替换测试LLMs的解密能力。

Result: LLMs在可逆密码任务（BIJECTIVE）上的表现优于不可逆基线（NON-BIJECTIVE），且结果在多个数据集和模型上一致。

Conclusion: ICL CIPHERS为量化ICL中的学习提供了新方法，并发现LLMs能解码加密输入。

Abstract: Recent works have suggested that In-Context Learning (ICL) operates in dual
modes, i.e. task retrieval (remember learned patterns from pre-training) and
task learning (inference-time ``learning'' from demonstrations). However,
disentangling these the two modes remains a challenging goal. We introduce ICL
CIPHERS, a class of task reformulations based on substitution ciphers borrowed
from classic cryptography. In this approach, a subset of tokens in the
in-context inputs are substituted with other (irrelevant) tokens, rendering
English sentences less comprehensible to human eye. However, by design, there
is a latent, fixed pattern to this substitution, making it reversible. This
bijective (reversible) cipher ensures that the task remains a well-defined task
in some abstract sense, despite the transformations. It is a curious question
if LLMs can solve ICL CIPHERS with a BIJECTIVE mapping, which requires
deciphering the latent cipher. We show that LLMs are better at solving ICL
CIPHERS with BIJECTIVE mappings than the NON-BIJECTIVE (irreversible) baseline,
providing a novel approach to quantify ``learning'' in ICL. While this gap is
small, it is consistent across the board on four datasets and six models.
Finally, we examine LLMs' internal representations and identify evidence in
their ability to decode the ciphered inputs.

Motivation: 现有教育问题生成数据集依赖预定义文本，无法反映真实课堂内容（如讲座语音和幻灯片），导致生成的问题质量不高。

Method: 提出了一种新框架，利用大语言模型动态选择和重写上下文，结合讲座转录和视频关键帧，生成与目标答案逻辑关联的问题。

Result: 该方法显著提高了生成问题的质量和相关性。

Conclusion: 论文通过真实课堂数据集和新框架，改进了教育问题生成的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Educational question generation (EQG) is a crucial component of intelligent
educational systems, significantly aiding self-assessment, active learning, and
personalized education. While EQG systems have emerged, existing datasets
typically rely on predefined, carefully edited texts, failing to represent
real-world classroom content, including lecture speech with a set of
complementary slides. To bridge this gap, we collect a dataset of educational
questions based on lectures from real-world classrooms. On this realistic
dataset, we find that current methods for EQG struggle with accurately
generating questions from educational videos, particularly in aligning with
specific timestamps and target answers. Common challenges include selecting
informative contexts from extensive transcripts and ensuring generated
questions meaningfully incorporate the target answer. To address the
challenges, we introduce a novel framework utilizing large language models for
dynamically selecting and rewriting contexts based on target timestamps and
answers. First, our framework selects contexts from both lecture transcripts
and video keyframes based on answer relevance and temporal proximity. Then, we
integrate the contexts selected from both modalities and rewrite them into
answer-containing knowledge statements, to enhance the logical connection
between the contexts and the desired answer. This approach significantly
improves the quality and relevance of the generated questions. Our dataset and
code are released in https://github.com/mengxiayu/COSER.

TLDR: Mem0是一种可扩展的记忆中心架构，通过动态提取、整合和检索对话中的关键信息，解决了LLMs在长时间多会话对话中的一致性挑战。其增强版本利用图记忆表示捕捉复杂关系结构，显著优于现有记忆系统，并降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在长时间对话中因固定上下文窗口导致的一致性不足问题。

Method: 提出Mem0架构，动态管理对话中的关键信息；进一步提出基于图记忆的增强版本，捕捉复杂关系。

Result: 在LOCOMO基准测试中，Mem0及其增强版本在四种问题类别上均优于现有记忆系统，计算开销显著降低。

Conclusion: 结构化、持久化的记忆机制对长期对话一致性至关重要，为高效可靠的LLM驱动AI代理铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess in
generating contextually coherent responses, yet their fixed context windows
pose fundamental challenges for maintaining consistency over prolonged
multi-session dialogues. We introduce Mem0, a scalable memory-centric
architecture that addresses this issue by dynamically extracting,
consolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations.
Building on this foundation, we further propose an enhanced variant that
leverages graph-based memory representations to capture complex relational
structures among conversational elements. Through comprehensive evaluations on
LOCOMO benchmark, we systematically compare our approaches against six baseline
categories: (i) established memory-augmented systems, (ii) retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) with varying chunk sizes and k-values, (iii) a full-context
approach that processes the entire conversation history, (iv) an open-source
memory solution, (v) a proprietary model system, and (vi) a dedicated memory
management platform. Empirical results show that our methods consistently
outperform all existing memory systems across four question categories:
single-hop, temporal, multi-hop, and open-domain. Notably, Mem0 achieves 26%
relative improvements in the LLM-as-a-Judge metric over OpenAI, while Mem0 with
graph memory achieves around 2% higher overall score than the base
configuration. Beyond accuracy gains, we also markedly reduce computational
overhead compared to full-context method. In particular, Mem0 attains a 91%
lower p95 latency and saves more than 90% token cost, offering a compelling
balance between advanced reasoning capabilities and practical deployment
constraints. Our findings highlight critical role of structured, persistent
memory mechanisms for long-term conversational coherence, paving the way for
more reliable and efficient LLM-driven AI agents.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the dynamic optimization of the Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) architecture. It proposes a state-aware dynamic knowledge
retrieval mechanism to enhance semantic understanding and knowledge scheduling
efficiency in large language models for open-domain question answering and
complex generation tasks. The method introduces a multi-level perceptive
retrieval vector construction strategy and a differentiable document matching
path. These components enable end-to-end joint training and collaborative
optimization of the retrieval and generation modules. This effectively
addresses the limitations of static RAG structures in context adaptation and
knowledge access. Experiments are conducted on the Natural Questions dataset.
The proposed structure is thoroughly evaluated across different large models,
including GPT-4, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek. Comparative and ablation experiments
from multiple perspectives confirm the significant improvements in BLEU and
ROUGE-L scores. The approach also demonstrates stronger robustness and
generation consistency in tasks involving semantic ambiguity and multi-document
fusion. These results highlight its broad application potential and practical
value in building high-quality language generation systems.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在不同响应格式（二元与连续）下判断的可靠性，尤其是潜在的偏见问题。

Method: 通过价值判断任务和文本情感分析任务，测试多种开源和商业LLMs在不同响应格式下的表现。

Result: LLMs在二元格式下表现出一致的负面偏见，控制实验证实这一现象在两种任务中均存在。

Conclusion: 任务设计中的响应格式选择对LLMs的判断有显著影响，需注意避免引入系统性偏差。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in tasks such as
psychological text analysis and decision-making in automated workflows.
However, their reliability remains a concern due to potential biases inherited
from their training process. In this study, we examine how different response
format: binary versus continuous, may systematically influence LLMs' judgments.
In a value statement judgments task and a text sentiment analysis task, we
prompted LLMs to simulate human responses and tested both formats across
several models, including both open-source and commercial models. Our findings
revealed a consistent negative bias: LLMs were more likely to deliver
"negative" judgments in binary formats compared to continuous ones. Control
experiments further revealed that this pattern holds across both tasks. Our
results highlight the importance of considering response format when applying
LLMs to decision tasks, as small changes in task design can introduce
systematic biases.

Motivation: LLMs在长上下文中容易产生幻觉（生成无依据或矛盾的信息），但现有研究尚未有效解决这一问题。

Method: 构建长上下文幻觉检测数据集，并提出基于预训练编码器（如BERT）的新架构，通过分解和聚合机制处理长上下文。

Result: 实验表明，该架构在多项指标上显著优于同类模型及LLM模型，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决长上下文幻觉问题提供了有效方法，未来可进一步优化和扩展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various tasks. However, they are prone to contextual hallucination, generating
information that is either unsubstantiated or contradictory to the given
context. Although many studies have investigated contextual hallucinations in
LLMs, addressing them in long-context inputs remains an open problem. In this
work, we take an initial step toward solving this problem by constructing a
dataset specifically designed for long-context hallucination detection.
Furthermore, we propose a novel architecture that enables pre-trained encoder
models, such as BERT, to process long contexts and effectively detect
contextual hallucinations through a decomposition and aggregation mechanism.
Our experimental results show that the proposed architecture significantly
outperforms previous models of similar size as well as LLM-based models across
various metrics, while providing substantially faster inference.

Result: 开源LLM表现与专有模型相当，医学微调模型表现较差；性能因模型规模、语言和任务类型而异。

Conclusion: BRIDGE为临床文本理解的LLM开发和评估提供了基础资源和参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for medical applications and
are evolving rapidly, with new models being released at an accelerated pace.
However, current evaluations of LLMs in clinical contexts remain limited. Most
existing benchmarks rely on medical exam-style questions or PubMed-derived
text, failing to capture the complexity of real-world electronic health record
(EHR) data. Others focus narrowly on specific application scenarios, limiting
their generalizability across broader clinical use. To address this gap, we
present BRIDGE, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 87 tasks
sourced from real-world clinical data sources across nine languages. We
systematically evaluated 52 state-of-the-art LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1,
GPT-4o, Gemini, and Llama 4) under various inference strategies. With a total
of 13,572 experiments, our results reveal substantial performance variation
across model sizes, languages, natural language processing tasks, and clinical
specialties. Notably, we demonstrate that open-source LLMs can achieve
performance comparable to proprietary models, while medically fine-tuned LLMs
based on older architectures often underperform versus updated general-purpose
models. The BRIDGE and its corresponding leaderboard serve as a foundational
resource and a unique reference for the development and evaluation of new LLMs
in real-world clinical text understanding.

Method: 论文通过分类冲突信息为三类（自然文本、人工标注数据、模型交互），分析其影响并提出缓解策略。

Result: 总结了冲突信息的来源及其对模型的影响，提出了统一的冲突信息概念和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 开发能够有效处理和协调冲突信息的NLP系统是未来的关键挑战。

Abstract: As NLP models become increasingly integrated into real-world applications, it
becomes clear that there is a need to address the fact that models often rely
on and generate conflicting information. Conflicts could reflect the complexity
of situations, changes that need to be explained and dealt with, difficulties
in data annotation, and mistakes in generated outputs. In all cases,
disregarding the conflicts in data could result in undesired behaviors of
models and undermine NLP models' reliability and trustworthiness. This survey
categorizes these conflicts into three key areas: (1) natural texts on the web,
where factual inconsistencies, subjective biases, and multiple perspectives
introduce contradictions; (2) human-annotated data, where annotator
disagreements, mistakes, and societal biases impact model training; and (3)
model interactions, where hallucinations and knowledge conflicts emerge during
deployment. While prior work has addressed some of these conflicts in
isolation, we unify them under the broader concept of conflicting information,
analyze their implications, and discuss mitigation strategies. We highlight key
challenges and future directions for developing conflict-aware NLP systems that
can reason over and reconcile conflicting information more effectively.

Method: 比较2020年（ChatGPT前）和2024年的推文数据集，使用Flesch-Kincaid可读性和极性评分分析文本复杂性和情感变化。

Result: 情感极性显著增加（0.12 vs. 0.04），中性内容减少（54.8%到39.8%），正面表达增加（28.6%到45.9%）。

Conclusion: AI在社交媒体中的介入不仅增加了其存在感，还显著影响了语言和情感表达模式。

Abstract: Given the subtle human-like effects of large language models on linguistic
patterns, this study examines shifts in language over time to detect the impact
of AI-mediated communication (AI- MC) on social media. We compare a replicated
dataset of 970,919 tweets from 2020 (pre-ChatGPT) with 20,000 tweets from the
same period in 2024, all of which mention Donald Trump during election periods.
Using a combination of Flesch-Kincaid readability and polarity scores, we
analyze changes in text complexity and sentiment. Our findings reveal a
significant increase in mean sentiment polarity (0.12 vs. 0.04) and a shift
from predominantly neutral content (54.8% in 2020 to 39.8% in 2024) to more
positive expressions (28.6% to 45.9%). These findings suggest not only an
increasing presence of AI in social media communication but also its impact on

Conclusion: 多智能体协作框架在生物医学LLM训练中具有潜力，能够高效生成高质量数据集。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) in biomedical research has
underscored the limitations of existing open-source annotated scientific
corpora, which are often insufficient in quantity and quality. Addressing the
challenge posed by the complex hierarchy of biomedical knowledge, we propose a
knowledge-driven, multi-agent framework for scientific corpus distillation
tailored for LLM training in the biomedical domain. Central to our approach is
a collaborative multi-agent architecture, where specialized agents, each guided
by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) hierarchy, work in concert to
autonomously extract, synthesize, and self-evaluate high-quality textual data
from vast scientific literature. These agents collectively generate and refine
domain-specific question-answer pairs, ensuring comprehensive coverage and
consistency with biomedical ontologies while minimizing manual involvement.
Extensive experimental results show that language models trained on our
multi-agent distilled datasets achieve notable improvements in biomedical
question-answering tasks, outperforming both strong life sciences LLM baselines
and advanced proprietary models. Notably, our AI-Ready dataset enables
Llama3-70B to surpass GPT-4 with MedPrompt and Med-PaLM-2, despite their larger
scale. Detailed ablation studies and case analyses further validate the
effectiveness and synergy of each agent within the framework, highlighting the
potential of multi-agent collaboration in biomedical LLM training.

a low-resource language with limited annotated datasets. To address these
challenges, we developed a comprehensive annotated dataset using narrative
texts from VnExpress, a widely-read Vietnamese online news platform. We
established detailed guidelines for annotating entities, focusing on ensuring
consistency and accuracy. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of large
language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, on this dataset.
Our results demonstrate that GPT-4 significantly outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo in
terms of both accuracy and response consistency, making it a more reliable tool
for coreference resolution in Vietnamese.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为VCM的自监督视觉概念建模框架，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了强大的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在图像处理上效率低下，缺乏视觉概念模型，限制了其实际应用。

Method: VCM通过隐式对比学习和视觉语言微调，构建无需昂贵标注的视觉概念模型。

Result: VCM显著减少计算成本（如LLaVA-1.5-7B的FLOPs减少85%），并在多种图像理解任务中保持高性能。

Conclusion: VCM通过实验验证了其有效性和效率，提升了视觉编码器在经典视觉概念感知任务中的能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are pivotal for real-world AI tasks like
embodied intelligence due to their strong vision-language reasoning abilities.
However, current LVLMs process entire images at the token level, which is
inefficient compared to humans who analyze information and generate content at
the conceptual level, extracting relevant visual concepts with minimal effort.
This inefficiency, stemming from the lack of a visual concept model, limits
LVLMs' usability in real-world applications. To address this, we propose VCM,
an end-to-end self-supervised visual concept modeling framework. VCM leverages
implicit contrastive learning across multiple sampled instances and
vision-language fine-tuning to construct a visual concept model without
requiring costly concept-level annotations. Our results show that VCM
significantly reduces computational costs (e.g., 85\% fewer FLOPs for
LLaVA-1.5-7B) while maintaining strong performance across diverse image
understanding tasks. Moreover, VCM enhances visual encoders' capabilities in
classic visual concept perception tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of VCM.

Motivation: 低资源语言如CKL在NLP领域缺乏标准化和全面的词性标注集，影响了其NLP任务的发展。

Method: 研究收集了不同研究和库尔德语言学专家的词性标注，设计了一个标准化的标注集，并与通用依赖框架进行了比较。

Result: 提出的词性标注集能够更准确地标注CKL语料库，并支持库尔德语的NLP任务。

Conclusion: 该标注集为库尔德语的NLP任务提供了标准化支持，提升了任务性能。

Abstract: - The field of natural language processing (NLP) has dramatically expanded
within the last decade. Many human-being applications are conducted daily via
NLP tasks, starting from machine translation, speech recognition, text
generation and recommendations, Part-of-Speech tagging (POS), and Named-Entity
Recognition (NER). However, low-resourced languages, such as the
Central-Kurdish language (CKL), mainly remain unexamined due to shortage of
necessary resources to support their development. The POS tagging task is the
base of other NLP tasks; for example, the POS tag set has been used to
standardized languages to provide the relationship between words among the
sentences, followed by machine translation and text recommendation.
Specifically, for the CKL, most of the utilized or provided POS tagsets are
neither standardized nor comprehensive. To this end, this study presented an
accurate and comprehensive POS tagset for the CKL to provide better performance
of the Kurdish NLP tasks. The article also collected most of the POS tags from
different studies as well as from Kurdish linguistic experts to standardized
part-of-speech tags. The proposed POS tagset is designed to annotate a large
CKL corpus and support Kurdish NLP tasks. The initial investigations of this
study via comparison with the Universal Dependencies framework for standard
languages, show that the proposed POS tagset can streamline or correct
sentences more accurately for Kurdish NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型主要关注单模态数值序列，忽略了时间序列中的多模态信息。

Method: 结合时间戳建立时间相关性，利用文本作为历史描述的补充，并通过无分类器方式动态对齐和控制。

Result: 在八个领域的真实数据集上，MCD-TSF实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MCD-TSF通过多模态信息显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable success in processing images and text,
and have been extended to special domains such as time series forecasting
(TSF). Existing diffusion-based approaches for TSF primarily focus on modeling
single-modality numerical sequences, overlooking the rich multimodal
information in time series data. To effectively leverage such information for
prediction, we propose a multimodal conditioned diffusion model for TSF,
namely, MCD-TSF, to jointly utilize timestamps and texts as extra guidance for
time series modeling, especially for forecasting. Specifically, Timestamps are
combined with time series to establish temporal and semantic correlations among
different data points when aggregating information along the temporal
dimension. Texts serve as supplementary descriptions of time series' history,
and adaptively aligned with data points as well as dynamically controlled in a
classifier-free manner. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets
across eight domains demonstrate that the proposed MCD-TSF model achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Generative AI have achieved remarkable
progress, evolving into sophisticated and versatile tools widely adopted across
various domains and applications. However, the substantial memory overhead
caused by their vast number of parameters, combined with the high computational

methods, covering fundamental instance-level approaches, in-depth cluster-level
strategies, emerging scenario directions, and other miscellaneous but important
areas. At the instance level, we review model placement, request scheduling,
decoding length prediction, storage management, and the disaggregation
paradigm. At the cluster level, we explore GPU cluster deployment,
multi-instance load balancing, and cloud service solutions. For emerging
scenarios, we organize the discussion around specific tasks, modules, and
auxiliary methods. To ensure a holistic overview, we also highlight several
niche yet critical areas. Finally, we outline potential research directions to
further advance the field of LLM inference serving.

Abstract: Dialogue data has been a key source for understanding learning processes,
offering critical insights into how students engage in collaborative
discussions and how these interactions shape their knowledge construction. The
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced promising opportunities
for advancing qualitative research, particularly in the automated coding of
dialogue data. However, the inherent contextual complexity of dialogue presents
unique challenges for these models, especially in understanding and
interpreting complex contextual information. This study addresses these
challenges by developing a novel LLM-assisted automated coding approach for
dialogue data. The novelty of our proposed framework is threefold: 1) We
predict the code for an utterance based on dialogue-specific characteristics --
communicative acts and communicative events -- using separate prompts following
the role prompts and chain-of-thoughts methods; 2) We engaged multiple LLMs
including GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o, DeepSeek in collaborative code prediction; 3) We
leveraged the interrelation between events and acts to implement consistency
checking using GPT-4o. In particular, our contextual consistency checking
provided a substantial accuracy improvement. We also found the accuracy of act
predictions was consistently higher than that of event predictions. This study
contributes a new methodological framework for enhancing the precision of
automated coding of dialogue data as well as offers a scalable solution for
addressing the contextual challenges inherent in dialogue analysis.

performance degrades with increasing context complexity, particularly for
low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. We further fine-tune the open-source

Surprisingly, low-resource languages have a stronger impact on multilingual

Result: 在2934个模型和21000+实例上验证，LRMF比基线方法相关性提高7-10个百分点。

Conclusion: 谱系约束为LLM开发提供了资源高效的性能预测方法。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) before
extensive fine-tuning or merging can substantially reduce both computational
expense and development time. Although prior approaches like scaling laws
account for global factors such as parameter size or training tokens, they
often overlook explicit lineage relationships - i.e., which models are derived
or merged from which parents. In this work, we propose a novel
Lineage-Regularized Matrix Factorization (LRMF) framework that encodes
ancestral ties among LLMs via a graph Laplacian regularizer. By leveraging
multi-hop parent-child connections, LRMF consistently outperforms conventional
matrix factorization and collaborative filtering methods in both instance-level
and benchmark-level performance prediction. Our large-scale study includes
2,934 publicly available Hugging Face models and 21,000+ instances across 6
major benchmarks, showing that lineage constraints yield up to 7-10 percentage
points higher correlation with actual performance compared to baselines.
Moreover, LRMF effectively addresses the cold-start problem, providing accurate
estimates for newly derived or merged models even with minimal data. This
lineage-guided strategy thus offers a resource-efficient way to inform
hyperparameter tuning, data selection, and model combination in modern LLM
development.

Conclusion: 翻译创造性对认知负荷的影响是新颖发现，为未来研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: This article presents the results of a pilot study involving the reception of
a fictional short story translated from English into Dutch under four
conditions: machine translation (MT), post-editing (PE), human translation (HT)
and original source text (ST). The aim is to understand how creativity and
errors in different translation modalities affect readers, specifically
regarding cognitive load. Eight participants filled in a questionnaire, read a
story using an eye-tracker, and conducted a retrospective think-aloud (RTA)
interview. The results show that units of creative potential (UCP) increase
cognitive load and that this effect is highest for HT and lowest for MT; no
effect of error was observed. Triangulating the data with RTAs leads us to
hypothesize that the higher cognitive load in UCPs is linked to increases in
reader enjoyment and immersion. The effect of translation creativity on
cognitive load in different translation modalities at word-level is novel and
opens up new avenues for further research. All the code and data are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统领域自适应持续预训练（DAPT）需要大量领域相关数据，但在非英语领域（如德语过程工业）中难以获取。

Method: 采用ICL和kNN技术，通过上下文学习和近邻搜索增强目标数据。

Result: ICL-APT在平均IR指标上比DAPT提升3.5分，计算时间减少近4倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算资源有限的行业提供了经济高效的解决方案，并适用于其他低资源领域。

Abstract: Domain-adaptive continual pretraining (DAPT) is a state-of-the-art technique
that further trains a language model (LM) on its pretraining task, e.g.,
language masking. Although popular, it requires a significant corpus of
domain-related data, which is difficult to obtain for specific domains in
languages other than English, such as the process industry in the German
language. This paper introduces an efficient approach called ICL-augmented
pretraining or ICL-APT that leverages in-context learning (ICL) and k-nearest
neighbors (kNN) to augment target data with domain-related and in-domain texts,
significantly reducing GPU time while maintaining strong model performance. Our
results show that this approach performs better than traditional DAPT by 3.5 of
the average IR metrics (e.g., mAP, MRR, and nDCG) and requires almost 4 times
less computing time, providing a cost-effective solution for industries with
limited computational capacity. The findings highlight the broader
applicability of this framework to other low-resource industries, making
NLP-based solutions more accessible and feasible in production environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统存在存储效率低下的问题，包括权重复制、KV缓存传输开销、存储不平衡等，导致高请求率下性能不佳。

Method: 提出semi-PD系统，采用分离计算与统一存储设计，引入计算资源控制器和统一内存管理器，并实现低开销资源调整和SLO感知的动态分区算法。

Result: semi-PD在高请求率下保持更低延迟，平均端到端延迟降低1.27-2.58倍，并在延迟约束下服务更多请求（1.55-1.72倍）。

Conclusion: semi-PD通过优化计算与存储设计，显著提升了LLM服务系统的性能和效率。

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM) serving systems fall into two categories:
1) a unified system where prefill phase and decode phase are co-located on the
same GPU, sharing the unified computational resource and storage, and 2) a
disaggregated system where the two phases are disaggregated to different GPUs.
The design of the disaggregated system addresses the latency interference and
sophisticated scheduling issues in the unified system but leads to storage
challenges including 1) replicated weights for both phases that prevent
flexible deployment, 2) KV cache transfer overhead between the two phases, 3)
storage imbalance that causes substantial wasted space of the GPU capacity, and
4) suboptimal resource adjustment arising from the difficulties in migrating KV
cache. Such storage inefficiency delivers poor serving performance under high
request rates.
  In this paper, we identify that the advantage of the disaggregated system
lies in the disaggregated computation, i.e., partitioning the computational
resource to enable the asynchronous computation of two phases. Thus, we propose
a novel LLM serving system, semi-PD, characterized by disaggregated computation
and unified storage. In semi-PD, we introduce a computation resource controller
to achieve disaggregated computation at the streaming multi-processor (SM)
level, and a unified memory manager to manage the asynchronous memory access
from both phases. semi-PD has a low-overhead resource adjustment mechanism
between the two phases, and a service-level objective (SLO) aware dynamic
partitioning algorithm to optimize the SLO attainment. Compared to
state-of-the-art systems, semi-PD maintains lower latency at higher request
rates, reducing the average end-to-end latency per request by 1.27-2.58x on
DeepSeek series models, and serves 1.55-1.72x more requests adhering to latency
constraints on Llama series models.

Motivation: 传统判别方法忽视了LLMs的生成能力，而现有生成式分类方法仅依赖简单SFT，未系统探索训练与推理提示的交互。

Method: GenCLS++联合优化SFT和RL，探索五种策略维度（如上下文学习变体、类别定义等），并在推理时应用困惑度解码。

Conclusion: GenCLS++为生成式分类提供了统一框架，揭示了显式推理对分类任务的负面影响，为未来LLM应用提供指导。

Abstract: As a fundamental task in machine learning, text classification plays a
crucial role in many areas. With the rapid scaling of Large Language Models
(LLMs), particularly through reinforcement learning (RL), there is a growing
need for more capable discriminators. Consequently, advances in classification
are becoming increasingly vital for enhancing the overall capabilities of LLMs.
Traditional discriminative methods map text to labels but overlook LLMs'
intrinsic generative strengths. Generative classification addresses this by
prompting the model to directly output labels. However, existing studies still
rely on simple SFT alone, seldom probing the interplay between training and
inference prompts, and no work has systematically leveraged RL for generative
text classifiers and unified SFT, RL, and inference-time prompting in one
framework. We bridge this gap with GenCLS++, a framework that jointly optimizes
SFT and RL while systematically exploring five high-level strategy
dimensions-in-context learning variants, category definitions, explicit
uncertainty labels, semantically irrelevant numeric labels, and
perplexity-based decoding-during both training and inference. After an SFT
"policy warm-up," we apply RL with a simple rule-based reward, yielding sizable
extra gains. Across seven datasets, GenCLS++ achieves an average accuracy
improvement of 3.46% relative to the naive SFT baseline; on public datasets,
this improvement rises to 4.00%. Notably, unlike reasoning-intensive tasks that
benefit from explicit thinking processes, we find that classification tasks
perform better without such reasoning steps. These insights into the role of
explicit reasoning provide valuable guidance for future LLM applications.

Abstract: The growing spread of online misinformation has created an urgent need for
scalable, reliable fact-checking solutions. Crowdsourced fact-checking - where
non-experts evaluate claim veracity - offers a cost-effective alternative to
expert verification, despite concerns about variability in quality and bias.
Encouraged by promising results in certain contexts, major platforms such as X
(formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram have begun shifting from
centralized moderation to decentralized, crowd-based approaches.
  In parallel, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance across core fact-checking tasks, including claim detection and
evidence evaluation. However, their potential role in crowdsourced workflows
remains unexplored. This paper investigates whether LLM-powered generative
agents - autonomous entities that emulate human behavior and decision-making -
can meaningfully contribute to fact-checking tasks traditionally reserved for
human crowds. Using the protocol of La Barbera et al. (2024), we simulate
crowds of generative agents with diverse demographic and ideological profiles.
Agents retrieve evidence, assess claims along multiple quality dimensions, and
issue final veracity judgments.
  Our results show that agent crowds outperform human crowds in truthfulness
classification, exhibit higher internal consistency, and show reduced
susceptibility to social and cognitive biases. Compared to humans, agents rely
more systematically on informative criteria such as Accuracy, Precision, and
Informativeness, suggesting a more structured decision-making process. Overall,
our findings highlight the potential of generative agents as scalable,
consistent, and less biased contributors to crowd-based fact-checking systems.

TLDR: TD-EVAL是一个两阶段评估框架，结合细粒度轮次级分析和整体对话级比较，用于评估任务导向对话系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动评估方法无法检测用户与代理交互中的关键中间错误，TD-EVAL旨在填补这一空白。

Method: TD-EVAL通过轮次级评估（对话连贯性、后端知识一致性和策略合规性）和对话级比较（TOD Agent Arena）实现评估。

Result: 实验表明，TD-EVAL能有效识别传统指标遗漏的错误，且比传统和基于LLM的指标更符合人类判断。

Conclusion: TD-EVAL为任务导向对话系统评估提供了新范式，支持轮次和系统级的高效评估。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are experiencing a revolution driven by
Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the evaluation methodologies for these
systems remain insufficient for their growing sophistication. While traditional
automatic metrics effectively assessed earlier modular systems, they focus
solely on the dialogue level and cannot detect critical intermediate errors
that can arise during user-agent interactions. In this paper, we introduce
TD-EVAL (Turn and Dialogue-level Evaluation), a two-step evaluation framework
that unifies fine-grained turn-level analysis with holistic dialogue-level
comparisons. At turn level, we evaluate each response along three TOD-specific
dimensions: conversation cohesion, backend knowledge consistency, and policy
compliance. Meanwhile, we design TOD Agent Arena that uses pairwise comparisons
to provide a measure of dialogue-level quality. Through experiments on MultiWOZ
2.4 and {\tau}-Bench, we demonstrate that TD-EVAL effectively identifies the
conversational errors that conventional metrics miss. Furthermore, TD-EVAL
exhibits better alignment with human judgments than traditional and LLM-based
metrics. These findings demonstrate that TD-EVAL introduces a new paradigm for
TOD system evaluation, efficiently assessing both turn and system levels with a
plug-and-play framework for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究探讨了在电信领域问答任务中，知识蒸馏（KD）中教师模型、学生模型或两者在领域适应中的作用，并通过实验验证了不同词汇表和KD算法对蒸馏模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在领域特定任务中，教师模型、学生模型或两者是否需要进行领域适应的问题。

Method: 通过监督微调（SFT）教师模型、学生模型或两者，并比较不同词汇表和KD算法（普通KD和双空间KD）的效果。

Result: 实验表明，教师模型的SFT在词汇表相同时能提升蒸馏模型性能，而同时微调教师和学生模型在所有指标上表现更好。

Conclusion: 教师和学生模型的SFT结合能显著提升蒸馏模型性能，但词汇表的选择会影响统计显著性。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one of the approaches to reduce the size of
Large Language Models (LLMs). A LLM with smaller number of model parameters
(student) is trained to mimic the performance of a LLM of a larger size
(teacher model) on a specific task. For domain-specific tasks, it is not clear
if teacher or student model, or both, must be considered for domain adaptation.
In this work, we study this problem from perspective of telecom domain
Question-Answering (QA) task. We systematically experiment with Supervised
Fine-tuning (SFT) of teacher only, SFT of student only and SFT of both prior to
KD. We design experiments to study the impact of vocabulary (same and
different) and KD algorithms (vanilla KD and Dual Space KD, DSKD) on the
distilled model. Multi-faceted evaluation of the distillation using 14
different metrics (N-gram, embedding and LLM-based metrics) is considered.
Experimental results show that SFT of teacher improves performance of distilled
model when both models have same vocabulary, irrespective of algorithm and
metrics. Overall, SFT of both teacher and student results in better performance
across all metrics, although the statistical significance of the same depends
on the vocabulary of the teacher models.

Motivation: 在线假新闻管理面临LLM恶意生成假新闻的新挑战，现有研究未充分探讨其大规模发布对新闻生态的影响。

Method: 开发了模拟管道和包含约56k条多样化生成新闻的数据集，研究LLM假新闻在神经新闻推荐系统中的效果。

Result: 发现真相衰减现象，即真实新闻在排名中逐渐落后于假新闻，并从熟悉度角度解释了原因，展示了困惑度与新闻排名的正相关性。

Conclusion: 讨论了LLM假新闻的威胁并提出可能的对策，呼吁利益相关者应对这一新兴挑战以维护新闻生态的完整性。

Abstract: Online fake news moderation now faces a new challenge brought by the
malicious use of large language models (LLMs) in fake news production. Though
existing works have shown LLM-generated fake news is hard to detect from an
individual aspect, it remains underexplored how its large-scale release will
impact the news ecosystem. In this study, we develop a simulation pipeline and
a dataset with ~56k generated news of diverse types to investigate the effects
of LLM-generated fake news within neural news recommendation systems. Our
findings expose a truth decay phenomenon, where real news is gradually losing
its advantageous position in news ranking against fake news as LLM-generated
news is involved in news recommendation. We further provide an explanation
about why truth decay occurs from a familiarity perspective and show the
positive correlation between perplexity and news ranking. Finally, we discuss
the threats of LLM-generated fake news and provide possible countermeasures. We
urge stakeholders to address this emerging challenge to preserve the integrity
of news ecosystems.

Motivation: 探讨多语言大模型在低资源语言（如印度语言）中的事实准确性，验证其是否能在区域语境中可靠工作。

Method: 使用IndicQuest数据集（含英语和19种印度语言的问答对），比较模型在英语和印度语言中的表现。

Result: 模型在英语中表现更优，印度语言中幻觉现象更显著。

Conclusion: 当前多语言大模型在低资源语言中的理解能力仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
effectiveness across various languages, particularly in high-resource languages
such as English. However, their performance in terms of factual accuracy across
other low-resource languages, especially Indic languages, remains an area of
investigation. In this study, we assess the factual accuracy of LLMs - GPT-4o,
Gemma-2-9B, Gemma-2-2B, and Llama-3.1-8B - by comparing their performance in
English and Indic languages using the IndicQuest dataset, which contains
question-answer pairs in English and 19 Indic languages. By asking the same
questions in English and their respective Indic translations, we analyze
whether the models are more reliable for regional context questions in Indic
languages or when operating in English. Our findings reveal that LLMs often
perform better in English, even for questions rooted in Indic contexts.
Notably, we observe a higher tendency for hallucination in responses generated
in low-resource Indic languages, highlighting challenges in the multilingual
understanding capabilities of current LLMs.

TLDR: AutoJudge框架通过任务特定的有损推测解码加速LLM推理，识别不影响下游质量的“不重要”令牌以提升速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码需逐令牌匹配目标模型输出分布，限制了推理速度。AutoJudge旨在通过放松对不重要令牌的生成要求，提高效率。

Method: 采用半贪婪搜索算法识别需纠正的令牌不匹配，并训练轻量级分类器预测可安全接受的令牌。

Result: 在GSM8K推理任务中，AutoJudge比标准推测解码多接受1.5倍令牌，准确率下降<1%；在编程任务中也能泛化。

Conclusion: AutoJudge通过有选择地接受令牌不匹配，显著提升推理速度且保持高质量，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: We introduce AutoJudge, a framework that accelerates large language model
(LLM) inference with task-specific lossy speculative decoding. Instead of
matching the original model output distribution token-by-token, we identify
which of the generated tokens affect the downstream quality of the generated
response, relaxing the guarantee so that the "unimportant" tokens can be
generated faster. Our approach relies on a semi-greedy search algorithm to test
which of the mismatches between target and draft model should be corrected to
preserve quality, and which ones may be skipped. We then train a lightweight
classifier based on existing LLM embeddings to predict, at inference time,
which mismatching tokens can be safely accepted without compromising the final
answer quality. We test our approach with Llama 3.2 1B (draft) and Llama 3.1 8B
(target) models on zero-shot GSM8K reasoning, where it achieves up to 1.5x more
accepted tokens per verification cycle with under 1% degradation in answer
accuracy compared to standard speculative decoding and over 2x with small loss
in accuracy. When applied to the LiveCodeBench benchmark, our approach
automatically detects other, programming-specific important tokens and shows
similar speedups, demonstrating its ability to generalize across tasks.

Motivation: 当前的大型视觉语言模型在知识中心评估中表现优异，但缺乏对基础数学和视觉概念推理能力的评估。

Method: 提出VCBENCH基准，包含1,720个问题和6,697张图像，覆盖六个认知领域，要求多图像推理。

Result: 评估26个先进模型，发现性能差距显著，最高准确率不足50%。

Conclusion: 视觉数学整合仍具挑战，VCBENCH为未来模型改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
significantly enhanced their ability to integrate visual and linguistic
information, achieving near-human proficiency in tasks like object recognition,
captioning, and visual question answering. However, current benchmarks
typically focus on knowledge-centric evaluations that assess domain-specific
expertise, often neglecting the core ability to reason about fundamental
mathematical elements and visual concepts. We identify a gap in evaluating
elementary-level math problems, which rely on explicit visual
dependencies-requiring models to discern, integrate, and reason across multiple
images while incorporating commonsense knowledge, all of which are crucial for
advancing toward broader AGI capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce
VCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal mathematical reasoning with
explicit visual dependencies. VCBENCH includes 1,720 problems across six
cognitive domains, featuring 6,697 images (averaging 3.9 per question) to
ensure multi-image reasoning. We evaluate 26 state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCBENCH,
revealing substantial performance disparities, with even the top models unable
to exceed 50% accuracy. Our findings highlight the ongoing challenges in
visual-mathematical integration and suggest avenues for future LVLM
advancements.

Conclusion: active-DeepFA在标签稀缺场景下高效且性能优越，显著降低了标注成本。

Abstract: A major challenge that prevents the training of DL models is the limited
availability of accurately labeled data. This shortcoming is highlighted in
areas where data annotation becomes a time-consuming and error-prone task. In
this regard, SSL tackles this challenge by capitalizing on scarce labeled and
abundant unlabeled data; however, SoTA methods typically depend on pre-trained
features and large validation sets to learn effective representations for
classification tasks. In addition, the reduced set of labeled data is often
randomly sampled, neglecting the selection of more informative samples. Here,
we present active-DeepFA, a method that effectively combines CL,
teacher-student-based meta-pseudo-labeling and AL to train non-pretrained CNN
architectures for image classification in scenarios of scarcity of labeled and
abundance of unlabeled data. It integrates DeepFA into a co-training setup that
implements two cooperative networks to mitigate confirmation bias from
pseudo-labels. The method starts with a reduced set of labeled samples by
warming up the networks with supervised CL. Afterward and at regular epoch
intervals, label propagation is performed on the 2D projections of the
networks' deep features. Next, the most reliable pseudo-labels are exchanged
between networks in a cross-training fashion, while the most meaningful samples
are annotated and added into the labeled set. The networks independently
minimize an objective loss function comprising supervised contrastive,
supervised and semi-supervised loss components, enhancing the representations
towards image classification. Our approach is evaluated on three challenging
biological image datasets using only 5% of labeled samples, improving baselines
and outperforming six other SoTA methods. In addition, it reduces annotation
effort by achieving comparable results to those of its counterparts with only
3% of labeled data.

Motivation: 机器人需要理解和定位3D场景中的对象，但场景多样性、对象细粒度以及语言的自由形式引用使得任务复杂，且3D领域的自然语言训练数据稀缺。

Method: SORT3D结合2D数据的对象属性、启发式空间推理工具箱和LLMs的序列推理能力，无需文本到3D的训练数据。

Conclusion: SORT3D是一种高效的方法，能够在数据稀缺的情况下实现零样本泛化，适用于复杂3D场景中的对象定位任务。

Abstract: Interpreting object-referential language and grounding objects in 3D with
spatial relations and attributes is essential for robots operating alongside
humans. However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes,
large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language
references. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural
language training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn
from little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these
challenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes
from 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the
ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning.
Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can
be applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two
benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on an autonomous
vehicle and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal
navigation on previously unseen real-world environments. All source code for
the system pipeline is publicly released at https://github.com/nzantout/SORT3D .

Abstract: Video summarization creates an abridged version (i.e., a summary) that
provides a quick overview of the video while retaining pertinent information.
In this work, we focus on summarizing instructional videos and propose a method
for breaking down a video into meaningful segments, each corresponding to
essential steps in the video. We propose \textbf{HierSum}, a hierarchical
approach that integrates fine-grained local cues from subtitles with global
contextual information provided by video-level instructions. Our approach
utilizes the ``most replayed" statistic as a supervisory signal to identify
critical segments, thereby improving the effectiveness of the summary. We
evaluate on benchmark datasets such as TVSum, BLiSS, Mr.HiSum, and the WikiHow
test set, and show that HierSum consistently outperforms existing methods in
key metrics such as F1-score and rank correlation. We also curate a new
multi-modal dataset using WikiHow and EHow videos and associated articles
containing step-by-step instructions. Through extensive ablation studies, we
demonstrate that training on this dataset significantly enhances summarization
on the target datasets.

Abstract: This review provides a systematic analysis of comprehensive survey of 3D
object detection with vision-language models(VLMs) , a rapidly advancing area
at the intersection of 3D vision and multimodal AI. By examining over 100

open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot generalization. We review key
architectures, pretraining strategies, and prompt engineering methods that
align textual and 3D features for effective 3D object detection with

discussed to illustrate performance and behavior. Finally, we highlight current

Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练和测试数据同分布时表现良好，但OOD检测仍具挑战性。现有方法在特征空间生成离群点，但缺乏可视化支持。

Method: 使用扩散模型在像素空间生成对象级离群点，用于训练目标检测器进行OOD检测。

Result: Dream-Box在OOD检测性能上与传统方法相当，并首次提供了生成的OOD对象的具体可视化。

Conclusion: Dream-Box为OOD检测提供了一种新的方法，结合了性能与可视化优势，填补了像素空间对象级离群点生成的空白。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated great generalization capabilities for
tasks whose training and test sets are drawn from the same distribution.
Nevertheless, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains a challenging task
that has received significant attention in recent years. Specifically, OOD
detection refers to the detection of instances that do not belong to the
training distribution, while still having good performance on the
in-distribution task (e.g., classification or object detection). Recent work
has focused on generating synthetic outliers and using them to train an outlier
detector, generally achieving improved OOD detection than traditional OOD
methods. In this regard, outliers can be generated either in feature or pixel
space. Feature space driven methods have shown strong performance on both the
classification and object detection tasks, at the expense that the
visualization of training outliers remains unknown, making further analysis on
OOD failure modes challenging. On the other hand, pixel space outlier
generation techniques enabled by diffusion models have been used for image
classification using, providing improved OOD detection performance and outlier
visualization, although their adaption to the object detection task is as yet
unexplored. We therefore introduce Dream-Box, a method that provides a link to
object-wise outlier generation in the pixel space for OOD detection.
Specifically, we use diffusion models to generate object-wise outliers that are
used to train an object detector for an in-distribution task and OOD detection.
Our method achieves comparable performance to previous traditional methods
while being the first technique to provide concrete visualization of generated
OOD objects.

Motivation: 手术工作流中的动作理解对术后评估至关重要，但由于外科医生操作习惯的多样性和动作边界的模糊性，传统方法难以准确分割。

Method: 采用多阶段边界感知Transformer网络（MSBATN），结合分层滑动窗口注意力和统一的损失函数，将动作分类与边界检测作为相互依赖的任务处理。

Result: 在三个手术数据集上的实验表明，MSBATN在F1分数上达到最先进水平，尤其在25%和50%阈值下表现优异。

Conclusion: MSBATN通过创新的边界投票机制和统一损失函数，显著提升了动作分割的准确性，为手术视频分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Understanding actions within surgical workflows is essential for evaluating
post-operative outcomes. However, capturing long sequences of actions performed
in surgical settings poses challenges, as individual surgeons have their unique
approaches shaped by their expertise, leading to significant variability. To
tackle this complex problem, we focused on segmentation with precise
boundaries, a demanding task due to the inherent variability in action
durations and the subtle transitions often observed in untrimmed videos. These
transitions, marked by ambiguous starting and ending points, complicate the
segmentation process. Traditional models, such as MS-TCN, which depend on large
receptive fields, frequently face challenges of over-segmentation (resulting in
fragmented segments) or under-segmentation (merging distinct actions). Both of
these issues negatively impact the quality of segmentation. To overcome these
challenges, we present the Multi-Stage Boundary-Aware Transformer Network
(MSBATN) with hierarchical sliding window attention, designed to enhance action
segmentation. Our proposed approach incorporates a novel unified loss function
that treats action classification and boundary detection as distinct yet
interdependent tasks. Unlike traditional binary boundary detection methods, our
boundary voting mechanism accurately identifies start and end points by
leveraging contextual information. Extensive experiments using three
challenging surgical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art results in F1 scores at thresholds
of 25% and 50%, while also delivering comparable performance in other metrics.

mechanism by visualization of the attention scores and the models applicability

Abstract: The perception of vehicles and pedestrians in urban scenarios is crucial for
autonomous driving. This process typically involves complicated data
collection, imposes high computational and hardware demands. To address these
limitations, we first develop a highly efficient method for generating virtual
datasets, which enables the creation of task- and scenario-specific datasets in
a short time. Leveraging this method, we construct the virtual depth estimation
dataset VirDepth, a large-scale, multi-task autonomous driving dataset.
Subsequently, we propose CenterDepth, a lightweight architecture for monocular
depth estimation that ensures high operational efficiency and exhibits superior
performance in depth estimation tasks with highly imbalanced height-scale
distributions. CenterDepth integrates global semantic information through the
innovative Center FC-CRFs algorithm, aggregates multi-scale features based on
object key points, and enables detection-based depth estimation of targets.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance
in terms of both computational speed and prediction accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具无法捕获IoT网络流数据包的序列和空间模式，限制了Transformer模型的应用。

Method: 从.pcap文件提取特征并转换为1通道2D图像形状，扩展ViT以支持多种分类器（如DNN、LSTM、BLSTM）。

Result: 在两种IoT攻击数据集上，DNN、LSTM和BLSTM模型在精确率、召回率和F1分数上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将ViT模型应用于IoT攻击检测，并展示了多种分类器的竞争力。

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of transformer models in NLP, and
image and video classification, the available tools for extracting features
from captured IoT network flow packets fail to capture sequential patterns in
addition to the absence of spatial patterns consequently limiting transformer
model application. This work introduces a novel preprocessing method to adapt
transformer models, the vision transformer (ViT) in particular, for IoT botnet
attack detection using network flow packets. The approach involves feature
extraction from .pcap files and transforming each instance into a 1-channel 2D
image shape, enabling ViT-based classification. Also, the ViT model was
enhanced to allow use any classifier besides Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) that
was deployed in the initial ViT paper. Models including the conventional feed
forward Deep Neural Network (DNN), LSTM and Bidirectional-LSTM (BLSTM)
demonstrated competitive performance in terms of precision, recall, and
F1-score for multiclass-based attack detection when evaluated on two IoT attack
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标注成本高和隐私保护问题，研究者通常依赖合成数据进行预训练和微调，但这些数据存在领域偏差，限制了预训练模型的可扩展性。

Method: 开发了一系列反映真实场景多样性和复杂性的任务，并引入动态错误样本记忆单元记录多任务中的错误历史。同时采用自适应双速更新策略，平衡新任务的快速适应和历史任务的慢速权重更新。

Result: 模型在真实世界基准测试（如CUHK-PEDES、ICFG-PEDES和RSTPReid）上超越了现有最优方法，并在处理有偏合成图像和噪声文本标注时表现出鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: CAMeL框架不仅提升了模型性能，还展示了在处理领域偏差和噪声数据时的优越性。

Abstract: Text-based person retrieval aims to identify specific individuals within an
image database using textual descriptions. Due to the high cost of annotation
and privacy protection, researchers resort to synthesized data for the paradigm
of pretraining and fine-tuning. However, these generated data often exhibit
domain biases in both images and textual annotations, which largely compromise
the scalability of the pre-trained model. Therefore, we introduce a
domain-agnostic pretraining framework based on Cross-modality Adaptive
Meta-Learning (CAMeL) to enhance the model generalization capability during
pretraining to facilitate the subsequent downstream tasks. In particular, we
develop a series of tasks that reflect the diversity and complexity of
real-world scenarios, and introduce a dynamic error sample memory unit to
memorize the history for errors encountered within multiple tasks. To further
ensure multi-task adaptation, we also adopt an adaptive dual-speed update
strategy, balancing fast adaptation to new tasks and slow weight updates for
historical tasks. Albeit simple, our proposed model not only surpasses existing
state-of-the-art methods on real-world benchmarks, including CUHK-PEDES,
ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid, but also showcases robustness and scalability in
handling biased synthetic images and noisy text annotations. Our code is

Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）多依赖单帧图像输入，导致对通过心脏运动识别的病症诊断准确性较低，且未充分利用多视角信息。

Method: 开发了一种视频-语言模型，输入五种不同视角的完整视频序列，并在60,747例超声心动图视频和临床报告对上训练。

Result: 实验表明，该模型比单视角视频或静态图像训练的模型具有更高的诊断准确性。

Conclusion: 多视角视频输入的视频-语言模型能显著提升超声心动图诊断的准确性。

Abstract: Echocardiography involves recording videos of the heart using ultrasound,
enabling clinicians to evaluate its condition. Recent advances in large-scale
vision-language models (VLMs) have garnered attention for automating the
interpretation of echocardiographic videos. However, most existing VLMs
proposed for medical interpretation thus far rely on single-frame (i.e., image)
inputs. Consequently, these image-based models often exhibit lower diagnostic
accuracy for conditions identifiable through cardiac motion. Moreover,
echocardiographic videos are recorded from various views that depend on the
direction of ultrasound emission, and certain views are more suitable than
others for interpreting specific conditions. Incorporating multiple views could
potentially yield further improvements in accuracy. In this study, we developed
a video-language model that takes five different views and full video sequences
as input, training it on pairs of echocardiographic videos and clinical reports
from 60,747 cases. Our experiments demonstrate that this expanded approach
achieves higher interpretation accuracy than models trained with only
single-view videos or with still images.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在说话人脸视频生成中实现了高保真度和音频-唇同步。

Conclusion: JULNet通过联合学习误差和不确定性，显著提升了生成视频的质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Talking face video generation with arbitrary speech audio is a significant
challenge within the realm of digital human technology. The previous studies
have emphasized the significance of audio-lip synchronization and visual
quality. Currently, limited attention has been given to the learning of visual
uncertainty, which creates several issues in existing systems, including
inconsistent visual quality and unreliable performance across different input
conditions. To address the problem, we propose a Joint Uncertainty Learning
Network (JULNet) for high-quality talking face video generation, which
incorporates a representation of uncertainty that is directly related to visual
error. Specifically, we first design an uncertainty module to individually
predict the error map and uncertainty map after obtaining the generated image.
The error map represents the difference between the generated image and the
ground truth image, while the uncertainty map is used to predict the
probability of incorrect estimates. Furthermore, to match the uncertainty
distribution with the error distribution through a KL divergence term, we
introduce a histogram technique to approximate the distributions. By jointly
optimizing error and uncertainty, the performance and robustness of our model
can be enhanced. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
superior high-fidelity and audio-lip synchronization in talking face video
generation compared to previous methods.

Abstract: In Computational Pathology (CPath), the introduction of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) has opened new avenues for research, focusing primarily on
aligning image-text pairs at a single magnification level. However, this
approach might not be sufficient for tasks like cancer subtype classification,
tissue phenotyping, and survival analysis due to the limited level of detail
that a single-resolution image can provide. Addressing this, we propose a novel
multi-resolution paradigm leveraging Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to extract
histology patches at multiple resolutions and generate corresponding textual
descriptions through advanced CPath VLM. We introduce visual-textual alignment
at multiple resolutions as well as cross-resolution alignment to establish more
effective text-guided visual representations. Cross-resolution alignment using
a multimodal encoder enhances the model's ability to capture context from
multiple resolutions in histology images. Our model aims to capture a broader
range of information, supported by novel loss functions, enriches feature
representation, improves discriminative ability, and enhances generalization
across different resolutions. Pre-trained on a comprehensive TCGA dataset with
34 million image-language pairs at various resolutions, our fine-tuned model
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) counterparts across multiple datasets and
tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in CPath. The code is available on

Abstract: The need for accurate and non-intrusive flow measurement methods has led to
the widespread adoption of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), a powerful
diagnostic tool in fluid motion estimation. This study investigates the
tremendous potential of spike cameras (a type of ultra-high-speed,
high-dynamic-range camera) in PIV. We propose a deep learning framework, Spike
Imaging Velocimetry (SIV), designed specifically for highly turbulent and
intricate flow fields. To aggregate motion features from the spike stream while
minimizing information loss, we incorporate a Detail-Preserving Hierarchical
Transform (DPHT) module. Additionally, we introduce a Graph Encoder (GE) to
extract contextual features from highly complex fluid flows. Furthermore, we
present a spike-based PIV dataset, Particle Scenes with Spike and Displacement
(PSSD), which provides labeled data for three challenging fluid dynamics
scenarios. Our proposed method achieves superior performance compared to
existing baseline methods on PSSD. The datasets and our implementation of SIV
are open-sourced in the supplementary materials.

Motivation: 现有弱监督视频暴力检测方法依赖欧几里得表示学习，难以区分视觉相似但语义不同的事件，且模糊训练样本不足。

Method: 提出双空间学习框架PiercingEye，结合欧几里得和双曲几何，引入层敏感双曲聚合策略和跨空间注意力机制，并利用大语言模型生成模糊样本进行监督。

Result: 在XD-Violence和UCF-Crime基准测试中达到最优性能，尤其在模糊事件子集上表现突出。

Conclusion: PiercingEye通过双空间学习和模糊样本增强，显著提升了细粒度暴力检测能力。

Abstract: Existing weakly supervised video violence detection (VVD) methods primarily
rely on Euclidean representation learning, which often struggles to distinguish
visually similar yet semantically distinct events due to limited hierarchical
modeling and insufficient ambiguous training samples. To address this
challenge, we propose PiercingEye, a novel dual-space learning framework that
synergizes Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries to enhance discriminative
feature representation. Specifically, PiercingEye introduces a layer-sensitive
hyperbolic aggregation strategy with hyperbolic Dirichlet energy constraints to
progressively model event hierarchies, and a cross-space attention mechanism to
facilitate complementary feature interactions between Euclidean and hyperbolic
spaces. Furthermore, to mitigate the scarcity of ambiguous samples, we leverage
large language models to generate logic-guided ambiguous event descriptions,
enabling explicit supervision through a hyperbolic vision-language contrastive
loss that prioritizes high-confusion samples via dynamic similarity-aware
weighting. Extensive experiments on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmarks
demonstrate that PiercingEye achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
particularly strong results on a newly curated ambiguous event subset,
validating its superior capability in fine-grained violence detection.

Abstract: As an essential component of logistics automation, the automated loading
system is becoming a critical technology for enhancing operational efficiency
and safety. Precise automatic positioning of the truck compartment, which
serves as the loading area, is the primary step in automated loading. However,
existing methods have difficulty adapting to truck compartments of various
sizes, do not establish a unified coordinate system for LiDAR and mobile
manipulators, and often exhibit reliability issues in cluttered environments.
To address these limitations, our study focuses on achieving precise automatic
positioning of key points in large, medium, and small fence-style truck
compartments in cluttered scenarios. We propose an innovative wide
field-of-view 3-D LiDAR vehicle compartment automatic localization system. For
vehicles of various sizes, this system leverages the LiDAR to generate
high-density point clouds within an extensive field-of-view range. By
incorporating parking area constraints, our vehicle point cloud segmentation
method more effectively segments vehicle point clouds within the scene. Our
compartment key point positioning algorithm utilizes the geometric features of
the compartments to accurately locate the corner points, providing stackable
spatial regions. Extensive experiments on our collected data and public
datasets demonstrate that this system offers reliable positioning accuracy and
reduced computational resource consumption, leading to its application and
promotion in relevant fields.

Abstract: 3D face reconstruction (3DFR) algorithms are based on specific assumptions
tailored to the limits and characteristics of the different application
scenarios. In this study, we investigate how multiple state-of-the-art 3DFR
algorithms can be used to generate a better representation of subjects, with
the final goal of improving the performance of face recognition systems in
challenging uncontrolled scenarios. We also explore how different parametric
and non-parametric score-level fusion methods can exploit the unique strengths
of multiple 3DFR algorithms to enhance biometric recognition robustness. With
this goal, we propose a comprehensive analysis of several face recognition
systems across diverse conditions, such as varying distances and camera setups,
intra-dataset and cross-dataset, to assess the robustness of the proposed
ensemble method. The results demonstrate that the distinct information provided
by different 3DFR algorithms can alleviate the problem of generalizing over
multiple application scenarios. In addition, the present study highlights the
potential of advanced fusion strategies to enhance the reliability of
3DFR-based face recognition systems, providing the research community with key
insights to exploit them in real-world applications effectively. Although the
experiments are carried out in a specific face verification setup, our proposed
fusion-based 3DFR methods may be applied to other tasks around face biometrics
that are not strictly related to identity recognition.

Abstract: Unauthorized screen capturing and dissemination pose severe security threats
such as data leakage and information theft. Several studies propose robust
watermarking methods to track the copyright of Screen-Camera (SC) images,
facilitating post-hoc certification against infringement. These techniques
typically employ heuristic mathematical modeling or supervised neural network
fitting as the noise layer, to enhance watermarking robustness against SC.
However, both strategies cannot fundamentally achieve an effective
approximation of SC noise. Mathematical simulation suffers from biased
approximations due to the incomplete decomposition of the noise and the absence
of interdependence among the noise components. Supervised networks require
paired data to train the noise-fitting model, and it is difficult for the model
to learn all the features of the noise. To address the above issues, we propose
Simulation-to-Real (S2R). Specifically, an unsupervised noise layer employs
unpaired data to learn the discrepancy between the modeling simulated noise
distribution and the real-world SC noise distribution, rather than directly
learning the mapping from sharp images to real-world images. Learning this
transformation from simulation to reality is inherently simpler, as it
primarily involves bridging the gap in noise distributions, instead of the
complex task of reconstructing fine-grained image details. Extensive
experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed method,
demonstrating superior watermark robustness and generalization compared to
those of state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We introduce R-Sparse R-CNN, a novel pipeline for oriented ship detection in
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images that leverages sparse learnable proposals
enriched with background contextual information, termed background-aware
proposals (BAPs). The adoption of sparse proposals streamlines the pipeline by
eliminating the need for proposal generators and post-processing for
overlapping predictions. The proposed BAPs enrich object representation by
integrating ship and background features, allowing the model to learn their
contextual relationships for more accurate distinction of ships in complex
environments. To complement BAPs, we propose Dual-Context Pooling (DCP), a
novel strategy that jointly extracts ship and background features in a single
unified operation. This unified design improves efficiency by eliminating
redundant computation inherent in separate pooling. Moreover, by ensuring that
ship and background features are pooled from the same feature map level, DCP
provides aligned features that improve contextual relationship learning.
Finally, as a core component of contextual relationship learning in R-Sparse
R-CNN, we design a dedicated transformer-based Interaction Module. This module
interacts pooled ship and background features with corresponding proposal
features and models their relationships. Experimental results show that
R-Sparse R-CNN delivers outstanding accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art
models by margins of up to 12.8% and 11.9% on SSDD and RSDD-SAR inshore
datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and
competitiveness of R-Sparse R-CNN as a robust framework for oriented ship
detection in SAR imagery. The code is available at:

Abstract: Convolutional neural network (CNN) slides a kernel over the whole image to
produce an output map. This kernel scheme reduces the number of parameters with
respect to a fully connected neural network (NN). While CNN has proven to be an
effective model in recognition of handwritten characters and traffic signal
sign boards, etc. recently, its deep variants have proven to be effective in
similar as well as more challenging applications like object, scene and action
recognition. Deep CNN add more layers and kernels to the classical CNN,
increasing the number of parameters, and partly reducing the main advantage of
CNN which is less parameters. In this paper, a 3D pyramidal neural network
called 3DPyraNet and a discriminative approach for spatio-temporal feature
learning based on it, called 3DPyraNet-F, are proposed. 3DPyraNet introduces a
new weighting scheme which learns features from both spatial and temporal
dimensions analyzing multiple adjacent frames and keeping a biological
plausible structure. It keeps the spatial topology of the input image and
presents fewer parameters and lower computational and memory costs compared to
both fully connected NNs and recent deep CNNs. 3DPyraNet-F extract the features
maps of the highest layer of the learned network, fuse them in a single vector,
and provide it as input in such a way to a linear-SVM classifier that enhances
the recognition of human actions and dynamic scenes from the videos.
Encouraging results are reported with 3DPyraNet in real-world environments,
especially in the presence of camera induced motion. Further, 3DPyraNet-F
clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets and shows
comparable result for the fourth.

Abstract: Data augmentation is essential in medical imaging for improving
classification accuracy, lesion detection, and organ segmentation under limited

pronounced domain gap between natural photographs and medical images can
distort critical disease features. Second, augmentation studies in medical
imaging are fragmented and limited to single tasks or architectures, leaving
the benefits of advanced mix-based strategies unclear. To address these

VISUALCENTs accuracy and real time performance advantages, outperforming
existing methods in mAP scores and execution frame rate per second. The

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping art, gaming, and most notably animation. Recent
breakthroughs in foundation and diffusion models have reduced the time and cost
of producing animated content. Characters are central animation components,
involving motion, emotions, gestures, and facial expressions. The pace and

earlier overviews that treat avatars, gestures, or facial animation in
isolation, this survey offers a single, comprehensive perspective on all the
main generative AI applications for character animation. We begin by examining
the state-of-the-art in facial animation, expression rendering, image
synthesis, avatar creation, gesture modeling, motion synthesis, object
generation, and texture synthesis. We highlight leading research, practical
deployments, commonly used datasets, and emerging trends for each area. To
support newcomers, we also provide a comprehensive background section that
introduces foundational models and evaluation metrics, equipping readers with
the knowledge needed to enter the field. We discuss open challenges and map
future research directions, providing a roadmap to advance AI-driven
character-animation technologies. This survey is intended as a resource for
researchers and developers entering the field of generative AI animation or
adjacent fields. Resources are available at:

Motivation: 解决CNN在HSI分类中的高计算成本和有限泛化能力，以及域偏移问题。

Method: 采用双分支残差网络整合空间和光谱特征，引入调节项优化原型，并使用核概率匹配策略对齐域特征。

Result: 在四个公开HSI数据集上表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了HSI分类性能，尤其在少样本和跨域场景中。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are effective for hyperspectral image
(HSI) classification, but their 3D convolutional structures introduce high
computational costs and limited generalization in few-shot scenarios. Domain
shifts caused by sensor differences and environmental variations further hinder
cross-dataset adaptability. Metric-based few-shot learning (FSL) prototype
networks mitigate this problem, yet their performance is sensitive to prototype
quality, especially with limited samples. To overcome these challenges, a
dual-branch residual network that integrates spatial and spectral features via
parallel branches is proposed in this letter. Additionally, more robust refined
prototypes are obtained through a regulation term. Furthermore, a kernel
probability matching strategy aligns source and target domain features,
alleviating domain shift. Experiments on four publicly available HSI datasets
illustrate that the proposal achieves superior performance compared to other
methods.

Result: 在五个AD数据集上，HoloDx表现优于现有方法，诊断准确性和泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: HoloDx通过结合领域知识和数据驱动方法，显著提升了AD诊断的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires effectively
integrating multimodal data and clinical expertise. However, existing methods
often struggle to fully utilize multimodal information and lack structured
mechanisms to incorporate dynamic domain knowledge. To address these
limitations, we propose HoloDx, a knowledge- and data-driven framework that
enhances AD diagnosis by aligning domain knowledge with multimodal clinical
data. HoloDx incorporates a knowledge injection module with a knowledge-aware
gated cross-attention, allowing the model to dynamically integrate
domain-specific insights from both large language models (LLMs) and clinical
expertise. Also, a memory injection module with a designed prototypical memory
attention enables the model to retain and retrieve subject-specific
information, ensuring consistency in decision-making. By jointly leveraging
these mechanisms, HoloDx enhances interpretability, improves robustness, and
effectively aligns prior knowledge with current subject data. Evaluations on
five AD datasets demonstrate that HoloDx outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior diagnostic accuracy and strong generalization across diverse
cohorts. The source code will be released upon publication acceptance.

Abstract: Most self-driving systems rely on hand-coded perception outputs and

end-to-end method can allow for a training architecture that is simpler and
scales well with compute and data.
  In this work, we propose an end-to-end training architecture that uses real
driving data to train a driving policy in an on-policy simulator. We show two
different methods of simulation, one with reprojective simulation and one with
a learned world model. We show that both methods can be used to train a policy
that learns driving behavior without any hand-coded driving rules. We evaluate
the performance of these policies in a closed-loop simulation and when deployed
in a real-world advanced driver-assistance system.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have significantly advanced deep learning by enhancing
feature representation through selective focus. However, existing approaches
often independently model channel importance and spatial saliency, overlooking
their inherent interdependence and limiting their effectiveness. To address
this limitation, we propose MIA-Mind, a lightweight and modular
Multidimensional Interactive Attention Mechanism, built upon the MindSpore
framework. MIA-Mind jointly models spatial and channel features through a
unified cross-attentive fusion strategy, enabling fine-grained feature
recalibration with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments are
conducted on three representative datasets: on CIFAR-10, MIA-Mind achieves an
accuracy of 82.9\%; on ISBI2012, it achieves an accuracy of 78.7\%; and on
CIC-IDS2017, it achieves an accuracy of 91.9\%. These results validate the
versatility, lightweight design, and generalization ability of MIA-Mind across
heterogeneous tasks. Future work will explore the extension of MIA-Mind to
large-scale datasets, the development of ada,ptive attention fusion strategies,

Result: 在S-DGOD基准数据集上取得新最优结果，Cityscapes-C和DWD分别提升8.8%和7.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过细粒度跨模态交互和域适应策略，显著提升了S-DGOD任务的性能。

Abstract: Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection~(S-DGOD) aims to train an object
detector on a single source domain while generalizing well to diverse unseen
target domains, making it suitable for multimedia applications that involve
various domain shifts, such as intelligent video surveillance and VR/AR
technologies. With the success of large-scale Vision-Language Models, recent
S-DGOD approaches exploit pre-trained vision-language knowledge to guide
invariant feature learning across visual domains. However, the utilized
knowledge remains at a coarse-grained level~(e.g., the textual description of
adverse weather paired with the image) and serves as an implicit regularization
for guidance, struggling to learn accurate region- and object-level features in
varying domains. In this work, we propose a new cross-modal feature learning
method, which can capture generalized and discriminative regional features for
S-DGOD tasks. The core of our method is the mechanism of Cross-modal and
Region-aware Feature Interaction, which simultaneously learns both inter-modal
and intra-modal regional invariance through dynamic interactions between
fine-grained textual and visual features. Moreover, we design a simple but
effective strategy called Cross-domain Proposal Refining and Mixing, which
aligns the position of region proposals across multiple domains and diversifies
them, enhancing the localization ability of detectors in unseen scenarios. Our
method achieves new state-of-the-art results on S-DGOD benchmark datasets, with
improvements of +8.8\%~mPC on Cityscapes-C and +7.9\%~mPC on DWD over
baselines, demonstrating its efficacy.

Result: 在Jetson AGX Orin上，LASP的在线性能接近离线评估的80%，无需加速技术。

Conclusion: LASP框架能有效解决3D感知在边缘设备上的延迟问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Although existing 3D perception algorithms have demonstrated significant
improvements in performance, their deployment on edge devices continues to
encounter critical challenges due to substantial runtime latency. We propose a
new benchmark tailored for online evaluation by considering runtime latency.
Based on the benchmark, we build a Latency-Aware 3D Streaming Perception (LASP)
framework that addresses the latency issue through two primary components: 1)
latency-aware history integration, which extends query propagation into a
continuous process, ensuring the integration of historical feature regardless
of varying latency; 2) latency-aware predictive detection, a module that
compensates the detection results with the predicted trajectory and the
posterior accessed latency. By incorporating the latency-aware mechanism, our
method shows generalization across various latency levels, achieving an online
performance that closely aligns with 80\% of its offline evaluation on the
Jetson AGX Orin without any acceleration techniques.

Conclusion: 稀疏性方法在BSS中具有潜力，改进的块稀疏字典学习算法进一步提升了性能，为实际应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Blind source separation (BSS) is a key technique in array processing and data
analysis, aiming to recover unknown sources from observed mixtures without
knowledge of the mixing matrix. Classical independent component analysis (ICA)
methods rely on the assumption that sources are mutually independent. To
address limitations of ICA, sparsity-based methods have been introduced, which
decompose source signals sparsely in a predefined dictionary. Morphological
Component Analysis (MCA), based on sparse representation theory, assumes that a
signal is a linear combination of components with distinct geometries, each
sparsely representable in one dictionary and not in others. This approach has
recently been applied to BSS with promising results.
  This report reviews key approaches derived from classical ICA and explores
sparsity-based methods for BSS. It introduces the theory of sparse
representation and decomposition, followed by a block coordinate relaxation MCA
algorithm, whose variants are used in Multichannel MCA (MMCA) and Generalized
MCA (GMCA). A local dictionary learning method using K-SVD is then presented.
Finally, we propose an improved algorithm, SAC+BK-SVD, which enhances K-SVD by
learning a block-sparsifying dictionary that clusters and updates similar atoms
in blocks.
  The implementation includes experiments on image segmentation and blind image
source separation using the discussed techniques. We also compare the proposed
block-sparse dictionary learning algorithm with K-SVD. Simulation results
demonstrate that our method yields improved blind image separation quality.

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeepSPG通过引入语义先验和多模态学习，显著提升了低光图像增强的效果。

Abstract: There has long been a belief that high-level semantics learning can benefit
various downstream computer vision tasks. However, in the low-light image
enhancement (LLIE) community, existing methods learn a brutal mapping between
low-light and normal-light domains without considering the semantic information
of different regions, especially in those extremely dark regions that suffer
from severe information loss. To address this issue, we propose a new deep
semantic prior-guided framework (DeepSPG) based on Retinex image decomposition
for LLIE to explore informative semantic knowledge via a pre-trained semantic
segmentation model and multimodal learning. Notably, we incorporate both
image-level semantic prior and text-level semantic prior and thus formulate a
multimodal learning framework with combinatorial deep semantic prior guidance
for LLIE. Specifically, we incorporate semantic knowledge to guide the
enhancement process via three designs: an image-level semantic prior guidance
by leveraging hierarchical semantic features from a pre-trained semantic
segmentation model; a text-level semantic prior guidance by integrating natural
language semantic constraints via a pre-trained vision-language model; a
multi-scale semantic-aware structure that facilitates effective semantic
feature incorporation. Eventually, our proposed DeepSPG demonstrates superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark
datasets. The implementation details and code are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAR与RGB图像融合中模态异质性和光谱互补性未充分利用的问题。

Method: PAD框架在傅里叶域分离相位（模态共享）和振幅（模态特定）成分，包括相位谱校正（PSC）和振幅谱融合（ASF）。

Result: 在WHU-OPT-SAR和DDHR-SK数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PAD为遥感中的物理感知多模态融合建立了新范式。

Abstract: The fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and RGB imagery for land cover
classification remains challenging due to modality heterogeneity and the
underutilization of spectral complementarity. Existing methods often fail to
decouple shared structural features from modality-specific radiometric
attributes, leading to feature conflicts and information loss. To address this
issue, we propose Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework
that separates phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-specific)
components in the Fourier domain. Specifically, PAD consists of two key
components: 1) Phase Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase
features through convolution-guided scaling to enhance geometric consistency,
and 2) Amplitude Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates
high-frequency details and low-frequency structures using frequency-adaptive
multilayer perceptrons. This approach leverages SAR's sensitivity to
morphological features and RGB's spectral richness. Extensive experiments on
WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our
work establishes a new paradigm for physics-aware multi-modal fusion in remote
sensing. The code will be available at https://github.com/RanFeng2/PAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出RadioFormer，一种多粒度Transformer模型，用于解决无线电地图估计中空间稀疏观测的挑战，通过双流自注意力和跨流交叉注意力模块实现高效建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度视觉模型（如U-Net）在无线电地图估计中需要足够空间观测（0.01%到1%像素），而实际场景中观测可能极度稀疏，因此需要更高效的模型。

Method: 提出RadioFormer，通过双流自注意力（DSA）模块分别建模像素级信号功率相关性和块级建筑物几何特征，并通过跨流交叉注意力（CCA）模块整合多尺度表示。

Result: 在RadioMapSeer数据集上，RadioFormer优于现有方法，计算成本最低，并展现出优异的泛化能力和零样本性能。

Conclusion: RadioFormer在极稀疏观测下表现出色，为无线电地图估计提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The task of radio map estimation aims to generate a dense representation of
electromagnetic spectrum quantities, such as the received signal strength at
each grid point within a geographic region, based on measurements from a subset
of spatially distributed nodes (represented as pixels). Recently, deep vision
models such as the U-Net have been adapted to radio map estimation, whose
effectiveness can be guaranteed with sufficient spatial observations (typically
0.01% to 1% of pixels) in each map, to model local dependency of observed
signal power. However, such a setting of sufficient measurements can be less
practical in real-world scenarios, where extreme sparsity in spatial sampling
can be widely encountered. To address this challenge, we propose RadioFormer, a
novel multiple-granularity transformer designed to handle the constraints posed
by spatial sparse observations. Our RadioFormer, through a dual-stream
self-attention (DSA) module, can respectively discover the correlation of
pixel-wise observed signal power and also learn patch-wise buildings'
geometries in a style of multiple granularities, which are integrated into
multi-scale representations of radio maps by a cross stream cross-attention
(CCA) module. Extensive experiments on the public RadioMapSeer dataset
demonstrate that RadioFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in radio map
estimation while maintaining the lowest computational cost. Furthermore, the
proposed approach exhibits exceptional generalization capabilities and robust
zero-shot performance, underscoring its potential to advance radio map
estimation in a more practical setting with very limited observation nodes.

Motivation: 现有方法通常需要额外阶段或联合优化来重建3D表示（如NeRF或3D高斯），效率较低。本文旨在通过单次去噪过程直接生成最终输出，提升效率。

Method: 通过生成多平面图像（MPIs）确保几何一致性，并引入训练机制在目标或参考相机空间中随机重建MPI，以同时学习图像细节和3D信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在头像质量和新视角渲染能力上具有竞争力，无需显式3D重建或高质量多视角数据。

Conclusion: 该方法通过单次去噪过程高效生成逼真视频，适用于VR等沉浸式体验。

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D-aware diffusion-based method for generating
photorealistic talking head videos directly from a single identity image and
explicit control signals (e.g., expressions). Our method generates Multiplane
Images (MPIs) that ensure geometric consistency, making them ideal for
immersive viewing experiences like binocular videos for VR headsets. Unlike
existing methods that often require a separate stage or joint optimization to
reconstruct a 3D representation (such as NeRF or 3D Gaussians), our approach
directly generates the final output through a single denoising process,
eliminating the need for post-processing steps to render novel views
efficiently. To effectively learn from monocular videos, we introduce a
training mechanism that reconstructs the output MPI randomly in either the
target or the reference camera space. This approach enables the model to
simultaneously learn sharp image details and underlying 3D information.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which
achieves competitive avatar quality and novel-view rendering capabilities, even
without explicit 3D reconstruction or high-quality multi-view training data.

Abstract: With the emergence of transformer-based architectures and large language
models (LLMs), the accuracy of road scene perception has substantially
advanced. Nonetheless, current road scene segmentation approaches are
predominantly trained on closed-set data, resulting in insufficient detection
capabilities for out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. To overcome this
limitation, road anomaly detection methods have been proposed. However,
existing methods primarily depend on image inpainting and OOD distribution
detection techniques, facing two critical issues: (1) inadequate consideration
of the objectiveness attributes of anomalous regions, causing incomplete
segmentation when anomalous objects share similarities with known classes, and
(2) insufficient attention to environmental constraints, leading to the
detection of anomalies irrelevant to autonomous driving tasks. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework termed Segmenting Objectiveness and Task-Awareness
(SOTA) for autonomous driving scenes. Specifically, SOTA enhances the
segmentation of objectiveness through a Semantic Fusion Block (SFB) and filters
anomalies irrelevant to road navigation tasks using a Scene-understanding
Guided Prompt-Context Adaptor (SG-PCA). Extensive empirical evaluations on
multiple benchmark datasets, including Fishyscapes Lost and Found,
Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and RoadAnomaly, demonstrate that the proposed SOTA
consistently improves OOD detection performance across diverse detectors,
achieving robust and accurate segmentation outcomes.

Conclusion: LRFusionPR通过LiDAR和雷达的融合，显著提升了地点识别的性能，为自动驾驶提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, place recognition is critical for global localization
in GPS-denied environments. LiDAR and radar-based place recognition methods
have garnered increasing attention, as LiDAR provides precise ranging, whereas
radar excels in adverse weather resilience. However, effectively leveraging
LiDAR-radar fusion for place recognition remains challenging. The noisy and
sparse nature of radar data limits its potential to further improve recognition
accuracy. In addition, heterogeneous radar configurations complicate the
development of unified cross-modality fusion frameworks. In this paper, we
propose LRFusionPR, which improves recognition accuracy and robustness by
fusing LiDAR with either single-chip or scanning radar. Technically, a
dual-branch network is proposed to fuse different modalities within the unified
polar coordinate bird's eye view (BEV) representation. In the fusion branch,
cross-attention is utilized to perform cross-modality feature interactions. The
knowledge from the fusion branch is simultaneously transferred to the
distillation branch, which takes radar as its only input to further improve the
robustness. Ultimately, the descriptors from both branches are concatenated,
producing the multimodal global descriptor for place retrieval. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our LRFusionPR achieves
accurate place recognition, while maintaining robustness under varying weather
conditions. Our open-source code will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于空间-光谱双域自适应学习的水下图像增强方法（SS-UIE），通过空间多尺度循环选择性扫描模块（MCSS）和光谱自注意力模块（SWSA）结合，解决了现有方法在空间区域和光谱波段退化水平不一致及高频细节区域重建困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型水下图像增强方法未能同时考虑空间区域和光谱波段的退化水平不一致，且忽视高频细节区域的重建难度。

Method: 提出SS-UIE方法，结合MCSS和SWSA模块形成空间-光谱块（SS-block），并引入频率损失函数（FWL）强化高频细节区域的关注。

Result: 实验表明SS-UIE在性能和计算成本上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SS-UIE通过双域自适应学习和频率损失函数，有效提升了水下图像增强效果。

Abstract: Recently, learning-based Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) methods have
demonstrated promising performance. However, existing learning-based methods
still face two challenges. 1) They rarely consider the inconsistent degradation
levels in different spatial regions and spectral bands simultaneously. 2) They
treat all regions equally, ignoring that the regions with high-frequency
details are more difficult to reconstruct. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel UIE method based on spatial-spectral dual-domain adaptive
learning, termed SS-UIE. Specifically, we first introduce a spatial-wise
Multi-scale Cycle Selective Scan (MCSS) module and a Spectral-Wise
Self-Attention (SWSA) module, both with linear complexity, and combine them in
parallel to form a basic Spatial-Spectral block (SS-block). Benefiting from the
global receptive field of MCSS and SWSA, SS-block can effectively model the
degradation levels of different spatial regions and spectral bands, thereby
enabling degradation level-based dual-domain adaptive UIE. By stacking multiple
SS-blocks, we build our SS-UIE network. Additionally, a Frequency-Wise Loss
(FWL) is introduced to narrow the frequency-wise discrepancy and reinforce the
model's attention on the regions with high-frequency details. Extensive
experiments validate that the SS-UIE technique outperforms state-of-the-art UIE
methods while requiring cheaper computational and memory costs.

TLDR: FlexPara是一种无监督神经优化框架，用于实现全局和多图表的表面参数化，通过自适应变形的2D UV坐标与3D表面点之间的映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数化方法需要高质量的网格三角剖分，且仅限于简单拓扑结构，缺乏灵活性和可控性。

Method: 设计了一系列几何可解释的子网络，包括切割、变形、展开和包裹功能，构建双向循环映射框架。

Result: 实验证明了该神经表面参数化范式的通用性、优越性和潜力。

Conclusion: FlexPara提供了一种灵活且可控的表面参数化方法，无需手动指定切割缝。

Abstract: Surface parameterization is a fundamental geometry processing task, laying
the foundations for the visual presentation of 3D assets and numerous
downstream shape analysis scenarios. Conventional parameterization approaches
demand high-quality mesh triangulation and are restricted to certain simple
topologies unless additional surface cutting and decomposition are provided. In
practice, the optimal configurations (e.g., type of parameterization domains,
distribution of cutting seams, number of mapping charts) may vary drastically
with different surface structures and task characteristics, thus requiring more
flexible and controllable processing pipelines. To this end, this paper
introduces FlexPara, an unsupervised neural optimization framework to achieve
both global and multi-chart surface parameterizations by establishing
point-wise mappings between 3D surface points and adaptively-deformed 2D UV
coordinates. We ingeniously design and combine a series of
geometrically-interpretable sub-networks, with specific functionalities of
cutting, deforming, unwrapping, and wrapping, to construct a bi-directional
cycle mapping framework for global parameterization without the need for
manually specified cutting seams. Furthermore, we construct a multi-chart
parameterization framework with adaptively-learned chart assignment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the universality, superiority, and inspiring potential
of our neural surface parameterization paradigm. The code will be publicly
available at https://github.com/AidenZhao/FlexPara

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术的快速发展，尤其是基于指令的图像编辑，对数字图像的完整性构成威胁，现有防御系统难以检测。

Method: 提出CapsFake，通过整合视觉、文本和频域模态的低级胶囊，利用竞争路由机制动态聚合局部特征，精准识别篡改区域。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估，CapsFake检测准确率比现有方法高20%，抗干扰和对抗攻击能力分别达到94%和96%。

Conclusion: CapsFake为对抗复杂图像篡改提供了强大框架。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake technology, particularly in
instruction-guided image editing, threatens the integrity of digital images by
enabling subtle, context-aware manipulations. Generated conditionally from real
images and textual prompts, these edits are often imperceptible to both humans
and existing detection systems, revealing significant limitations in current
defenses. We propose a novel multimodal capsule network, CapsFake, designed to
detect such deepfake image edits by integrating low-level capsules from visual,
textual, and frequency-domain modalities. High-level capsules, predicted
through a competitive routing mechanism, dynamically aggregate local features
to identify manipulated regions with precision. Evaluated on diverse datasets,
including MagicBrush, Unsplash Edits, Open Images Edits, and Multi-turn Edits,
CapsFake outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 20% in detection
accuracy. Ablation studies validate its robustness, achieving detection rates
above 94% under natural perturbations and 96% against adversarial attacks, with
excellent generalization to unseen editing scenarios. This approach establishes
a powerful framework for countering sophisticated image manipulations.

Result: 在医学影像、自动驾驶和卫星影像等领域的实验中，CARL表现出对光谱异质性的鲁棒性，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: CARL的扩展性和通用性使其成为未来光谱基础模型的骨干。

Abstract: Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains,
including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as
a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel
dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the
development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with
limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address
this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{CARL}$, a model for
$\textbf{C}$amera-$\textbf{A}$gnostic $\textbf{R}$epresentation
$\textbf{L}$earning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging
modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel
dimensionality to a camera-agnostic embedding, we introduce wavelength
positional encoding and a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism to compress
spectral information into learned query representations. Spectral-spatial
pre-training is achieved with a novel spectral self-supervised JEPA-inspired
strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of
medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our
model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets
with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability
and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for
future spectral foundation models.

Motivation: 解决非刚性物体从2D关键点预测3D形状时的病态问题，如遮挡和视角与形状变化的解耦。现有方法依赖低秩约束，限制了重建质量。

Method: 采用高容量模型和无监督损失，结合局部低秩约束，避免全局对齐的依赖性。

Result: 在S-Up3D数据集上，重建误差降低了70%以上。

Conclusion: 高容量模型结合局部低秩约束显著提升了非刚性物体3D形状预测的准确性。

Abstract: For non-rigid objects, predicting the 3D shape from 2D keypoint observations
is ill-posed due to occlusions, and the need to disentangle changes in
viewpoint and changes in shape. This challenge has often been addressed by
embedding low-rank constraints into specialized models. These models can be
hard to train, as they depend on finding a canonical way of aligning
observations, before they can learn detailed geometry. These constraints have
limited the reconstruction quality. We show that generic, high capacity models,
trained with an unsupervised loss, allow for more accurate predicted shapes. In
particular, applying low-rank constraints to localized subsets of the full
shape allows the high capacity to be suitably constrained. We reduce the
state-of-the-art reconstruction error on the S-Up3D dataset by over 70%.

Result: 实验表明，SALCR在跨模态行人重识别任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SALCR通过细粒度语义对齐和协作优化，显著提升了跨模态行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) seeks to
match pedestrian images of the same individual across different modalities
without human annotations for model learning. Previous methods unify
pseudo-labels of cross-modality images through label association algorithms and
then design contrastive learning framework for global feature learning.
However, these methods overlook the cross-modality variations in feature
representation and pseudo-label distributions brought by fine-grained patterns.
This insight results in insufficient modality-shared learning when only global
features are optimized. To address this issue, we propose a Semantic-Aligned
Learning with Collaborative Refinement (SALCR) framework, which builds up
optimization objective for specific fine-grained patterns emphasized by each
modality, thereby achieving complementary alignment between the label
distributions of different modalities. Specifically, we first introduce a Dual
Association with Global Learning (DAGI) module to unify the pseudo-labels of
cross-modality instances in a bi-directional manner. Afterward, a Fine-Grained
Semantic-Aligned Learning (FGSAL) module is carried out to explore part-level
semantic-aligned patterns emphasized by each modality from cross-modality
instances. Optimization objective is then formulated based on the
semantic-aligned features and their corresponding label space. To alleviate the
side-effects arising from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose a Global-Part
Collaborative Refinement (GPCR) module to mine reliable positive sample sets
for the global and part features dynamically and optimize the inter-instance
relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method, which achieves superior performances to state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at

Motivation: 当前缺乏评估目标检测中XAI方法的标准，阻碍了方法比较和选择。

Method: 引入ODExAI框架，评估XAI方法在目标检测中的表现，使用YOLOX和Faster R-CNN模型及标准数据集。

Result: 区域方法（如D-CLOSE）定位准确（PG=88.49%）且忠实性高（OA=0.863），但计算开销大（71.42s）；CAM方法（如G-CAME）定位更优（PG=96.13%）且速度快（0.54s），但忠实性较低（OA=0.549）。

Conclusion: 不同XAI方法在性能上存在权衡，需根据任务需求选择。ODExAI框架为评估提供了标准化工具。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques for interpreting object
detection models remain in an early stage, with no established standards for
systematic evaluation. This absence of consensus hinders both the comparative
analysis of methods and the informed selection of suitable approaches. To
address this gap, we introduce the Object Detection Explainable AI Evaluation
(ODExAI), a comprehensive framework designed to assess XAI methods in object
detection based on three core dimensions: localization accuracy, faithfulness
to model behavior, and computational complexity. We benchmark a set of XAI
methods across two widely used object detectors (YOLOX and Faster R-CNN) and
standard datasets (MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC). Empirical results demonstrate that
region-based methods (e.g., D-CLOSE) achieve strong localization (PG = 88.49%)
and high model faithfulness (OA = 0.863), though with substantial computational
overhead (Time = 71.42s). On the other hand, CAM-based methods (e.g., G-CAME)
achieve superior localization (PG = 96.13%) and significantly lower runtime
(Time = 0.54s), but at the expense of reduced faithfulness (OA = 0.549). These
findings demonstrate critical trade-offs among existing XAI approaches and
reinforce the need for task-specific evaluation when deploying them in object
detection pipelines. Our implementation and evaluation benchmarks are publicly
available at: https://github.com/Analytics-Everywhere-Lab/odexai.

Abstract: In human-centered environments such as restaurants, homes, and warehouses,
robots often face challenges in accurately recognizing 3D objects. These
challenges stem from the complexity and variability of these environments,
including diverse object shapes. In this paper, we propose a novel Lightweight
Multi-modal Multi-view Convolutional-Vision Transformer network (LM-MCVT) to
enhance 3D object recognition in robotic applications. Our approach leverages
the Globally Entropy-based Embeddings Fusion (GEEF) method to integrate
multi-views efficiently. The LM-MCVT architecture incorporates pre- and
mid-level convolutional encoders and local and global transformers to enhance
feature extraction and recognition accuracy. We evaluate our method on the
synthetic ModelNet40 dataset and achieve a recognition accuracy of 95.6% using
a four-view setup, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. To further
validate its effectiveness, we conduct 5-fold cross-validation on the
real-world OmniObject3D dataset using the same configuration. Results
consistently show superior performance, demonstrating the method's robustness
in 3D object recognition across synthetic and real-world 3D data.

Abstract: LiDAR place recognition is a critical capability for autonomous navigation
and cross-modal localization in large-scale outdoor environments. Existing
approaches predominantly depend on pre-built 3D dense maps or aerial imagery,
which impose significant storage overhead and lack real-time adaptability. In
this paper, we propose OPAL, a novel network for LiDAR place recognition that
leverages OpenStreetMap as a lightweight and up-to-date prior. Our key
innovation lies in bridging the domain disparity between sparse LiDAR scans and
structured OSM data through two carefully designed components: a cross-modal
visibility mask that identifies maximal observable regions from both modalities
to guide feature learning, and an adaptive radial fusion module that
dynamically consolidates multiscale radial features into discriminative global
descriptors. Extensive experiments on the augmented KITTI and KITTI-360
datasets demonstrate OPAL's superiority, achieving 15.98% higher recall at @1m
threshold for top-1 retrieved matches while operating at 12x faster inference
speeds compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Code and datasets are publicly

Conclusion: RF-GS方法有效解决了场景视图合成中的渲染质量问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Scene view synthesis, which generates novel views from limited perspectives,
is increasingly vital for applications like virtual reality, augmented reality,
and robotics. Unlike object-based tasks, such as generating 360{\deg} views of
a car, scene view synthesis handles entire environments where non-uniform
observations pose unique challenges for stable rendering quality. To address
this issue, we propose a novel approach: renderability field-guided gaussian
splatting (RF-GS). This method quantifies input inhomogeneity through a
renderability field, guiding pseudo-view sampling to enhanced visual
consistency. To ensure the quality of wide-baseline pseudo-views, we train an
image restoration model to map point projections to visible-light styles.
Additionally, our validated hybrid data optimization strategy effectively fuses
information of pseudo-view angles and source view textures. Comparative
experiments on simulated and real-world data show that our method outperforms
existing approaches in rendering stability.

Conclusion: 本文提出的初始化方法具有普适性和稳定性，显著提升了INR的性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are a versatile and powerful tool for
encoding various forms of data, including images, videos, sound, and 3D shapes.
A critical factor in the success of INRs is the initialization of the network,
which can significantly impact the convergence and accuracy of the learned
model. Unfortunately, commonly used neural network initializations are not
widely applicable for many activation functions, especially those used by INRs.
In this paper, we improve upon previous initialization methods by deriving an
initialization that has stable variance across layers, and applies to any
activation function. We show that this generalizes many previous initialization
methods, and has even better stability for well studied activations. We also
show that our initialization leads to improved results with INR activation
functions in multiple signal modalities. Our approach is particularly effective
for Gaussian INRs, where we demonstrate that the theory of our initialization
matches with task performance in multiple experiments, allowing us to achieve
improvements in image, audio, and 3D surface reconstruction.

Abstract: Gaze target detection (GTD) is the task of predicting where a person in an
image is looking. This is a challenging task, as it requires the ability to
understand the relationship between the person's head, body, and eyes, as well
as the surrounding environment. In this paper, we propose a novel method for
GTD that fuses multiple pieces of information extracted from an image. First,
we project the 2D image into a 3D representation using monocular depth
estimation. We then extract a depth-infused saliency module map, which
highlights the most salient (\textit{attention-grabbing}) regions in image for
the subject in consideration. We also extract face and depth modalities from
the image, and finally fuse all the extracted modalities to identify the gaze
target. We quantitatively evaluated our method, including the ablation analysis
on three publicly available datasets, namely VideoAttentionTarget, GazeFollow
and GOO-Real, and showed that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
This suggests that our method is a promising new approach for GTD.

Result: 在Houston 2013和Indian Pines数据集上，IWGS的分类精度高达97.8%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IWGS是一种高效且适用于资源受限环境的波段选择方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification presents significant challenges due
to the high dimensionality, spectral redundancy, and limited labeled data
typically available in real-world applications. To address these issues and
optimize classification performance, we propose a novel band selection strategy
known as Iterative Wavelet-based Gradient Sampling (IWGS). This method
incrementally selects the most informative spectral bands by analyzing
gradients within the wavelet-transformed domain, enabling efficient and
targeted dimensionality reduction. Unlike traditional selection methods, IWGS
leverages the multi-resolution properties of wavelets to better capture subtle
spectral variations relevant for classification. The iterative nature of the
approach ensures that redundant or noisy bands are systematically excluded
while maximizing the retention of discriminative features. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on two widely-used benchmark HSI datasets: Houston
2013 and Indian Pines. Results demonstrate that IWGS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art band selection and classification techniques in terms of both
accuracy and computational efficiency. These improvements make our method
especially suitable for deployment in edge devices or other
resource-constrained environments, where memory and processing power are
limited. In particular, IWGS achieved an overall accuracy up to 97.8% on Indian
Pines for selected classes, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability

Motivation: 水下视频因光线吸收、散射和噪声（如海洋雪花）导致质量下降，现有方法因缺乏配对训练数据而效果不佳。

Method: 提出一种新方法，从原始水下视频生成配对数据集（含雪花和无雪花图像），用于监督训练视频增强模型。

Result: 生成的配对数据集有效支持了水下图像恢复任务，尤其在缺乏真实数据的情况下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架为水下视频增强提供了一种可行解决方案，尤其在数据稀缺场景下具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Underwater videos often suffer from degraded quality due to light absorption,
scattering, and various noise sources. Among these, marine snow, which is
suspended organic particles appearing as bright spots or noise, significantly
impacts machine vision tasks, particularly those involving feature matching.
Existing methods for removing marine snow are ineffective due to the lack of
paired training data. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel
enhancement framework that introduces a new approach for generating paired
datasets from raw underwater videos. The resulting dataset consists of paired
images of generated snowy and snow, free underwater videos, enabling supervised
training for video enhancement. We describe the dataset creation process,
highlight its key characteristics, and demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing underwater image restoration in the absence of ground truth.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法的融合策略存在参数爆炸、优化不稳定和特征对齐等问题，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出FusionNet，一种基于Hilbert空间理论的多模型线性并行融合框架，有效捕捉全局和局部特征。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上显著优于现有方法，CVPR2025 NTIRE挑战赛中排名第一。

Conclusion: FusionNet通过线性融合策略解决了现有问题，实现了鲁棒的低光图像增强。

Abstract: The advent of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has driven remarkable progress in
low-light image enhancement (LLIE), with diverse architectures (e.g., CNNs and
Transformers) and color spaces (e.g., sRGB, HSV, HVI) yielding impressive
results. Recent efforts have sought to leverage the complementary strengths of
these paradigms, offering promising solutions to enhance performance across
varying degradation scenarios. However, existing fusion strategies are hindered
by challenges such as parameter explosion, optimization instability, and
feature misalignment, limiting further improvements. To overcome these issues,
we introduce FusionNet, a novel multi-model linear fusion framework that
operates in parallel to effectively capture global and local features across
diverse color spaces. By incorporating a linear fusion strategy underpinned by
Hilbert space theoretical guarantees, FusionNet mitigates network collapse and
reduces excessive training costs. Our method achieved 1st place in the CVPR2025
NTIRE Low Light Enhancement Challenge. Extensive experiments conducted on
synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both
quantitative and qualitative results, delivering robust enhancement under
diverse low-light conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病（CAD）是全球主要死因之一，现有方法在低对比度、形态变异和小血管分割方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用心肌区域引导模块、残差特征提取编码模块和多尺度特征融合模块，结合蒙特卡洛dropout量化预测不确定性。

Conclusion: MGFA-Net为CAD提供了自动化且临床可解释的评估，结合深度学习和解剖学先验知识，推动精准医学发展。

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
requiring accurate segmentation and stenosis detection using Coronary Computed
Tomography angiography (CCTA). Existing methods struggle with challenges such
as low contrast, morphological variability and small vessel segmentation. To
address these limitations, we propose the Myocardial Region-guided Feature
Aggregation Net, a novel U-shaped dual-encoder architecture that integrates
anatomical prior knowledge to enhance robustness in coronary artery
segmentation. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) a
Myocardial Region-guided Module that directs attention to coronary regions via
myocardial contour expansion and multi-scale feature fusion, (2) a Residual
Feature Extraction Encoding Module that combines parallel spatial channel
attention with residual blocks to enhance local-global feature discrimination,
and (3) a Multi-scale Feature Fusion Module for adaptive aggregation of
hierarchical vascular features. Additionally, Monte Carlo dropout f quantifies
prediction uncertainty, supporting clinical interpretability. For stenosis
detection, a morphology-based centerline extraction algorithm separates the
vascular tree into anatomical branches, enabling cross-sectional area
quantification and stenosis grading. The superiority of MGFA-Net was
demonstrated by achieving an Dice score of 85.04%, an accuracy of 84.24%, an
HD95 of 6.1294 mm, and an improvement of 5.46% in true positive rate for
stenosis detection compared to3D U-Net. The integrated segmentation-to-stenosis
pipeline provides automated, clinically interpretable CAD assessment, bridging
deep learning with anatomical prior knowledge for precision medicine. Our code

Motivation: 随着Transformer模型规模和参数数量的增加，性能提升逐渐减弱，而训练成本却显著增加。多模态学习中的推理成本尤其关键，因此需要更高效的微调和推理方法。

Method: 受预训练模型深层隐式对齐特性的启发，作者提出了一种简单的改进方法，用于现有的多模态框架。

Result: 该方法在保持或提升基线性能的同时，显著减少了训练和推理的计算成本。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为多模态学习提供了高效解决方案，还为将预训练模型组合为更大系统提供了启示。

Abstract: The hyperscaling of data and parameter count in Transformer-based models is
yielding diminishing performance improvement, especially when weighed against
training costs. Such plateauing indicates the importance of methods for more
efficient finetuning and inference, while retaining similar performance. This
is especially relevant for multimodal learning paradigms, where inference costs
of processing multimodal tokens can determine the model's practical viability.
At the same time, research on representations and mechanistic interpretability
has improved our understanding of the inner workings of Transformer-based
models; one such line of work reveals an implicit alignment in the deeper
layers of pretrained models, across modalities. Taking inspiration from this,
we motivate and propose a simple modification to existing multimodal frameworks
that rely on aligning pretrained models. We demonstrate that our approach
maintains and, in some cases, even improves performance of baseline methods
while achieving significant gains in both training and inference-time compute.
Our work also has implications for combining pretrained models into larger
systems efficiently.

Result: 结果表明该方法能有效量化行清洁器性能，提升播种效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为行清洁器选择和精准农业播种效率提供了改进潜力。

Abstract: Effective seed sowing in precision agriculture is hindered by challenges such
as residue accumulation, low soil temperatures, and hair pinning (crop residue
pushed in the trench by furrow opener), which obstruct optimal trench
formation. Row cleaners are employed to mitigate these issues, but there is a
lack of quantitative methods to assess trench cleanliness. In this study, a
novel computer vision-based method was developed to evaluate row cleaner
performance. Multiple air seeders were equipped with a video acquisition system
to capture trench conditions after row cleaner operation, enabling an effective
comparison of the performance of each row cleaner. The captured data were used
to develop a segmentation model that analyzed key elements such as soil, straw,
and machinery. Using the results from the segmentation model, an objective
method was developed to quantify row cleaner performance. The results
demonstrated the potential of this method to improve row cleaner selection and
enhance seeding efficiency in precision agriculture.

Motivation: 肺癌早期检测对患者预后至关重要，但现有XAI系统在数据有限时难以提供清晰解释。

Method: MERA结合自监督学习和Vision Transformer进行无监督特征提取，利用半监督主动学习在潜在空间中进行分层预测。

Result: 在LIDC数据集上，MERA仅需1%标注样本即达到或超越全标注方法的诊断准确性，并提供多层次解释。

Conclusion: MERA设计增强了AI诊断的可信度和透明度，降低了医疗领域部署AI的门槛。

Abstract: Lung cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, emphasises
the importance of early detection for better patient outcomes. Pulmonary
nodules, often early indicators of lung cancer, necessitate accurate, timely
diagnosis. Despite Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) advances, many
existing systems struggle providing clear, comprehensive explanations,
especially with limited labelled data. This study introduces MERA, a Multimodal
and Multiscale self-Explanatory model designed for lung nodule diagnosis with
considerably Reduced Annotation requirements. MERA integrates unsupervised and
weakly supervised learning strategies (self-supervised learning techniques and
Vision Transformer architecture for unsupervised feature extraction) and a
hierarchical prediction mechanism leveraging sparse annotations via
semi-supervised active learning in the learned latent space. MERA explains its
decisions on multiple levels: model-level global explanations via semantic
latent space clustering, instance-level case-based explanations showing similar
instances, local visual explanations via attention maps, and concept
explanations using critical nodule attributes. Evaluations on the public LIDC
dataset show MERA's superior diagnostic accuracy and self-explainability. With
only 1% annotated samples, MERA achieves diagnostic accuracy comparable to or
exceeding state-of-the-art methods requiring full annotation. The model's
inherent design delivers comprehensive, robust, multilevel explanations aligned
closely with clinical practice, enhancing trustworthiness and transparency.
Demonstrated viability of unsupervised and weakly supervised learning lowers
the barrier to deploying diagnostic AI in broader medical domains. Our complete

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了公平性，同时保持了全局准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为设计公平的人脸识别系统提供了一种有效且计算高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The urging societal demand for fair AI systems has put pressure on the
research community to develop predictive models that are not only globally
accurate but also meet new fairness criteria, reflecting the lack of disparate
mistreatment with respect to sensitive attributes ($\textit{e.g.}$ gender,
ethnicity, age). In particular, the variability of the errors made by certain
Facial Recognition (FR) systems across specific segments of the population
compromises the deployment of the latter, and was judged unacceptable by
regulatory authorities. Designing fair FR systems is a very challenging
problem, mainly due to the complex and functional nature of the performance
measure used in this domain ($\textit{i.e.}$ ROC curves) and because of the
huge heterogeneity of the face image datasets usually available for training.
In this paper, we propose a novel post-processing approach to improve the
fairness of pre-trained FR models by optimizing a regression loss which acts on
centroid-based scores. Beyond the computational advantages of the method, we
present numerical experiments providing strong empirical evidence of the gain
in fairness and of the ability to preserve global accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在多视角同步相机依赖和姿态参数精确估计上的限制，提出更实用的单目或多目视图渲染方案。

Method: 通过粗粒度T姿态表示结合细粒度像素对齐特征，利用前馈模型快速推断，填补缺失信息。

Result: 在单视图输入下与现有技术竞争，多视图输入下视觉质量显著提升，对噪声参数更鲁棒。

Conclusion: HumMorph在自由视角人体渲染中表现出色，尤其在实用场景下优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce HumMorph, a novel generalized approach to free-viewpoint
rendering of dynamic human bodies with explicit pose control. HumMorph renders
a human actor in any specified pose given a few observed views (starting from
just one) in arbitrary poses. Our method enables fast inference as it relies
only on feed-forward passes through the model. We first construct a coarse
representation of the actor in the canonical T-pose, which combines visual
features from individual partial observations and fills missing information
using learned prior knowledge. The coarse representation is complemented by
fine-grained pixel-aligned features extracted directly from the observed views,
which provide high-resolution appearance information. We show that HumMorph is
competitive with the state-of-the-art when only a single input view is
available, however, we achieve results with significantly better visual quality
given just 2 monocular observations. Moreover, previous generalized methods
assume access to accurate body shape and pose parameters obtained using
synchronized multi-camera setups. In contrast, we consider a more practical
scenario where these body parameters are noisily estimated directly from the
observed views. Our experimental results demonstrate that our architecture is
more robust to errors in the noisy parameters and clearly outperforms the state
of the art in this setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态匹配方法在复杂手术场景（如视角变化、器械遮挡和组织变形）中表现不佳，需要一种动态、实时的导航系统。

Method: 系统将Atkinson-Shiffrin记忆模型的三级架构（感觉记忆、工作记忆和长期记忆）融入动态视频序列跟踪，无需额外硬件即可实时运行。

Result: 系统在标准设备上实现25.3 FPS和39.5 ms延迟，跟踪误差较静态系统降低45%（长序列）至19%（短序列）。

Conclusion: 该系统克服了静态方法的局限性，为提升手术精度提供了新技术支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic arthroscopic navigation system based on
multi-level memory architecture for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
reconstruction surgery. The system extends our previously proposed markerless
navigation method from static image matching to dynamic video sequence
tracking. By integrating the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model's three-level
architecture (sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memory), our system
maintains continuous tracking of the femoral condyle throughout the surgical
procedure, providing stable navigation support even in complex situations
involving viewpoint changes, instrument occlusion, and tissue deformation.
Unlike existing methods, our system operates in real-time on standard
arthroscopic equipment without requiring additional tracking hardware,
achieving 25.3 FPS with a latency of only 39.5 ms, representing a 3.5-fold
improvement over our previous static system. For extended sequences (1000
frames), the dynamic system maintained an error of 5.3 plus-minus 1.5 pixels,
compared to the static system's 12.6 plus-minus 3.7 pixels - an improvement of
approximately 45 percent. For medium-length sequences (500 frames) and short
sequences (100 frames), the system achieved approximately 35 percent and 19
percent accuracy improvements, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate
the system overcomes limitations of traditional static matching methods,
providing new technical support for improving surgical precision in ACL
reconstruction.

Abstract: While the availability of open 3D medical shape datasets is increasing,
offering substantial benefits to the research community, we have found that
many of these datasets are, unfortunately, disorganized and contain artifacts.
These issues limit the development and training of robust models, particularly
for accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. In this paper, we examine the current
state of available 3D liver shape datasets and propose a solution using
diffusion models combined with implicit neural representations (INRs) to
augment and expand existing datasets. Our approach utilizes the generative
capabilities of diffusion models to create realistic, diverse 3D liver shapes,
capturing a wide range of anatomical variations and addressing the problem of
data scarcity. Experimental results indicate that our method enhances dataset
diversity, providing a scalable solution to improve the accuracy and
reliability of 3D liver reconstruction and generation in medical applications.
Finally, we suggest that diffusion models can also be applied to other
downstream tasks in 3D medical imaging.

Motivation: ViT的多头部注意力机制缺乏可解释性，现有方法未能有效区分不同头部的重要性。

Method: 提出GMAR方法，通过梯度评分量化每个注意力头的重要性，并归一化生成加权注意力分数。

Result: 实验表明GMAR优于传统注意力展开方法，提升了ViT的可解释性。

Conclusion: GMAR为ViT模型提供了一种增强可解释性的实用框架。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) has made significant advancements in computer
vision, utilizing self-attention mechanisms to achieve state-of-the-art
performance across various tasks, including image classification, object
detection, and segmentation. Its architectural flexibility and capabilities
have made it a preferred choice among researchers and practitioners. However,
the intricate multi-head attention mechanism of ViT presents significant
challenges to interpretability, as the underlying prediction process remains
opaque. A critical limitation arises from an observation commonly noted in
transformer architectures: "Not all attention heads are equally meaningful."
Overlooking the relative importance of specific heads highlights the
limitations of existing interpretability methods. To address these challenges,
we introduce Gradient-Driven Multi-Head Attention Rollout (GMAR), a novel
method that quantifies the importance of each attention head using
gradient-based scores. These scores are normalized to derive a weighted
aggregate attention score, effectively capturing the relative contributions of
individual heads. GMAR clarifies the role of each head in the prediction
process, enabling more precise interpretability at the head level. Experimental
results demonstrate that GMAR consistently outperforms traditional attention
rollout techniques. This work provides a practical contribution to
transformer-based architectures, establishing a robust framework for enhancing
the interpretability of Vision Transformer models.

Motivation: 原始方法在处理事件数据时计算复杂度高，难以实现实时处理。本文旨在通过优化算法降低计算成本，实现实时性能。

Method: 将事件坐标视为整数，将表示步骤重新定义为池化操作，替代原始方法中的邻接矩阵乘法，从而降低计算复杂度。

Result: 优化后的方法在RTX 3070上每秒处理400万次正常流，在RTX A5000上每秒处理600万次，仅占用1GB CUDA内存。

Conclusion: 通过池化操作优化算法，显著降低了计算成本，实现了实时正常流预测，并开源了CUDA实现和Python接口。

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time, asynchronous, event-based normal flow
estimator. It follows the same algorithm as Learning Normal Flow Directly From
Event Neighborhoods, but with a more optimized implementation. The original
method treats event slices as 3D point clouds, encodes each event's local
geometry into a fixed-length vector, and uses a multi-layer perceptron to
predict normal flow. It constructs representations by multiplying an adjacency
matrix with a feature matrix, resulting in quadratic time complexity with
respect to the number of events. In contrast, we leverage the fact that event
coordinates are integers and reformulate the representation step as a pooling
operation. This achieves the same effect as the adjacency matrix but with much
lower computational cost. As a result, our method supports real-time normal
flow prediction on event cameras. Our estimator uses 1 GB of CUDA memory and
runs at 4 million normal flows per second on an RTX 3070, or 6 million per
second on an RTX A5000. We release the CUDA implementation along with a Python
interface at https://github.com/dhyuan99/VecKM_flow_cpp.

Motivation: 卫星图像和地图的双向翻译在规划和灾害响应中有重要应用，但缺乏像素级对齐和高层次抽象能力是主要挑战。

Method: EarthMapper采用地理坐标嵌入和多尺度特征对齐（GJSA），结合语义注入（SI）和关键点自适应引导（KPAG）机制。

Result: 在CNSatMap和纽约数据集上，EarthMapper在视觉真实性、语义一致性和结构保真度上优于现有方法，且支持零样本任务。

Conclusion: EarthMapper通过创新框架解决了双向翻译的复杂性问题，展现了多功能性和高性能。

Abstract: Satellite imagery and maps, as two fundamental data modalities in remote
sensing, offer direct observations of the Earth's surface and
human-interpretable geographic abstractions, respectively. The task of
bidirectional translation between satellite images and maps (BSMT) holds
significant potential for applications in urban planning and disaster response.
However, this task presents two major challenges: first, the absence of precise
pixel-wise alignment between the two modalities substantially complicates the
translation process; second, it requires achieving both high-level abstraction
of geographic features and high-quality visual synthesis, which further
elevates the technical complexity. To address these limitations, we introduce
EarthMapper, a novel autoregressive framework for controllable bidirectional
satellite-map translation. EarthMapper employs geographic coordinate embeddings
to anchor generation, ensuring region-specific adaptability, and leverages
multi-scale feature alignment within a geo-conditioned joint scale
autoregression (GJSA) process to unify bidirectional translation in a single
training cycle. A semantic infusion (SI) mechanism is introduced to enhance
feature-level consistency, while a key point adaptive guidance (KPAG) mechanism
is proposed to dynamically balance diversity and precision during inference. We
further contribute CNSatMap, a large-scale dataset comprising 302,132 precisely
aligned satellite-map pairs across 38 Chinese cities, enabling robust
benchmarking. Extensive experiments on CNSatMap and the New York dataset
demonstrate EarthMapper's superior performance, achieving significant
improvements in visual realism, semantic consistency, and structural fidelity
over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, EarthMapper excels in zero-shot
tasks like in-painting, out-painting and coordinate-conditional generation,
underscoring its versatility.

Conclusion: 本研究为数据驱动的医学预测提供了新方向，不仅提高了细粒度诊断的可靠性，还探索了多模态方法在医学图像分析中的应用。

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a universal chronic musculoskeletal disorders
worldwide, making early diagnosis crucial. Currently, the Kellgren and Lawrence
(KL) grading system is widely used to assess KOA severity. However, its high
inter-observer variability and subjectivity hinder diagnostic consistency. To
address these limitations, automated diagnostic techniques using deep learning
have been actively explored in recent years. In this study, we propose a
CLIP-based framework (CLIP-KOA) to enhance the consistency and reliability of
KOA grade prediction. To achieve this, we introduce a learning approach that
integrates image and text information and incorporate Symmetry Loss and
Consistency Loss to ensure prediction consistency between the original and
flipped images. CLIP-KOA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 71.86\% on KOA
severity prediction task, and ablation studies show that CLIP-KOA has 2.36\%
improvement in accuracy over the standard CLIP model due to our contribution.
This study shows a novel direction for data-driven medical prediction not only
to improve reliability of fine-grained diagnosis and but also to explore

### [135] [Masked Language Prompting for Generative Data Augmentation in Few-shot Fashion Style Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19455)
*Yuki Hirakawa,Ryotaro Shimizu*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种名为Masked Language Prompting (MLP)的新提示策略，通过掩码和语言模型生成多样且语义一致的图像描述，用于时尚风格识别的数据增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚风格识别数据集构建因风格概念的主观性和模糊性而具有挑战性，现有方法难以平衡视觉多样性和风格一致性。

Method: MLP策略掩码参考描述中的部分词汇，利用大语言模型生成多样且语义连贯的补全，保持原始描述结构的同时引入属性级变化。

Result: 在FashionStyle14数据集上，MLP增强方法优于基于类名和描述的基线方法。

Conclusion: MLP方法在有限监督下有效提升了时尚风格识别的性能。

Abstract: Constructing dataset for fashion style recognition is challenging due to the
inherent subjectivity and ambiguity of style concepts. Recent advances in
text-to-image models have facilitated generative data augmentation by
synthesizing images from labeled data, yet existing methods based solely on
class names or reference captions often fail to balance visual diversity and
style consistency. In this work, we propose \textbf{Masked Language Prompting
(MLP)}, a novel prompting strategy that masks selected words in a reference
caption and leverages large language models to generate diverse yet
semantically coherent completions. This approach preserves the structural
semantics of the original caption while introducing attribute-level variations
aligned with the intended style, enabling style-consistent and diverse image
generation without fine-tuning. Experimental results on the FashionStyle14
dataset demonstrate that our MLP-based augmentation consistently outperforms
class-name and caption-based baselines, validating its effectiveness for
fashion style recognition under limited supervision.

Abstract: Robust tooling and publicly available pre-trained models have helped drive
recent advances in mechanistic interpretability for language models. However,
similar progress in vision mechanistic interpretability has been hindered by
the lack of accessible frameworks and pre-trained weights. We present Prisma
(Access the codebase here: https://github.com/Prisma-Multimodal/ViT-Prisma), an
open-source framework designed to accelerate vision mechanistic
interpretability research, providing a unified toolkit for accessing 75+ vision
and video transformers; support for sparse autoencoder (SAE), transcoder, and
crosscoder training; a suite of 80+ pre-trained SAE weights; activation
caching, circuit analysis tools, and visualization tools; and educational
resources. Our analysis reveals surprising findings, including that effective
vision SAEs can exhibit substantially lower sparsity patterns than language
SAEs, and that in some instances, SAE reconstructions can decrease model loss.
Prisma enables new research directions for understanding vision model internals
while lowering barriers to entry in this emerging field.

Motivation: 传统方法使用边界框定位3D物体，但效果有限。本文提出用立方体作为更高效的替代方案，以紧凑生成场景并减少物体交叉。

Method: 使用自回归模型CasaGPT逐步排列立方体，通过拒绝采样过滤碰撞场景，并引入去噪数据集3DFRONT-NC。

Result: 在3D-FRONT和3DFRONT-NC数据集上实验，CasaGPT显著减少物体交叉，提升场景真实感，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CasaGPT为3D场景合成提供了高效且物理合理的解决方案，未来可进一步优化场景生成质量。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for indoor scene synthesis, which learns to
arrange decomposed cuboid primitives to represent 3D objects within a scene.
Unlike conventional methods that use bounding boxes to determine the placement
and scale of 3D objects, our approach leverages cuboids as a straightforward
yet highly effective alternative for modeling objects. This allows for compact
scene generation while minimizing object intersections. Our approach, coined
CasaGPT for Cuboid Arrangement and Scene Assembly, employs an autoregressive
model to sequentially arrange cuboids, producing physically plausible scenes.
By applying rejection sampling during the fine-tuning stage to filter out
scenes with object collisions, our model further reduces intersections and
enhances scene quality. Additionally, we introduce a refined dataset,
3DFRONT-NC, which eliminates significant noise presented in the original
dataset, 3D-FRONT. Extensive experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset as well as our
dataset demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, enhancing the realism of generated scenes, and
providing a promising direction for 3D scene synthesis.

Conclusion: SynergyAmodal框架成功解决了数据稀缺问题，并通过三方协作实现了高质量去遮挡数据集的合成和模型训练。

Abstract: Image deocclusion (or amodal completion) aims to recover the invisible
regions (\ie, shape and appearance) of occluded instances in images. Despite
recent advances, the scarcity of high-quality data that balances diversity,
plausibility, and fidelity remains a major obstacle. To address this challenge,
we identify three critical elements: leveraging in-the-wild image data for
diversity, incorporating human expertise for plausibility, and utilizing
generative priors for fidelity. We propose SynergyAmodal, a novel framework for
co-synthesizing in-the-wild amodal datasets with comprehensive shape and
appearance annotations, which integrates these elements through a tripartite
data-human-model collaboration. First, we design an occlusion-grounded
self-supervised learning algorithm to harness the diversity of in-the-wild
image data, fine-tuning an inpainting diffusion model into a partial completion
diffusion model. Second, we establish a co-synthesis pipeline to iteratively
filter, refine, select, and annotate the initial deocclusion results of the
partial completion diffusion model, ensuring plausibility and fidelity through
human expert guidance and prior model constraints. This pipeline generates a
high-quality paired amodal dataset with extensive category and scale diversity,
comprising approximately 16K pairs. Finally, we train a full completion
diffusion model on the synthesized dataset, incorporating text prompts as
conditioning signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework in achieving zero-shot generalization and textual
controllability. Our code, dataset, and models will be made publicly available
at https://github.com/imlixinyang/SynergyAmodal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有花样滑冰数据集仅关注单一任务（如动作识别或评分），缺乏对技术和艺术表现的全面标注，且体育研究多集中于球类运动，对艺术体育的研究有限。

Method: 提出FSAnno数据集，包含开放训练和测试数据，以及FSBench基准测试（分为FSBench-Text和FSBench-Motion），支持从技术分析到表演评论的多任务。

Result: FSBench的初步测试显示，现有模型对艺术体育的理解存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: FSBench有望成为评估和提升模型对花样滑冰理解的关键工具。

Abstract: Figure skating, known as the "Art on Ice," is among the most artistic sports,
challenging to understand due to its blend of technical elements (like jumps
and spins) and overall artistic expression. Existing figure skating datasets
mainly focus on single tasks, such as action recognition or scoring, lacking
comprehensive annotations for both technical and artistic evaluation. Current
sports research is largely centered on ball games, with limited relevance to
artistic sports like figure skating. To address this, we introduce FSAnno, a
large-scale dataset advancing artistic sports understanding through figure
skating. FSAnno includes an open-access training and test dataset, alongside a
benchmark dataset, FSBench, for fair model evaluation. FSBench consists of
FSBench-Text, with multiple-choice questions and explanations, and
FSBench-Motion, containing multimodal data and Question and Answer (QA) pairs,
supporting tasks from technical analysis to performance commentary. Initial
tests on FSBench reveal significant limitations in existing models'
understanding of artistic sports. We hope FSBench will become a key tool for
evaluating and enhancing model comprehension of figure skating.

TLDR: 提出了一种无需掩码标注的工业异常检测方法，通过动态奖励函数和推理框架解决类别不平衡问题，性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖大数据集和掩码标注，成本高且易误报；现有视觉语言模型也存在类似问题。工业数据集类别不平衡严重，需新方法解决。

Method: 引入动态奖励函数处理类别不平衡；采用Chain of Thought和GRPO机制构建无需掩码的推理框架，直接从图像检测异常。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上分别提升36%和16%的准确率，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该方法无需掩码标注，降低成本并提供可解释输出，推动了工业异常检测的发展。

Abstract: Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is critical for ensuring product quality
by identifying defects. Traditional methods such as feature embedding and
reconstruction-based approaches require large datasets and struggle with
scalability. Existing vision-language models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) address some limitations but rely on mask annotations,
leading to high implementation costs and false positives. Additionally,
industrial datasets like MVTec-AD and VisA suffer from severe class imbalance,
with defect samples constituting only 23.8% and 11.1% of total data
respectively. To address these challenges, we propose a reward function that
dynamically prioritizes rare defect patterns during training to handle class
imbalance. We also introduce a mask-free reasoning framework using Chain of
Thought (CoT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) mechanisms,
enabling anomaly detection directly from raw images without annotated masks.
This approach generates interpretable step-by-step explanations for defect
localization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
prior approaches by 36% in accuracy on MVTec-AD and 16% on VisA. By eliminating
mask dependency and reducing costs while providing explainable outputs, this
work advances industrial anomaly detection and supports scalable quality
control in manufacturing. Code to reproduce the experiment is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Adversarial Shallow Watermarking (ASW)的新型水印框架，通过浅层解码器抵抗未知失真，无需训练、编码器或噪声层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度神经网络的水印方法对未知失真鲁棒性不足，ASW旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ASW使用随机参数化的浅层解码器，通过对抗优化生成水印图像，利用解码器对失真的不敏感性提取水印。

Result: 实验表明，ASW对未知失真具有强鲁棒性，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ASW是一种高效、鲁棒的水印框架，适用于未知失真场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in digital watermarking make use of deep neural networks for
message embedding and extraction. They typically follow the ``encoder-noise
layer-decoder''-based architecture. By deliberately establishing a
differentiable noise layer to simulate the distortion of the watermarked
signal, they jointly train the deep encoder and decoder to fit the noise layer
to guarantee robustness. As a result, they are usually weak against unknown
distortions that are not used in their training pipeline. In this paper, we
propose a novel watermarking framework to resist unknown distortions, namely
Adversarial Shallow Watermarking (ASW). ASW utilizes only a shallow decoder
that is randomly parameterized and designed to be insensitive to distortions
for watermarking extraction. During the watermark embedding, ASW freezes the
shallow decoder and adversarially optimizes a host image until its updated
version (i.e., the watermarked image) stably triggers the shallow decoder to
output the watermark message. During the watermark extraction, it accurately
recovers the message from the watermarked image by leveraging the insensitive
nature of the shallow decoder against arbitrary distortions. Our ASW is
training-free, encoder-free, and noise layer-free. Experiments indicate that
the watermarked images created by ASW have strong robustness against various
unknown distortions. Compared to the existing ``encoder-noise layer-decoder''
approaches, ASW achieves comparable results on known distortions and better
robustness on unknown distortions.

Motivation: 四边形网格在几何建模和计算力学中至关重要，但现有基于学习的方法主要针对三角形网格，四边形网格生成因需满足共面性、凸性和纯四边形等条件而较少被探索。

Result: 在清晰和噪声数据上的广泛实验表明，Point2Quad在综合指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Point2Quad有效解决了纯四边形网格生成的挑战，展示了其在几何建模中的潜力。

Abstract: Quad meshes are essential in geometric modeling and computational mechanics.
Although learning-based methods for triangle mesh demonstrate considerable
advancements, quad mesh generation remains less explored due to the challenge
of ensuring coplanarity, convexity, and quad-only meshes. In this paper, we
present Point2Quad, the first learning-based method for quad-only mesh
generation from point clouds. The key idea is learning to identify quad mesh
with fused pointwise and facewise features. Specifically, Point2Quad begins
with a k-NN-based candidate generation considering the coplanarity and
squareness. Then, two encoders are followed to extract geometric and
topological features that address the challenge of quad-related constraints,
especially by combining in-depth quadrilaterals-specific characteristics.
Subsequently, the extracted features are fused to train the classifier with a
designed compound loss. The final results are derived after the refinement by a
quad-specific post-processing. Extensive experiments on both clear and noise
data demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of Point2Quad, compared to
baseline methods under comprehensive metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有群体检测方法依赖地面和航空图像，时空覆盖有限，而高分辨率卫星图像为此提供了新机会。

Method: 提出CrowdSat-Net，包含DCPAN（双上下文渐进注意力网络）和HFGDU（高频引导可变形上采样器）模块。

Result: 在CrowdSat数据集上，CrowdSat-Net的F1-score为66.12%，精度为73.23%，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 研究通过新网络架构和数据集推动了群体检测技术的发展。

Abstract: Accurate crowd detection (CD) is critical for public safety and historical
pattern analysis, yet existing methods relying on ground and aerial imagery
suffer from limited spatio-temporal coverage. The development of
very-fine-resolution (VFR) satellite sensor imagery (e.g., ~0.3 m spatial
resolution) provides unprecedented opportunities for large-scale crowd activity
analysis, but it has never been considered for this task. To address this gap,
we proposed CrowdSat-Net, a novel point-based convolutional neural network,
which features two innovative components: Dual-Context Progressive Attention
Network (DCPAN) to improve feature representation of individuals by aggregating
scene context and local individual characteristics, and High-Frequency Guided
Deformable Upsampler (HFGDU) that recovers high-frequency information during
upsampling through frequency-domain guided deformable convolutions. To validate
the effectiveness of CrowdSat-Net, we developed CrowdSat, the first VFR
satellite imagery dataset designed specifically for CD tasks, comprising over
120k manually labeled individuals from multi-source satellite platforms
(Beijing-3N, Jilin-1 Gaofen-04A and Google Earth) across China. In the
experiments, CrowdSat-Net was compared with five state-of-the-art point-based
CD methods (originally designed for ground or aerial imagery) using CrowdSat
and achieved the largest F1-score of 66.12% and Precision of 73.23%, surpassing
the second-best method by 1.71% and 2.42%, respectively. Moreover, extensive
ablation experiments validated the importance of the DCPAN and HFGDU modules.
Furthermore, cross-regional evaluation further demonstrated the spatial
generalizability of CrowdSat-Net. This research advances CD capability by
providing both a newly developed network architecture for CD and a pioneering
benchmark dataset to facilitate future CD development.

Abstract: Emotion understanding is a critical yet challenging task. Most existing
approaches rely heavily on identity-sensitive information, such as facial
expressions and speech, which raises concerns about personal privacy. To
address this, we introduce the De-identity Multimodal Emotion Recognition and
Reasoning (DEEMO), a novel task designed to enable emotion understanding using
de-identified video and audio inputs. The DEEMO dataset consists of two
subsets: DEEMO-NFBL, which includes rich annotations of Non-Facial Body
Language (NFBL), and DEEMO-MER, an instruction dataset for Multimodal Emotion
Recognition and Reasoning using identity-free cues. This design supports
emotion understanding without compromising identity privacy. In addition, we
propose DEEMO-LLaMA, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates
de-identified audio, video, and textual information to enhance both emotion
recognition and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that DEEMO-LLaMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, outperforming existing MLLMs by a
significant margin, achieving 74.49% accuracy and 74.45% F1-score in
de-identity emotion recognition, and 6.20 clue overlap and 7.66 label overlap
in de-identity emotion reasoning. Our work contributes to ethical AI by

Abstract: Current point-based approaches encounter limitations in scalability and
rendering quality when using large 3D point cloud maps because using them
directly for novel view synthesis (NVS) leads to degraded visualizations. We
identify the primary issue behind these low-quality renderings as a visibility
mismatch between geometry and appearance, stemming from using these two
modalities together. To address this problem, we present CE-NPBG, a new
approach for novel view synthesis (NVS) in large-scale autonomous driving
scenes. Our method is a neural point-based technique that leverages two
modalities: posed images (cameras) and synchronized raw 3D point clouds
(LiDAR). We first employ a connectivity relationship graph between appearance
and geometry, which retrieves points from a large 3D point cloud map observed
from the current camera perspective and uses them for rendering. By leveraging
this connectivity, our method significantly improves rendering quality and
enhances run-time and scalability by using only a small subset of points from
the large 3D point cloud map. Our approach associates neural descriptors with
the points and uses them to synthesize views. To enhance the encoding of these
descriptors and elevate rendering quality, we propose a joint adversarial and
point rasterization training. During training, we pair an image-synthesizer
network with a multi-resolution discriminator. At inference, we decouple them
and use the image-synthesizer to generate novel views. We also integrate our
proposal into the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting work to highlight its benefits
for improved rendering and scalability.

Conclusion: 通过综合分析，为6D物体姿态估计的泛化提供了可行的建议。

Abstract: Object pose estimation enables a variety of tasks in computer vision and
robotics, including scene understanding and robotic grasping. The complexity of
a pose estimation task depends on the unknown variables related to the target
object. While instance-level methods already excel for opaque and Lambertian
objects, category-level and open-set methods, where texture, shape, and size
are partially or entirely unknown, still struggle with these basic material
properties. Since texture is unknown in these scenarios, it cannot be used for
disambiguating object symmetries, another core challenge of 6D object pose
estimation. The complexity of estimating 6D poses with such a manifold of
unknowns led to various datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithmic solutions.
This paper compares datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithms for solving 6D
pose estimation on the category-level. Based on this comparison, we analyze how
to bridge category-level and open-set object pose estimation to reach
generalization and provide actionable recommendations.

Abstract: End-to-end Transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have demonstrated strong
detection performance. However, domain generalization (DG) research has
primarily focused on convolutional neural network (CNN)-based detectors, while
paying little attention to enhancing the robustness of DETRs. In this letter,
we introduce a Domain Generalized DEtection TRansformer (DG-DETR), a simple,
effective, and plug-and-play method that improves out-of-distribution (OOD)
robustness for DETRs. Specifically, we propose a novel domain-agnostic query
selection strategy that removes domain-induced biases from object queries via
orthogonal projection onto the instance-specific style space. Additionally, we
leverage a wavelet decomposition to disentangle features into domain-invariant
and domain-specific components, enabling synthesis of diverse latent styles
while preserving the semantic features of objects. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of DG-DETR. Our code is available at
https://github.com/sminhwang/DG-DETR.

research topic in 3D computer vision. Recently, learning-to-sample methods have
garnered growing interest from the community, particularly for their ability to
be jointly trained with downstream tasks. However, previous learning-based
sampling methods either lead to unrecognizable sampling patterns by generating
a new point cloud or biased sampled results by focusing excessively on sharp
edge details. Moreover, they all overlook the natural variations in point
distribution across different shapes, applying a similar sampling strategy to
all point clouds. In this paper, we propose a Sparse Attention Map and
Bin-based Learning method (termed SAMBLE) to learn shape-specific sampling
strategies for point cloud shapes. SAMBLE effectively achieves an improved
balance between sampling edge points for local details and preserving
uniformity in the global shape, resulting in superior performance across
multiple common point cloud downstream tasks, even in scenarios with few-point
sampling.

*Sangmin Kim,Seunguk Do,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: ShowMak3r是一个动态辐射场重建管道，用于从视频片段中重建和编辑复杂场景，如电视节目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电视节目等娱乐视频的动态辐射场重建面临演员遮挡、复杂场景和小基线视图等挑战。

Method: ShowMak3r包含3DLocator模块定位演员、ShotMatcher模块跟踪演员，以及动态恢复表情的面部拟合网络。

Result: 在Sitcoms3D数据集上，ShowMak3r能重建场景并支持合成镜头、演员重定位等应用。

Conclusion: ShowMak3r为复杂视频场景的重建和编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic radiance fields from video clips is challenging,
especially when entertainment videos like TV shows are given. Many challenges
make the reconstruction difficult due to (1) actors occluding with each other
and having diverse facial expressions, (2) cluttered stages, and (3) small
baseline views or sudden shot changes. To address these issues, we present
ShowMak3r, a comprehensive reconstruction pipeline that allows the editing of
scenes like how video clips are made in a production control room. In
ShowMak3r, a 3DLocator module locates recovered actors on the stage using depth
prior and estimates unseen human poses via interpolation. The proposed
ShotMatcher module then tracks the actors under shot changes. Furthermore,
ShowMak3r introduces a face-fitting network that dynamically recovers the
actors' expressions. Experiments on Sitcoms3D dataset show that our pipeline
can reassemble TV show scenes with new cameras at different timestamps. We also
demonstrate that ShowMak3r enables interesting applications such as synthetic
shot-making, actor relocation, insertion, deletion, and pose manipulation.

*Daniele Rege Cambrin,Luca Colomba,Paolo Garza*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种名为Magnifier的新方法，通过双编码器（局部和全局）在有限数据下提升图像分割性能，平均IoU提高2.65%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 危机管理和遥感中，图像分割对灾难响应至关重要，但数据稀缺和缺乏基准数据集限制了神经网络的训练能力。

Method: Magnifier通过双编码器（局部和全局）在不同粒度上分析输入数据，扩展现有编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 在相同输入图像下，Magnifier提取更多信息，平均IoU提高2.65%，且计算量（GFLOPs）减半。

Conclusion: Magnifier在有限数据下显著提升分割性能，适用于现有架构，计算效率高。

Abstract: In crisis management and remote sensing, image segmentation plays a crucial
role, enabling tasks like disaster response and emergency planning by analyzing
visual data. Neural networks are able to analyze satellite acquisitions and
determine which areas were affected by a catastrophic event. The problem in
their development in this context is the data scarcity and the lack of
extensive benchmark datasets, limiting the capabilities of training large
neural network models. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology, namely
Magnifier, to improve segmentation performance with limited data availability.
The Magnifier methodology is applicable to any existing encoder-decoder
architecture, as it extends a model by merging information at different
contextual levels through a dual-encoder approach: a local and global encoder.
Magnifier analyzes the input data twice using the dual-encoder approach. In
particular, the local and global encoders extract information from the same
input at different granularities. This allows Magnifier to extract more
information than the other approaches given the same set of input images.
Magnifier improves the quality of the results of +2.65% on average IoU while
leading to a restrained increase in terms of the number of trainable parameters
compared to the original model. We evaluated our proposed approach with
state-of-the-art burned area segmentation models, demonstrating, on average,
comparable or better performances in less than half of the GFLOPs.

Conclusion: 研究为未来开发动态可配置图像分析系统奠定了基础，同时为排除特定数据领域的通用网络提供了性能优化方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a concept of neural network specialization via
task-specific domain constraining, aimed at enhancing network performance on
data subspace in which the network operates. The study presents experiments on
training specialists for image classification and object detection tasks. The
results demonstrate that specialization can enhance a generalist's accuracy
even without additional data or changing training regimes: solely by
constraining class label space in which the network performs. Theoretical and
experimental analyses indicate that effective specialization requires modifying
traditional fine-tuning methods and constraining data space to semantically
coherent subsets. The specialist extraction phase before tuning the network is
proposed for maximal performance gains. We also provide analysis of the
evolution of the feature space during specialization. This study paves way to
future research for developing more advanced dynamically configurable image
analysis systems, where computations depend on the specific input.
Additionally, the proposed methods can help improve system performance in
scenarios where certain data domains should be excluded from consideration of
the generalist network.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种通用的变化检测网络（CANet），通过共享模块和轻量级适配器解决数据集间的分布和标注差异，提高了泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法针对特定数据集训练，泛化能力差，无法适应不同数据集间的分布和标注差异。

Method: CANet包含共享学习模块和轻量级适配器，引入变化区域掩码（ICM）和数据集特定的批归一化层。

Result: CANet在多个数据集上表现优异，泛化能力强，训练成本低（仅更新4.1%-7.7%参数）。

Conclusion: CANet是一种高效、通用的变化检测方法，适用于多数据集场景。

Abstract: Deep learning methods have shown promising performances in remote sensing
image change detection (CD). However, existing methods usually train a
dataset-specific deep network for each dataset. Due to the significant
differences in the data distribution and labeling between various datasets, the
trained dataset-specific deep network has poor generalization performances on
other datasets. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a change adapter
network (CANet) for a more universal and generalized CD. CANet contains
dataset-shared and dataset-specific learning modules. The former explores the
discriminative features of images, and the latter designs a lightweight adapter
model, to deal with the characteristics of different datasets in data
distribution and labeling. The lightweight adapter can quickly generalize the
deep network for new CD tasks with a small computation cost. Specifically, this
paper proposes an interesting change region mask (ICM) in the adapter, which
can adaptively focus on interested change objects and decrease the influence of
labeling differences in various datasets. Moreover, CANet adopts a unique batch
normalization layer for each dataset to deal with data distribution
differences. Compared with existing deep learning methods, CANet can achieve
satisfactory CD performances on various datasets simultaneously. Experimental
results on several public datasets have verified the effectiveness and
advantages of the proposed CANet on CD. CANet has a stronger generalization
ability, smaller training costs (merely updating 4.1%-7.7% parameters), and
better performances under limited training datasets than other deep learning
methods, which also can be flexibly inserted with existing deep models.

Motivation: DDPM虽然能生成高质量图像，但未充分利用像素间的局部关系，HDM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 在DDPM的扩散和生成公式中引入二维热方程的离散形式，实现像素级操作。

Result: HDM生成的图像质量优于DDPM、CDM、LDM和VQGAN等模型。

Conclusion: HDM通过像素级操作显著提升了图像生成质量。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) achieve high-quality image
generation without adversarial training, but they process images as a whole.
Since adjacent pixels are highly likely to belong to the same object, we
propose the Heat Diffusion Model (HDM) to further preserve image details and
generate more realistic images. HDM is a model that incorporates pixel-level
operations while maintaining the same training process as DDPM. In HDM, the
discrete form of the two-dimensional heat equation is integrated into the
diffusion and generation formulas of DDPM, enabling the model to compute
relationships between neighboring pixels during image processing. Our
experiments demonstrate that HDM can generate higher-quality samples compared
to models such as DDPM, Consistency Diffusion Models (CDM), Latent Diffusion
Models (LDM), and Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角驾驶场景视频采集成本高且困难，现有生成模型质量差且缺乏时空一致性，限制了其在感知任务中的应用。

Method: DiVE采用扩散变换器框架，结合统一的跨注意力机制和SketchFormer，引入无参数增加的视角膨胀注意力机制，确保多视角一致性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，DiVE实现了最先进的性能，生成的照片级真实视频具有出色的时间和跨视角一致性。

Conclusion: DiVE通过创新方法解决了多条件输入和高分辨率渲染的挑战，显著提升了生成视频的质量和效率。

Abstract: Collecting multi-view driving scenario videos to enhance the performance of
3D visual perception tasks presents significant challenges and incurs
substantial costs, making generative models for realistic data an appealing
alternative. Yet, the videos generated by recent works suffer from poor quality
and spatiotemporal consistency, undermining their utility in advancing
perception tasks under driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DiVE,
a diffusion transformer-based generative framework meticulously engineered to
produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent, and cross-view consistent
multi-view videos, aligning seamlessly with bird's-eye view layouts and textual
descriptions. DiVE leverages a unified cross-attention and a SketchFormer to
exert precise control over multimodal data, while incorporating a view-inflated
attention mechanism that adds no extra parameters, thereby guaranteeing
consistency across views. Despite these advancements, synthesizing
high-resolution videos under multimodal constraints introduces dual challenges:
investigating the optimal classifier-free guidance coniguration under intricate
multi-condition inputs and mitigating excessive computational latency in
high-resolution rendering--both of which remain underexplored in prior
researches. To resolve these limitations, we introduce two innovations:
Multi-Control Auxiliary Branch Distillation, which streamlines multi-condition
CFG selection while circumventing high computational overhead, and Resolution
Progressive Sampling, a training-free acceleration strategy that staggers
resolution scaling to reduce high latency due to high resolution. These
innovations collectively achieve a 2.62x speedup with minimal quality
degradation. Evaluated on the nuScenes dataset, DiVE achieves SOTA performance
in multi-view video generation, yielding photorealistic outputs with
exceptional temporal and cross-view coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像分割数据集中存在标注错误，且标注数据稀缺，传统方法复杂且耗时。

Method: NSegment方法仅对分割标签应用弹性变换，并根据样本调整变形强度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了多种先进模型的遥感图像分割性能。

Conclusion: NSegment是一种简单有效的数据增强解决方案，能有效应对标注不一致问题。

Abstract: Labeling errors in remote sensing (RS) image segmentation datasets often
remain implicit and subtle due to ambiguous class boundaries, mixed pixels,
shadows, complex terrain features, and subjective annotator bias. Furthermore,
the scarcity of annotated RS data due to high image acquisition and labeling
costs complicates training noise-robust models. While sophisticated mechanisms
such as label selection or noise correction might address this issue, they tend
to increase training time and add implementation complexity. In this letter, we
propose NSegment-a simple yet effective data augmentation solution to mitigate
this issue. Unlike traditional methods, it applies elastic transformations only
to segmentation labels, varying deformation intensity per sample in each
training epoch to address annotation inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of RS image segmentation
on various state-of-the-art models.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的部分相关视频检索（PRVR）框架，通过捕捉跨模态的双重特性（样本间相关性和样本内冗余性）来提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRVR任务中存在文本和视觉模态之间的语义不对称性，现有方法忽略了样本间相关性和样本内冗余性，导致性能受限。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过系统性利用样本间相关性和样本内冗余性，提出的框架显著提升了PRVR任务的性能。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve the target video
that is partially relevant to the text query. The primary challenge in PRVR
arises from the semantic asymmetry between textual and visual modalities, as
videos often contain substantial content irrelevant to the query. Existing
methods coarsely align paired videos and text queries to construct the semantic
space, neglecting the critical cross-modal dual nature inherent in this task:
inter-sample correlation and intra-sample redundancy. To this end, we propose a
novel PRVR framework to systematically exploit these two characteristics. Our
framework consists of three core modules. First, the Inter Correlation
Enhancement (ICE) module captures inter-sample correlation by identifying
semantically similar yet unpaired text queries and video moments, combining
them to form pseudo-positive pairs for more robust semantic space construction.
Second, the Intra Redundancy Mining (IRM) module mitigates intra-sample
redundancy by mining redundant video moment features and treating them as hard
negative samples, thereby encouraging the model to learn more discriminative
representations. Finally, to reinforce these modules, we introduce the Temporal
Coherence Prediction (TCP) module, which enhances feature discrimination by
training the model to predict the original temporal order of randomly shuffled
video frames and moments. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate
the superiority of our approach compared to previous methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: BARIS-ERA为水下实例分割提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Underwater instance segmentation is challenging due to adverse visual
conditions such as light attenuation, scattering, and color distortion, which
degrade model performance. In this work, we propose BARIS-Decoder
(Boundary-Aware Refinement Decoder for Instance Segmentation), a framework that
enhances segmentation accuracy through feature refinement. To address
underwater degradations, we introduce the Environmental Robust Adapter (ERA),
which efficiently models underwater degradation patterns while reducing
trainable parameters by over 90\% compared to full fine-tuning. The integration
of BARIS-Decoder with ERA-tuning, referred to as BARIS-ERA, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing Mask R-CNN by 3.4 mAP with a Swin-B
backbone and 3.8 mAP with ConvNeXt V2. Our findings demonstrate the
effectiveness of BARIS-ERA in advancing underwater instance segmentation,
providing a robust and efficient solution.

Result: 在多个HFR和人脸识别基准测试中表现优于现有方法，同时计算开销低。

Conclusion: 该框架为异构和同构场景提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) addresses the challenge of matching face
images across different sensing modalities, such as thermal to visible or
near-infrared to visible, expanding the applicability of face recognition
systems in real-world, unconstrained environments. While recent HFR methods
have shown promising results, many rely on computation-intensive architectures,
limiting their practicality for deployment on resource-constrained edge
devices. In this work, we present a lightweight yet effective HFR framework by
adapting a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture originally designed for face
recognition. Our approach enables efficient end-to-end training with minimal
paired heterogeneous data while preserving strong performance on standard RGB
face recognition tasks. This makes it a compelling solution for both
homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple
challenging HFR and face recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining a low
computational overhead.

Result: 研究发现GNNs的决策过程可以有效解释，但其深层推理与人类感知不完全一致。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了GNNs的可解释性潜力，同时指出了其与人类认知的差异，尤其是在深层网络中。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative to
convolutional approaches for vision tasks such as image classification,
leveraging patch-based representations instead of raw pixels. These methods
construct graphs where image patches serve as nodes, and edges are established
based on patch similarity or classification relevance. Despite their
efficiency, the explainability of GNN-based vision models remains
underexplored, even though graphs are naturally interpretable. In this work, we
analyze the semantic consistency of the graphs formed at different layers of
GNN-based image classifiers, focusing on how well they preserve object
structures and meaningful relationships. A comprehensive analysis is presented
by quantifying the extent to which inter-layer graph connections reflect
semantic similarity and spatial coherence. Explanations from standard and
adversarial settings are also compared to assess whether they reflect the
classifiers' robustness. Additionally, we visualize the flow of information
across layers through heatmap-based visualization techniques, thereby
highlighting the models' explainability. Our findings demonstrate that the
decision-making processes of these models can be effectively explained, while
also revealing that their reasoning does not necessarily align with human
perception, especially in deeper layers.

Result: 最佳模型在夜间条件下达到85.90%的准确率，整体准确率为97.01%。

Conclusion: 结合域适应和高效对比学习可构建实用的资源高效天气分类系统。

Abstract: Accurate weather classification from low-quality traffic camera imagery
remains a challenging task, particularly under adverse nighttime conditions. In
this study, we propose a scalable framework that combines generative domain
adaptation with efficient contrastive learning to enhance classification
performance. Using CycleGAN-based domain translation, we improve the quality of
nighttime images, enabling better feature extraction by downstream models.
While the baseline EVA-02 model employing CLIP-based contrastive loss achieves
an overall accuracy of 96.55\%, it exhibits a significant performance gap
between daytime (97.21\%) and nighttime conditions (63.40\%). Replacing CLIP
with the lightweight SigLIP-2 (Sigmoid contrastive loss) achieves a competitive
overall accuracy of 94.00\%, with substantial improvements in nighttime
performance (85.90\% accuracy). The combination of Vision-SigLIP-2,
Text-SigLIP-2, CycleGAN, and contrastive training achieves the best nighttime
accuracy (85.90\%) among all models tested, while EVA-02 with CycleGAN
maintains the highest overall accuracy (97.01\%) and per-class accuracies.
These findings demonstrate the potential of combining domain adaptation and
efficient contrastive learning to build practical, resource-efficient weather
classification systems for intelligent transportation infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）虽能减少辐射，但会降低图像质量并产生金属伪影。现有深度学习方法在多尺度信息利用和模型存储方面存在不足。

Method: 设计了PMSRNet，结合多尺度稀疏框架，利用PSATG和MSFuM模块实现多尺度信息融合；还提出PDuMSRNet框架，通过提示引导策略实现单模型多剂量适应。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在多种剂量水平下优于现有LDMAR方法。

Conclusion: PMSRNet和PDuMSRNet有效解决了LDCT重建和金属伪影减少问题，具有多尺度信息利用和单模型多剂量适应的优势。

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) is capable of reducing X-ray radiation exposure, but it
will potentially degrade image quality, even yields metal artifacts at the case
of metallic implants. For simultaneous LDCT reconstruction and metal artifact
reduction (LDMAR), existing deep learning-based efforts face two main
limitations: i) the network design neglects multi-scale and within-scale
information; ii) training a distinct model for each dose necessitates
significant storage space for multiple doses. To fill these gaps, we propose a
prompt guiding multi-scale adaptive sparse representation-driven network,
abbreviated as PMSRNet, for LDMAR task. Specifically, we construct PMSRNet
inspired from multi-scale sparsifying frames, and it can simultaneously employ
within-scale characteristics and cross-scale complementarity owing to an
elaborated prompt guiding scale-adaptive threshold generator (PSATG) and a
built multi-scale coefficient fusion module (MSFuM). The PSATG can adaptively
capture multiple contextual information to generate more faithful thresholds,
achieved by fusing features from local, regional, and global levels.
Furthermore, we elaborate a model interpretable dual domain LDMAR framework
called PDuMSRNet, and train single model with a prompt guiding strategy for
multiple dose levels. We build a prompt guiding module, whose input contains
dose level, metal mask and input instance, to provide various guiding
information, allowing a single model to accommodate various CT dose settings.
Extensive experiments at various dose levels demonstrate that the proposed
methods outperform the state-of-the-art LDMAR methods.

Abstract: Automatic extraction of chemical structures from scientific literature plays
a crucial role in accelerating research across fields ranging from drug
discovery to materials science. Patent documents, in particular, contain
molecular information in visual form, which is often inaccessible through
traditional text-based searches. In this work, we introduce SubGrapher, a
method for the visual fingerprinting of chemical structure images. Unlike
conventional Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) models that attempt
to reconstruct full molecular graphs, SubGrapher focuses on extracting
molecular fingerprints directly from chemical structure images. Using
learning-based instance segmentation, SubGrapher identifies functional groups
and carbon backbones, constructing a substructure-based fingerprint that
enables chemical structure retrieval. Our approach is evaluated against
state-of-the-art OCSR and fingerprinting methods, demonstrating superior
retrieval performance and robustness across diverse molecular depictions. The
dataset, models, and code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of out-of-distribution (OoD) objects, herein referred to
as anomalies, is crucial for the reliable deployment of semantic segmentation
models in open-set, safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving.
Current anomalous segmentation benchmarks predominantly focus on favorable
weather conditions, resulting in untrustworthy evaluations that overlook the
risks posed by diverse meteorological conditions in open-set environments, such
as low illumination, dense fog, and heavy rain. To bridge this gap, this paper
introduces the ComsAmy, a challenging benchmark specifically designed for
open-set anomaly segmentation in complex scenarios. ComsAmy encompasses a wide
spectrum of adverse weather conditions, dynamic driving environments, and
diverse anomaly types to comprehensively evaluate the model performance in
realistic open-world scenarios. Our extensive evaluation of several
state-of-the-art anomalous segmentation models reveals that existing methods
demonstrate significant deficiencies in such challenging scenarios,
highlighting their serious safety risks for real-world deployment. To solve
that, we propose a novel energy-entropy learning (EEL) strategy that integrates
the complementary information from energy and entropy to bolster the robustness
of anomaly segmentation under complex open-world environments. Additionally, a
diffusion-based anomalous training data synthesizer is proposed to generate
diverse and high-quality anomalous images to enhance the existing copy-paste
training data synthesizer. Extensive experimental results on both public and
ComsAmy benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed diffusion-based synthesizer
with energy and entropy learning (DiffEEL) serves as an effective and
generalizable plug-and-play method to enhance existing models, yielding an
average improvement of around 4.96% in $\rm{AUPRC}$ and 9.87% in

Abstract: The increasing demand for aquaculture production necessitates the development
of innovative, intelligent tools to effectively monitor and manage fish health
and welfare. While non-invasive video monitoring has become a common practice
in finfish aquaculture, existing intelligent monitoring methods predominantly
focus on assessing body condition or fish swimming patterns and are often
developed and evaluated in controlled tank environments, without demonstrating
their applicability to real-world aquaculture settings in open sea farms. This
underscores the necessity for methods that can monitor physiological traits
directly within the production environment of sea fish farms. To this end, we
have developed a computer vision method for monitoring ventilation rates of
Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which was specifically designed for videos
recorded in the production environment of commercial sea fish farms using the
existing infrastructure. Our approach uses a fish head detection model, which
classifies the mouth state as either open or closed using a convolutional
neural network. This is followed with multiple object tracking to create
temporal sequences of fish swimming across the field of view of the underwater
video camera to estimate ventilation rates. The method demonstrated high
efficiency, achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.82 between ground
truth and predicted ventilation rates in a test set of 100 fish collected
independently of the training data. By accurately identifying pens where fish
exhibit signs of respiratory distress, our method offers broad applicability
and the potential to transform fish health and welfare monitoring in finfish
aquaculture.

Abstract: Traffic light perception is an essential component of the camera-based
perception system for autonomous vehicles, enabling accurate detection and
interpretation of traffic lights to ensure safe navigation through complex
urban environments. In this work, we propose a modularized perception framework
that integrates state-of-the-art detection models with a novel real-time
association and decision framework, enabling seamless deployment into an
autonomous driving stack. To address the limitations of existing public
datasets, we introduce the ATLAS dataset, which provides comprehensive
annotations of traffic light states and pictograms across diverse environmental
conditions and camera setups. This dataset is publicly available at
https://url.fzi.de/ATLAS. We train and evaluate several state-of-the-art
traffic light detection architectures on ATLAS, demonstrating significant
performance improvements in both accuracy and robustness. Finally, we evaluate
the framework in real-world scenarios by deploying it in an autonomous vehicle
to make decisions at traffic light-controlled intersections, highlighting its
reliability and effectiveness for real-time operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在非拉丁字母的精确渲染上表现不足，RepText旨在解决这一问题。

Result: RepText在实验中优于开源方法，与闭源多语言模型效果相当。

Conclusion: RepText有效提升了多语言文本渲染能力，但仍存在局限性。

Abstract: Although contemporary text-to-image generation models have achieved
remarkable breakthroughs in producing visually appealing images, their capacity
to generate precise and flexible typographic elements, especially non-Latin
alphabets, remains constrained. To address these limitations, we start from an
naive assumption that text understanding is only a sufficient condition for
text rendering, but not a necessary condition. Based on this, we present
RepText, which aims to empower pre-trained monolingual text-to-image generation
models with the ability to accurately render, or more precisely, replicate,
multilingual visual text in user-specified fonts, without the need to really
understand them. Specifically, we adopt the setting from ControlNet and
additionally integrate language agnostic glyph and position of rendered text to
enable generating harmonized visual text, allowing users to customize text
content, font and position on their needs. To improve accuracy, a text
perceptual loss is employed along with the diffusion loss. Furthermore, to
stabilize rendering process, at the inference phase, we directly initialize
with noisy glyph latent instead of random initialization, and adopt region
masks to restrict the feature injection to only the text region to avoid
distortion of the background. We conducted extensive experiments to verify the
effectiveness of our RepText relative to existing works, our approach
outperforms existing open-source methods and achieves comparable results to
native multi-language closed-source models. To be more fair, we also
exhaustively discuss its limitations in the end.

Method: 通过提供包含711次火车驾驶员性能测量的新数据集，涵盖不同速度、障碍物大小和保护系统等因素。

Result: 数据集包括反应时间和障碍物距离的测量值，为研究、标准化和监管提供支持。

Conclusion: 论文通过公开数据集为障碍检测性能量化提供了重要资源，促进了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Points 2.1.4(b), 2.4.2(b) and 2.4.3(b) in Annex I of Implementing Regulation
(EU) No. 402/2013 allow a simplified approach for the safety approval of
computer vision systems for driverless trains, if they have 'similar' functions
and interfaces as the replaced human driver. The human driver is not replaced
one-to-one by a technical system - only a limited set of cognitive functions
are replaced. However, performance in the most challenging function, obstacle
detection, is difficult to quantify due to the deficiency of published
measurement results. This article summarizes the data published so far. This
article also goes a long way to remedy this situation by providing a new public
and anonymized dataset of 711 train driver performance measurements from
controlled experiments. The measurements are made for different speeds,
obstacle sizes, train protection systems and obstacle color contrasts
respectively. The measured values are reaction time and distance to the
obstacle. The goal of this paper is an unbiased and exhaustive description of
the presented dataset for research, standardization and regulation. Further

Abstract: Global variations in terrain appearance raise a major challenge for satellite
image analysis, leading to poor model performance when training on locations
that differ from those encountered at test time. This remains true even with
recent large global datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
domain-generalization framework for satellite images. Instead of trying to
learn a single generalizable model, we train one expert model per training
domain, while learning experts' similarity and encouraging similar experts to
be consistent. A model selection module then identifies the most suitable
experts for a given test sample and aggregates their predictions. Experiments
on four datasets (DynamicEarthNet, MUDS, OSCD, and FMoW) demonstrate consistent
gains over existing domain generalization and adaptation methods. Our code is

Abstract: The presence of species provides key insights into the ecological properties
of a location such as land cover, climatic conditions or even soil properties.
We propose a method to predict such ecological properties directly from remote
sensing (RS) images by aligning them with species habitat descriptions. We
introduce the EcoWikiRS dataset, consisting of high-resolution aerial images,
the corresponding geolocated species observations, and, for each species, the
textual descriptions of their habitat from Wikipedia. EcoWikiRS offers a
scalable way of supervision for RS vision language models (RS-VLMs) for
ecology. This is a setting with weak and noisy supervision, where, for
instance, some text may describe properties that are specific only to part of
the species' niche or is irrelevant to a specific image. We tackle this by
proposing WINCEL, a weighted version of the InfoNCE loss. We evaluate our model
on the task of ecosystem zero-shot classification by following the habitat
definitions from the European Nature Information System (EUNIS). Our results
show that our approach helps in understanding RS images in a more ecologically
meaningful manner. The code and the dataset are available at

Method: 提出显式状态建模方法，结合稀疏遮挡感知注意力机制和级联细化策略，并引入长期动态交互建模方法。

Result: 在RayIoU和mAVE指标上表现优于现有方法，训练时GPU内存使用降至8.7GB。

Conclusion: 显式状态建模方法在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: 3D occupancy and scene flow offer a detailed and dynamic representation of 3D
scene. Recognizing the sparsity and complexity of 3D space, previous
vision-centric methods have employed implicit learning-based approaches to
model spatial and temporal information. However, these approaches struggle to
capture local details and diminish the model's spatial discriminative ability.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel explicit state-based modeling
method designed to leverage the occupied state to renovate the 3D features.
Specifically, we propose a sparse occlusion-aware attention mechanism,
integrated with a cascade refinement strategy, which accurately renovates 3D
features with the guidance of occupied state information. Additionally, we
introduce a novel method for modeling long-term dynamic interactions, which
reduces computational costs and preserves spatial information. Compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods, our efficient explicit renovation strategy
not only delivers superior performance in terms of RayIoU and mAVE for
occupancy and scene flow prediction but also markedly reduces GPU memory usage
during training, bringing it down to 8.7GB. Our code is available on

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过建模连续相机运动为时间依赖的角速度和速度，消除了对初始相机位姿或深度先验的依赖，从而优化NeRF训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF需要精确的预计算相机位姿，现有方法依赖良好的位姿初始化或深度先验，但在大旋转等挑战性场景中表现不佳。

Method: 通过时间依赖的NeRF建模连续相机运动，先学习相机间的相对运动，再通过速度积分和位姿聚合优化全局位姿。

Result: 在Co3D和Scannet数据集上，该方法在相机位姿和深度估计上优于现有方法，且新视角合成性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法通过建模连续相机运动，显著提升了NeRF在复杂场景中的位姿优化能力。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has demonstrated its superior capability to
represent 3D geometry but require accurately precomputed camera poses during
training. To mitigate this requirement, existing methods jointly optimize
camera poses and NeRF often relying on good pose initialisation or depth
priors. However, these approaches struggle in challenging scenarios, such as
large rotations, as they map each camera to a world coordinate system. We
propose a novel method that eliminates prior dependencies by modeling
continuous camera motions as time-dependent angular velocity and velocity.
Relative motions between cameras are learned first via velocity integration,
while camera poses can be obtained by aggregating such relative motions up to a
world coordinate system defined at a single time step within the video.
Specifically, accurate continuous camera movements are learned through a
time-dependent NeRF, which captures local scene geometry and motion by training
from neighboring frames for each time step. The learned motions enable
fine-tuning the NeRF to represent the full scene geometry. Experiments on Co3D
and Scannet show our approach achieves superior camera pose and depth
estimation and comparable novel-view synthesis performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Motivation: 随机裁剪可能导致图像语义偏离原图，影响自监督学习效果，因此需要更稳健的裁剪方法。

Method: 引入两种参数化裁剪方法，以增强自标签的鲁棒性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10分类任务中，新方法比非参数化随机裁剪方法提升2.7%至12.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: 参数化裁剪方法有效提升对比学习的自标签鲁棒性和模型性能。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) approaches have gained great recognition as a very
successful subset of self-supervised learning (SSL) methods. SSL enables
learning from unlabeled data, a crucial step in the advancement of deep
learning, particularly in computer vision (CV), given the plethora of unlabeled
image data. CL works by comparing different random augmentations (e.g.,
different crops) of the same image, thus achieving self-labeling. Nevertheless,
randomly augmenting images and especially random cropping can result in an
image that is semantically very distant from the original and therefore leads
to false labeling, hence undermining the efficacy of the methods. In this
research, two novel parameterized cropping methods are introduced that increase
the robustness of self-labeling and consequently increase the efficacy. The
results show that the use of these methods significantly improves the accuracy
of the model by between 2.7\% and 12.4\% on the downstream task of classifying
CIFAR-10, depending on the crop size compared to that of the non-parameterized
random cropping method.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: HOIGaze是一种基于学习的新方法，用于在扩展现实（XR）中手-物体交互（HOI）期间的视线估计。它通过利用眼、手和头部运动的协调性来优化训练数据，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视线估计方法将所有训练样本视为同等重要，忽略了眼、手和头部运动的协调性。HOIGaze旨在利用这种协调性优化训练数据，提升视线估计的准确性。

Method: 1) 提出分层框架，先识别视觉关注的手，再基于该手估计视线方向；2) 使用跨模态Transformer融合头部和手-物体特征；3) 引入眼-头部协调损失函数优化训练样本。

Result: 在HOT3D和ADT数据集上，HOIGaze平均性能提升15.6%和6.0%，并在眼基活动识别任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 眼-手-头部协调性为视线估计提供了丰富信息，HOIGaze为基于学习的视线估计开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present HOIGaze - a novel learning-based approach for gaze estimation
during hand-object interactions (HOI) in extended reality (XR). HOIGaze
addresses the challenging HOI setting by building on one key insight: The eye,
hand, and head movements are closely coordinated during HOIs and this
coordination can be exploited to identify samples that are most useful for gaze
estimator training - as such, effectively denoising the training data. This
denoising approach is in stark contrast to previous gaze estimation methods
that treated all training samples as equal. Specifically, we propose: 1) a
novel hierarchical framework that first recognises the hand currently visually
attended to and then estimates gaze direction based on the attended hand; 2) a
new gaze estimator that uses cross-modal Transformers to fuse head and
hand-object features extracted using a convolutional neural network and a
spatio-temporal graph convolutional network; and 3) a novel eye-head
coordination loss that upgrades training samples belonging to the coordinated
eye-head movements. We evaluate HOIGaze on the HOT3D and Aria digital twin
(ADT) datasets and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving an average improvement of 15.6% on HOT3D and 6.0% on ADT in
mean angular error. To demonstrate the potential of our method, we further
report significant performance improvements for the sample downstream task of
eye-based activity recognition on ADT. Taken together, our results underline
the significant information content available in eye-hand-head coordination
and, as such, open up an exciting new direction for learning-based gaze
estimation.

Method: 引入BML学习背景运动，结合极线约束优化3D注意力图。

Result: 实验表明AnimateAnywhere能有效学习背景运动，生成生动动画。

Conclusion: AnimateAnywhere无需相机轨迹即可实现高质量背景动画，性能领先。

Abstract: Human image animation aims to generate human videos of given characters and
backgrounds that adhere to the desired pose sequence. However, existing methods
focus more on human actions while neglecting the generation of background,
which typically leads to static results or inharmonious movements. The
community has explored camera pose-guided animation tasks, yet preparing the
camera trajectory is impractical for most entertainment applications and
ordinary users. As a remedy, we present an AnimateAnywhere framework, rousing
the background in human image animation without requirements on camera
trajectories. In particular, based on our key insight that the movement of the
human body often reflects the motion of the background, we introduce a
background motion learner (BML) to learn background motions from human pose
sequences. To encourage the model to learn more accurate cross-frame
correspondences, we further deploy an epipolar constraint on the 3D attention
map. Specifically, the mask used to suppress geometrically unreasonable
attention is carefully constructed by combining an epipolar mask and the
current 3D attention map. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
AnimateAnywhere effectively learns the background motion from human pose
sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance in generating human animation
results with vivid and realistic backgrounds. The source code and model will be
available at https://github.com/liuxiaoyu1104/AnimateAnywhere.

Result: 在URUR、GID和FBP数据集上，mIoU分别提升3.33%、0.66%和0.98%。

Conclusion: SRMF框架有效缓解长尾问题，性能达到最优。

Abstract: The long-tail problem presents a significant challenge to the advancement of
semantic segmentation in ultra-high-resolution (UHR) satellite imagery. While
previous efforts in UHR semantic segmentation have largely focused on
multi-branch network architectures that emphasize multi-scale feature
extraction and fusion, they have often overlooked the importance of addressing
the long-tail issue. In contrast to prior UHR methods that focused on
independent feature extraction, we emphasize data augmentation and multimodal
feature fusion to alleviate the long-tail problem. In this paper, we introduce
SRMF, a novel framework for semantic segmentation in UHR satellite imagery. Our
approach addresses the long-tail class distribution by incorporating a
multi-scale cropping technique alongside a data augmentation strategy based on
semantic reordering and resampling. To further enhance model performance, we
propose a multimodal fusion-based general representation knowledge injection
method, which, for the first time, fuses text and visual features without the
need for individual region text descriptions, extracting more robust features.
Extensive experiments on the URUR, GID, and FBP datasets demonstrate that our
method improves mIoU by 3.33\%, 0.66\%, and 0.98\%, respectively, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at:

Conclusion: Seg2HOI能够通过文本和视觉提示生成未在训练中使用的HOI四元组和交互分割，展示了其灵活性和广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Segmentation to Human-Object Interaction
(\textit{\textbf{Seg2HOI}}) approach, a novel framework that integrates
segmentation-based vision foundation models with the human-object interaction
task, distinguished from traditional detection-based Human-Object Interaction
(HOI) methods. Our approach enhances HOI detection by not only predicting the
standard triplets but also introducing quadruplets, which extend HOI triplets
by including segmentation masks for human-object pairs. More specifically,
Seg2HOI inherits the properties of the vision foundation model (e.g.,
promptable and interactive mechanisms) and incorporates a decoder that applies
these attributes to HOI task. Despite training only for HOI, without additional
training mechanisms for these properties, the framework demonstrates that such
features still operate efficiently. Extensive experiments on two public
benchmark datasets demonstrate that Seg2HOI achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, even in zero-shot scenarios. Lastly, we propose that
Seg2HOI can generate HOI quadruplets and interactive HOI segmentation from
novel text and visual prompts that were not used during training, making it
versatile for a wide range of applications by leveraging this flexibility.

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has achieved remarkable success in
text-to-3D content generation. However, SDS-based methods struggle to maintain
semantic fidelity for user prompts, particularly when involving multiple
objects with intricate interactions. While existing approaches often address 3D
consistency through multiview diffusion model fine-tuning on 3D datasets, this
strategy inadvertently exacerbates text-3D alignment degradation. The
limitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases
during optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment
direction. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel SDS objective,
dubbed as Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD), which integrates
alignment feedback from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our TCSD
leverages cross-modal understanding capabilities of MLLMs to assess and guide
the text-3D correspondence during the optimization. We further develop
3DLLaVA-CRITIC - a fine-tuned MLLM specialized for evaluating multiview text
alignment in 3D generations. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-layout
initialization that significantly accelerates optimization convergence through
semantic-aware spatial configuration. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate
that our framework, CoherenDream, establishes state-of-the-art performance in
text-aligned 3D generation across multiple benchmarks, including T$^3$Bench and
TIFA subset. Qualitative results showcase the superior performance of
CoherenDream in preserving textual consistency and semantic interactions. As
the first study to incorporate MLLMs into SDS optimization, we also conduct
extensive ablation studies to explore optimal MLLM adaptations for 3D
generation tasks.

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种从单目广播视频中推断乒乓球初始旋转和3D轨迹的新方法，仅使用合成数据训练神经网络，无需真实数据，实现了高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析乒乓球运动员技术需要球的3D轨迹和旋转信息，但旋转在标准广播视频中不可直接观察。

Method: 通过2D轨迹推断初始旋转和3D轨迹，仅用合成数据训练神经网络，采用物理正确的数据表示和增强技术。

Result: 旋转分类准确率达92.0%，2D重投影误差为图像对角线的0.19%。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了在单目广播视频中预测旋转和轨迹，且仅需合成数据即可泛化到真实数据。

Abstract: Analyzing a player's technique in table tennis requires knowledge of the
ball's 3D trajectory and spin. While, the spin is not directly observable in
standard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's
trajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin
and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without
ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on
synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically
correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network
naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are
sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for
training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method
for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos,
achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection
error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.

Method: 结合DeeFuser融合模块和三元组损失，采用LoRA微调CLIP-ViT。

Result: 在19个测试子集上平均准确率达89.00%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeeCLIP在鲁棒性和泛化性上表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper introduces DeeCLIP, a novel framework for detecting AI-generated
images using CLIP-ViT and fusion learning. Despite significant advancements in
generative models capable of creating highly photorealistic images, existing
detection methods often struggle to generalize across different models and are
highly sensitive to minor perturbations. To address these challenges, DeeCLIP
incorporates DeeFuser, a fusion module that combines high-level and low-level
features, improving robustness against degradations such as compression and
blurring. Additionally, we apply triplet loss to refine the embedding space,
enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between real and synthetic
content. To further enable lightweight adaptation while preserving pre-trained
knowledge, we adopt parameter-efficient fine-tuning using low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) within the CLIP-ViT backbone. This approach supports effective zero-shot
learning without sacrificing generalization. Trained exclusively on 4-class
ProGAN data, DeeCLIP achieves an average accuracy of 89.00% on 19 test subsets
composed of generative adversarial network (GAN) and diffusion models. Despite
having fewer trainable parameters, DeeCLIP outperforms existing methods,
demonstrating superior robustness against various generative models and
real-world distortions. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理数据偏差时效果有限，且未能充分利用上下文信息。

Method: 设计了因果区域定位模块和因果数据增强模块，生成反事实样本，无需客户端间信息共享。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，FedCAug显著降低了模型对背景的依赖，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedCAug通过因果增强有效提升了联邦学习的性能，同时保护了数据隐私。

Abstract: Federated learning aims to collaboratively model by integrating multi-source
information to obtain a model that can generalize across all client data.
Existing methods often leverage knowledge distillation or data augmentation to
mitigate the negative impact of data bias across clients. However, the limited
performance of teacher models on out-of-distribution samples and the inherent
quality gap between augmented and original data hinder their effectiveness and
they typically fail to leverage the advantages of incorporating rich contextual
information. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Federated
Causal Augmentation method, termed FedCAug, which employs causality-inspired
data augmentation to break the spurious correlation between attributes and
categories. Specifically, it designs a causal region localization module to
accurately identify and decouple the background and objects in the image,
providing rich contextual information for causal data augmentation.
Additionally, it designs a causality-inspired data augmentation module that
integrates causal features and within-client context to generate counterfactual
samples. This significantly enhances data diversity, and the entire process
does not require any information sharing between clients, thereby contributing
to the protection of data privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on three
datasets reveal that FedCAug markedly reduces the model's reliance on
background to predict sample labels, achieving superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种结合自监督学习和深度混合模型（HybMNet）的新方法，用于提高乳腺癌筛查的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量标注医学数据的稀缺性是AI应用于乳腺癌诊断的主要限制，HybMNet旨在减少对大量标注数据的依赖。

Method: 采用两阶段学习：1）自监督预训练（EsViT技术）；2）下游任务训练（结合Swin-T和CNN的HybMNet模型）。

Result: 在CMMD和INbreast数据集上分别达到AUC 0.864和0.889，表现优异。

Conclusion: HybMNet通过结合自监督学习和混合模型，显著提升了乳腺癌检测性能。

Abstract: Purpose: The scarcity of high-quality curated labeled medical training data
remains one of the major limitations in applying artificial intelligence (AI)
systems to breast cancer diagnosis. Deep models for mammogram analysis and mass
(or micro-calcification) detection require training with a large volume of
labeled images, which are often expensive and time-consuming to collect. To
reduce this challenge, we proposed a novel method that leverages
self-supervised learning (SSL) and a deep hybrid model, named \textbf{HybMNet},
which combines local self-attention and fine-grained feature extraction to
enhance breast cancer detection on screening mammograms.
  Approach: Our method employs a two-stage learning process: (1) SSL
Pretraining: We utilize EsViT, a SSL technique, to pretrain a Swin Transformer
(Swin-T) using a limited set of mammograms. The pretrained Swin-T then serves
as the backbone for the downstream task. (2) Downstream Training: The proposed
HybMNet combines the Swin-T backbone with a CNN-based network and a novel
fusion strategy. The Swin-T employs local self-attention to identify
informative patch regions from the high-resolution mammogram, while the
CNN-based network extracts fine-grained local features from the selected
patches. A fusion module then integrates global and local information from both
networks to generate robust predictions. The HybMNet is trained end-to-end,
with the loss function combining the outputs of the Swin-T and CNN modules to
optimize feature extraction and classification performance.
  Results: The proposed method was evaluated for its ability to detect breast
cancer by distinguishing between benign (normal) and malignant mammograms.
Leveraging SSL pretraining and the HybMNet model, it achieved AUC of 0.864 (95%
CI: 0.852, 0.875) on the CMMD dataset and 0.889 (95% CI: 0.875, 0.903) on the
INbreast dataset, highlighting its effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决电影制作中的多角色、复杂互动和视觉特效等挑战，强调跨帧的一致性和连续性。

Method: 1. 使用大型语言模型（LLM）生成详细场景和镜头计划；2. 微调文本到图像生成模型合成高质量关键帧。

Result: 实验表明CineVerse在生成视觉连贯且内容丰富的电影场景方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CineVerse为电影视频合成领域的进一步探索奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present CineVerse, a novel framework for the task of cinematic scene
composition. Similar to traditional multi-shot generation, our task emphasizes
the need for consistency and continuity across frames. However, our task also
focuses on addressing challenges inherent to filmmaking, such as multiple
characters, complex interactions, and visual cinematic effects. In order to
learn to generate such content, we first create the CineVerse dataset. We use
this dataset to train our proposed two-stage approach. First, we prompt a large
language model (LLM) with task-specific instructions to take in a high-level
scene description and generate a detailed plan for the overall setting and
characters, as well as the individual shots. Then, we fine-tune a text-to-image
generation model to synthesize high-quality visual keyframes. Experimental
results demonstrate that CineVerse yields promising improvements in generating
visually coherent and contextually rich movie scenes, paving the way for
further exploration in cinematic video synthesis.

Motivation: 高分辨率乳腺X光片的准确检测对乳腺癌早期诊断至关重要，但多视图分类在医学影像中面临挑战，尤其是处理大规模高分辨率数据时。

Method: 先预训练单视图分类模型，再通过任务特定的提示调谐过程创新性地整合多视图特征学习，仅调谐7%的可训练参数。

Conclusion: MVPT-NET为医学影像任务提供了可扩展的多视图数据集成解决方案，展示了其在乳腺癌检测中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate detection of breast cancer from high-resolution mammograms is
crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Previous studies
have shown the potential of using single-view mammograms for breast cancer
detection. However, incorporating multi-view data can provide more
comprehensive insights. Multi-view classification, especially in medical
imaging, presents unique challenges, particularly when dealing with
large-scale, high-resolution data. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-view
Visual Prompt Tuning Network (MVPT-NET) for analyzing multiple screening
mammograms. We first pretrain a robust single-view classification model on
high-resolution mammograms and then innovatively adapt multi-view feature
learning into a task-specific prompt tuning process. This technique selectively
tunes a minimal set of trainable parameters (7\%) while retaining the
robustness of the pre-trained single-view model, enabling efficient integration
of multi-view data without the need for aggressive downsampling. Our approach
offers an efficient alternative to traditional feature fusion methods,
providing a more robust, scalable, and efficient solution for high-resolution
mammogram analysis. Experimental results on a large multi-institution dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional approaches while
maintaining detection efficiency, achieving an AUROC of 0.852 for
distinguishing between Benign, DCIS, and Invasive classes. This work highlights
the potential of MVPT-NET for medical imaging tasks and provides a scalable
solution for integrating multi-view data in breast cancer detection.

Abstract: The automatic summarization of surgical videos is essential for enhancing
procedural documentation, supporting surgical training, and facilitating
post-operative analysis. This paper presents a novel method at the intersection
of artificial intelligence and medicine, aiming to develop machine learning
models with direct real-world applications in surgical contexts. We propose a
multi-modal framework that leverages recent advancements in computer vision and
large language models to generate comprehensive video summaries. % The approach
is structured in three key stages. First, surgical videos are divided into
clips, and visual features are extracted at the frame level using visual
transformers. This step focuses on detecting tools, tissues, organs, and
surgical actions. Second, the extracted features are transformed into
frame-level captions via large language models. These are then combined with
temporal features, captured using a ViViT-based encoder, to produce clip-level
summaries that reflect the broader context of each video segment. Finally, the
clip-level descriptions are aggregated into a full surgical report using a
dedicated LLM tailored for the summarization task. % We evaluate our method on
the CholecT50 dataset, using instrument and action annotations from 50
laparoscopic videos. The results show strong performance, achieving 96\%
precision in tool detection and a BERT score of 0.74 for temporal context
summarization. This work contributes to the advancement of AI-assisted tools
for surgical reporting, offering a step toward more intelligent and reliable
clinical documentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管H.266/VVC在压缩性能上有显著提升，但仍需满足更高的感知质量需求。AI技术，尤其是深度学习，为视频质量增强提供了新思路。

Method: 基于HEVC压缩视频的Omniscient Network，改进并整合到STD-VVC解码器架构中，利用时空特征和跨频率信息提升视觉质量。

Result: 在多种测试条件下，OVQE-VVC显著提升了PSNR（约0.74 dB至1.2 dB），并节省了约19.6%的比特率。

Conclusion: OVQE-VVC是一种有效的视频质量增强解决方案，适用于H.266/VVC标准。

Abstract: The latest video coding standard H.266/VVC has shown its great improvement in
terms of compression performance when compared to its predecessor HEVC
standard. Though VVC was implemented with many advanced techniques, it still
met the same challenges as its predecessor due to the need for even higher
perceptual quality demand at the decoder side as well as the compression
performance at the encoder side. The advancement of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) technology, notably the deep learning-based video quality enhancement
methods, was shown to be a promising approach to improving the perceptual
quality experience. In this paper, we propose a novel Omniscient video quality
enhancement Network for VVC compressed Videos. The Omniscient Network for
compressed video quality enhancement was originally designed for HEVC
compressed videos in which not only the spatial-temporal features but also
cross-frequencies information were employed to augment the visual quality.
Inspired by this work, we propose a modification of the OVQE model and
integrate it into the lasted STD-VVC (Standard Versatile Video Coding) decoder
architecture. As assessed in a rich set of test conditions, the proposed
OVQE-VVC solution is able to achieve significant PSNR improvement, notably
around 0.74 dB and up to 1.2 dB with respect to the original STD-VVC codec.
This also corresponds to around 19.6% of bitrate saving while keeping a similar
quality observation.

Result: 在Replica和FAST-LIVO2数据集上实现了优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: Mesh-Learner在兼容性和性能上表现优异，适用于多种基于光栅化管道的任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a 3D reconstruction and rendering framework termed
Mesh-Learner that is natively compatible with traditional rasterization
pipelines. It integrates mesh and spherical harmonic (SH) texture (i.e.,
texture filled with SH coefficients) into the learning process to learn each
mesh s view-dependent radiance end-to-end. Images are rendered by interpolating
surrounding SH Texels at each pixel s sampling point using a novel
interpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated
to the related SH Texels in SH textures. Mesh-Learner exploits graphic features
of rasterization pipeline (texture sampling, deferred rendering) to render,
which makes Mesh-Learner naturally compatible with tools (e.g., Blender) and
tasks (e.g., 3D reconstruction, scene rendering, reinforcement learning for
robotics) that are based on rasterization pipelines. Our system can train vast,
unlimited scenes because we transfer only the SH textures within the frustum to
the GPU for training. At other times, the SH textures are stored in CPU RAM,
which results in moderate GPU memory usage. The rendering results on
interpolation and extrapolation sequences in the Replica and FAST-LIVO2
datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting and M2-Mapping). To

Conclusion: Shopformer是一种高效、隐私友好的商店盗窃检测方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Shoplifting remains a costly issue for the retail sector, but traditional
surveillance systems, which are mostly based on human monitoring, are still
largely ineffective, with only about 2% of shoplifters being arrested. Existing
AI-based approaches rely on pixel-level video analysis which raises privacy
concerns, is sensitive to environmental variations, and demands significant
computational resources. To address these limitations, we introduce Shopformer,
a novel transformer-based model that detects shoplifting by analyzing pose
sequences rather than raw video. We propose a custom tokenization strategy that
converts pose sequences into compact embeddings for efficient transformer
processing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pose-sequence-based
transformer model for shoplifting detection. Evaluated on real-world pose data,
our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection models, offering a
privacy-preserving, and scalable solution for real-time retail surveillance.

Conclusion: 该方法为政策制定者提供了高效的工具，支持农业管理和政策合规性评估。

Abstract: Effective weed management is crucial for improving agricultural productivity,
as weeds compete with crops for vital resources like nutrients and water.
Accurate maps of weed management methods are essential for policymakers to
assess farmer practices, evaluate impacts on vegetation health, biodiversity,
and climate, as well as ensure compliance with policies and subsidies. However,
monitoring weed management methods is challenging as commonly rely on on-ground
field surveys, which are often costly, time-consuming and subject to delays. In
order to tackle this problem, we leverage Earth Observation (EO) data and
Machine Learning (ML). Specifically, we developed an ML approach for mapping
four distinct weed management methods (Mowing, Tillage, Chemical-spraying, and
No practice) in orchards using satellite image time series (SITS) data from two
different sources: Sentinel-2 (S2) and PlanetScope (PS). The findings
demonstrate the potential of ML-driven remote sensing to enhance the efficiency
and accuracy of weed management mapping in orchards.

application on the soils of four different crop types in Thessaly, Greece.
Furthermore, Machine Learning (ML) models (namely Random Forest, k-NN, Gradient

Result: 在多种空间推理基准测试中表现更优，对未见问题泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 该研究结合视觉基础模型和大型语言模型，为3D空间推理开辟新方向。

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D spatial reasoning explore data-driven approaches and
achieve enhanced spatial reasoning performance with reinforcement learning
(RL). However, these methods typically perform spatial reasoning in an implicit
manner, and it remains underexplored whether the acquired 3D knowledge
generalizes to unseen question types at any stage of the training. In this work
we introduce SpatialReasoner, a novel large vision-language model (LVLM) that
address 3D spatial reasoning with explicit 3D representations shared between
stages -- 3D perception, computation, and reasoning. Explicit 3D
representations provide a coherent interface that supports advanced 3D spatial

TLDR: LIRM是一种基于Transformer的架构，能够在一秒内联合重建高质量的形状、材质和辐射场，解决了现有稀疏视图重建模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏视图重建模型（LRMs）在重建未见部分、恢复光泽外观和生成可重光照3D内容方面表现不佳，LIRM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: LIRM通过引入更新模型、六平面神经SDF表示和神经方向嵌入机制，改进了多视图3D重建框架。

Result: LIRM在几何和重光照精度上优于基于优化的密集视图逆渲染方法，且推理时间大幅缩短。

Conclusion: LIRM为多视图3D重建提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，显著提升了重建质量和速度。

Abstract: We present Large Inverse Rendering Model (LIRM), a transformer architecture
that jointly reconstructs high-quality shape, materials, and radiance fields
with view-dependent effects in less than a second. Our model builds upon the
recent Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) that achieve state-of-the-art
sparse-view reconstruction quality. However, existing LRMs struggle to
reconstruct unseen parts accurately and cannot recover glossy appearance or
generate relightable 3D contents that can be consumed by standard Graphics
engines. To address these limitations, we make three key technical
contributions to build a more practical multi-view 3D reconstruction framework.
First, we introduce an update model that allows us to progressively add more
input views to improve our reconstruction. Second, we propose a hexa-plane
neural SDF representation to better recover detailed textures, geometry and
material parameters. Third, we develop a novel neural directional-embedding
mechanism to handle view-dependent effects. Trained on a large-scale shape and
material dataset with a tailored coarse-to-fine training scheme, our model
achieves compelling results. It compares favorably to optimization-based
dense-view inverse rendering methods in terms of geometry and relighting
accuracy, while requiring only a fraction of the inference time.

TLDR: CODrone是一个面向无人机（UAV）的定向目标检测数据集，旨在解决现有数据集在真实飞行场景中泛化能力不足的问题，并通过多城市、多光照条件下的图像提升基准的真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机定向目标检测数据集通常针对特定任务设计，泛化能力有限，无法充分验证算法在实际环境中的有效性。

Method: 通过识别当前数据集的四大局限（低分辨率、有限类别、单视角成像、受限飞行高度），提出改进方案，并构建包含多城市、多光照条件的CODrone数据集。

Result: 实验基于22种经典或SOTA方法验证了CODrone的实用性，揭示了无人机定向目标检测的关键瓶颈和机遇。

Conclusion: CODrone填补了无人机定向目标检测的数据空白，提供了泛化能力更强的基准，更贴合实际应用和未来算法发展。

Abstract: Applications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in logistics, agricultural
automation, urban management, and emergency response are highly dependent on
oriented object detection (OOD) to enhance visual perception. Although existing
datasets for OOD in UAV provide valuable resources, they are often designed for
specific downstream tasks.Consequently, they exhibit limited generalization
performance in real flight scenarios and fail to thoroughly demonstrate
algorithm effectiveness in practical environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we introduce CODrone, a comprehensive oriented object detection dataset for
UAVs that accurately reflects real-world conditions. It also serves as a new
benchmark designed to align with downstream task requirements, ensuring greater
applicability and robustness in UAV-based OOD.Based on application
requirements, we identify four key limitations in current UAV OOD datasets-low
image resolution, limited object categories, single-view imaging, and
restricted flight altitudes-and propose corresponding improvements to enhance
their applicability and robustness.Furthermore, CODrone contains a broad
spectrum of annotated images collected from multiple cities under various
lighting conditions, enhancing the realism of the benchmark. To rigorously
evaluate CODrone as a new benchmark and gain deeper insights into the novel
challenges it presents, we conduct a series of experiments based on 22
classical or SOTA methods.Our evaluation not only assesses the effectiveness of
CODrone in real-world scenarios but also highlights key bottlenecks and
opportunities to advance OOD in UAV applications.Overall, CODrone fills the
data gap in OOD from UAV perspective and provides a benchmark with enhanced
generalization capability, better aligning with practical applications and
future algorithm development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分析中数据分散存储和多中心数据整合的挑战，同时避免存储大量原始数据的需求。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏（KD）技术，利用过去任务生成的图像指导后续任务的模型训练，提升模型性能和收敛速度。

Result: 在PI-CAI数据集及其他医学影像和基准数据集（如CIFAR-10）上验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: KD是一种有前景的增量学习技术，适用于医学图像分析，尤其适合多中心数据和小规模存储场景。

Abstract: This paper proposes an Incremental Learning (IL) approach to enhance the
accuracy and efficiency of deep learning models in analyzing T2-weighted (T2w)
MRI medical images prostate cancer detection using the PI-CAI dataset. We used
multiple health centers' artificial intelligence and radiology data, focused on
different tasks that looked at prostate cancer detection using MRI (PI-CAI). We
utilized Knowledge Distillation (KD), as it employs generated images from past
tasks to guide the training of models for subsequent tasks. The approach
yielded improved performance and faster convergence of the models. To
demonstrate the versatility and robustness of our approach, we evaluated it on
the PI-CAI dataset, a diverse set of medical imaging modalities including OCT
and PathMNIST, and the benchmark continual learning dataset CIFAR-10. Our
results indicate that KD can be a promising technique for IL in medical image
analysis in which data is sourced from individual health centers and the
storage of large datasets is not feasible. By using generated images from prior
tasks, our method enables the model to retain and apply previously acquired
knowledge without direct access to the original data.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种结合单目深度和法线先验的SfM方法，显著提升了在极端视角变化下的性能，并解决了对称性导致的错误关联问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM系统在极端视角变化、低重叠或高对称性场景中容易失败，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 通过深度神经网络推断单目深度和法线先验，并将其与多视图约束紧密结合。

Result: 在极端视角变化下显著优于现有方法，并能可靠重建具有挑战性的室内环境。

Conclusion: 该方法对先验误差鲁棒，能适应不同模型，未来可受益于单目深度和法线估计的进步。

Abstract: While Structure-from-Motion (SfM) has seen much progress over the years,
state-of-the-art systems are prone to failure when facing extreme viewpoint
changes in low-overlap, low-parallax or high-symmetry scenarios. Because
capturing images that avoid these pitfalls is challenging, this severely limits
the wider use of SfM, especially by non-expert users. We overcome these
limitations by augmenting the classical SfM paradigm with monocular depth and
normal priors inferred by deep neural networks. Thanks to a tight integration
of monocular and multi-view constraints, our approach significantly outperforms
existing ones under extreme viewpoint changes, while maintaining strong
performance in standard conditions. We also show that monocular priors can help
reject faulty associations due to symmetries, which is a long-standing problem
for SfM. This makes our approach the first capable of reliably reconstructing
challenging indoor environments from few images. Through principled uncertainty
propagation, it is robust to errors in the priors, can handle priors inferred
by different models with little tuning, and will thus easily benefit from
future progress in monocular depth and normal estimation. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/cvg/mpsfm.

Motivation: 实时视频理解在自动驾驶和具身AI等应用中至关重要，但现有方法难以同时满足低延迟、历史信息保留和多任务处理的需求。

Method: 结合因果时间注意力机制和预训练视觉变换器，提出StreamFormer框架，并通过多任务视觉语言对齐框架进行训练。

Result: 在在线动作检测、视频实例分割和视频问答任务中表现优异，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: StreamFormer为实时视频理解提供了一种高效且多功能的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding continuous video streams plays a fundamental role in real-time
applications including embodied AI and autonomous driving. Unlike offline video
understanding, streaming video understanding requires the ability to process
video streams frame by frame, preserve historical information, and make
low-latency decisions.To address these challenges, our main contributions are
three-fold. (i) We develop a novel streaming video backbone, termed as
StreamFormer, by incorporating causal temporal attention into a pre-trained
vision transformer. This enables efficient streaming video processing while
maintaining image representation capability.(ii) To train StreamFormer, we
propose to unify diverse spatial-temporal video understanding tasks within a
multitask visual-language alignment framework. Hence, StreamFormer learns
global semantics, temporal dynamics, and fine-grained spatial relationships
simultaneously. (iii) We conduct extensive experiments on online action
detection, online video instance segmentation, and video question answering.
StreamFormer achieves competitive results while maintaining efficiency,
demonstrating its potential for real-time applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在补全人像时难以保留独特细节（如服装图案或配饰），且基于参考的修复方法也难以准确捕捉细粒度细节。

Method: 采用双U-Net架构结合RFA块，引导模型关注参考图像中的相关区域，以捕捉细节并确保语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和语义一致性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: CompleteMe显著提升了人像图像补全的细节保留和语义一致性，并提供了新的评估基准。

Abstract: Recent methods for human image completion can reconstruct plausible body
shapes but often fail to preserve unique details, such as specific clothing
patterns or distinctive accessories, without explicit reference images. Even
state-of-the-art reference-based inpainting approaches struggle to accurately
capture and integrate fine-grained details from reference images. To address
this limitation, we propose CompleteMe, a novel reference-based human image
completion framework. CompleteMe employs a dual U-Net architecture combined
with a Region-focused Attention (RFA) Block, which explicitly guides the
model's attention toward relevant regions in reference images. This approach
effectively captures fine details and ensures accurate semantic correspondence,
significantly improving the fidelity and consistency of completed images.
Additionally, we introduce a challenging benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating reference-based human image completion tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior visual quality and
semantic consistency compared to existing techniques. Project page:

TLDR: FlashOverlap提出了一种轻量级设计，通过瓦片级重叠、无干扰计算和通信无关性优化多GPU系统中的通信瓶颈，实验显示性能提升1.65倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多GPU系统中，GPU间通信成为性能瓶颈，尤其是消费级GPU。现有设计无法同时满足瓦片级重叠、无干扰计算和通信无关性的需求。

Method: FlashOverlap采用新型信号机制识别瓦片级数据依赖，不中断计算过程，并通过数据重排实现简单NCCL API调用。

Result: 实验表明，FlashOverlap性能提升高达1.65倍，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlashOverlap通过轻量级设计有效解决了多GPU通信瓶颈，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Generative models have achieved remarkable success across various
applications, driving the demand for multi-GPU computing. Inter-GPU
communication becomes a bottleneck in multi-GPU computing systems, particularly
on consumer-grade GPUs. By exploiting concurrent hardware execution,
overlapping computation and communication latency is an effective technique for
mitigating the communication overhead. We identify that an efficient and
adaptable overlapping design should satisfy (1) tile-wise overlapping to
maximize the overlapping opportunity, (2) interference-free computation to
maintain the original computational performance, and (3) communication
agnosticism to reduce the development burden against varying communication
primitives. Nevertheless, current designs fail to simultaneously optimize for
all of those features.
  To address the issue, we propose FlashOverlap, a lightweight design
characterized by tile-wise overlapping, interference-free computation, and
communication agnosticism. FlashOverlap utilizes a novel signaling mechanism to
identify tile-wise data dependency without interrupting the computation
process, and reorders data to contiguous addresses, enabling communication by
simply calling NCCL APIs. Experiments show that such a lightweight design
achieves up to 1.65x speedup, outperforming existing works in most cases.

Method: 通过将高质量实验室数据转化为训练数据，采用改进的SegFormer架构进行深度学习，用于同步辐射数据的二值分割。

Result: 方法在未见数据上表现出高分割性能，处理时间从小时级缩短至秒级，且在实验过程中形态变化显著时仍保持稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法可广泛应用于不同材料系统，加速跨学科时间分辨断层数据的分析。

Abstract: In situ synchrotron X-ray computed tomography enables dynamic material
studies, but automated segmentation remains challenging due to complex imaging
artefacts and limited training data. We present a methodology for deep
learning-based segmentation by transforming high-quality ex situ laboratory
data to train models for binary segmentation of in situ synchrotron data,
demonstrated through copper oxide dissolution studies. Using a modified
SegFormer architecture, our approach achieves high segmentation performance on
unseen data while reducing processing time from hours to seconds per 3D
dataset. The method maintains consistent performance over significant
morphological changes during experiments, despite training only on static
specimens. This methodology can be readily applied to diverse materials
systems, accelerating the analysis of time-resolved tomographic data across
scientific disciplines.

Motivation: 用户常通过间接、模糊或不明确的查询（如“最佳越野跑鞋”）寻找产品，标准检索和排名系统难以处理此类隐式最高级查询。

Method: 提出SUPERB标注框架，结合LLM生成产品标注，并评估多种现有检索和排名方法。

Result: 实证评估了不同方法在新数据集上的表现，探讨了其在实际电商系统中的应用。

Conclusion: LLM能有效处理隐式最高级查询，SUPERB框架为改进产品推荐提供了新思路。

Abstract: In Recommender Systems, users often seek the best products through indirect,
vague, or under-specified queries, such as "best shoes for trail running". Such
queries, also referred to as implicit superlative queries, pose a significant
challenge for standard retrieval and ranking systems as they lack an explicit
mention of attributes and require identifying and reasoning over complex
factors. We investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate implicit
attributes for ranking as well as reason over them to improve product
recommendations for such queries. As a first step, we propose a novel
four-point schema for annotating the best product candidates for superlative
queries called SUPERB, paired with LLM-based product annotations. We then
empirically evaluate several existing retrieval and ranking approaches on our
new dataset, providing insights and discussing their integration into
real-world e-commerce production systems.

TLDR: 论文分析了检索增强生成（RAG）中两种先进技术——延迟分块和上下文检索的优缺点，发现上下文检索能更好地保持语义连贯性但计算成本高，而延迟分块效率更高但牺牲了相关性和完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中如何有效管理大量外部知识并避免上下文碎片化的问题。

Method: 对延迟分块和上下文检索进行严格分析，评估其在优化RAG系统中的效果和效率。

Result: 上下文检索在保持语义连贯性上更有效但计算资源需求高；延迟分块效率更高但相关性和完整性较差。

Conclusion: 两种技术各有优劣，需根据具体需求权衡选择。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a transformative approach for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external
knowledge sources. Yet, a critical question persists: how can vast volumes of
external knowledge be managed effectively within the input constraints of LLMs?
Traditional methods address this by chunking external documents into smaller,
fixed-size segments. While this approach alleviates input limitations, it often
fragments context, resulting in incomplete retrieval and diminished coherence
in generation. To overcome these shortcomings, two advanced techniques, late
chunking and contextual retrieval, have been introduced, both aiming to
preserve global context. Despite their potential, their comparative strengths
and limitations remain unclear. This study presents a rigorous analysis of late
chunking and contextual retrieval, evaluating their effectiveness and
efficiency in optimizing RAG systems. Our results indicate that contextual
retrieval preserves semantic coherence more effectively but requires greater
computational resources. In contrast, late chunking offers higher efficiency
but tends to sacrifice relevance and completeness.

Motivation: 预训练代码模型依赖高质量注释数据，但人工注释易过时，影响模型性能。LLM生成的高质量注释可能成为替代方案。

Method: 提出两种无参考评估任务（代码-注释不一致检测和语义代码搜索），并用LLM生成注释重建CodeSearchNet数据集，重新预训练CodeT5模型。

Result: LLM生成的注释比人工注释语义更一致，基于此重建的数据集在代码摘要、生成和翻译任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: LLM生成的注释可有效提升预训练数据集质量，挑战了对人工注释的传统依赖，推动了代码智能的发展。

Abstract: Pre-trained code models rely heavily on high-quality pre-training data,
particularly human-written reference comments that bridge code and natural
language. However, these comments often become outdated as software evolves,
degrading model performance. Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating
high-quality code comments. We investigate whether replacing human-written
comments with LLM-generated ones improves pre-training datasets. Since standard
metrics cannot assess reference comment quality, we propose two novel
reference-free evaluation tasks: code-comment inconsistency detection and
semantic code search. Results show that LLM-generated comments are more
semantically consistent with code than human-written ones, as confirmed by
manual evaluation. Leveraging this finding, we rebuild the CodeSearchNet
dataset with LLM-generated comments and re-pre-train CodeT5. Evaluations
demonstrate that models trained on LLM-enhanced data outperform those using
original human comments in code summarization, generation, and translation
tasks. This work validates rebuilding pre-training datasets with LLMs to
advance code intelligence, challenging the traditional reliance on human
reference comments.

Conclusion: EP-Shield能有效检测和净化对抗样本，提升模型防御能力。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of code language models in software engineering tasks
has exposed vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, especially the identifier
substitution attacks. Although existing identifier substitution attackers
demonstrate high success rates, they often produce adversarial examples with
unnatural code patterns. In this paper, we systematically assess the quality of
adversarial examples using LLM-as-a-Judge. Our analysis reveals that over 80%
of adversarial examples generated by state-of-the-art identifier substitution
attackers (e.g., ALERT) are actually detectable. Based on this insight, we
propose EP-Shield, a unified framework for evaluating and purifying identifier
substitution attacks via naturalness-aware reasoning. Specifically, we first
evaluate the naturalness of code and identify the perturbed adversarial code,
then purify it so that the victim model can restore correct prediction.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of EP-Shield over adversarial
fine-tuning (up to 83.36% improvement) and its lightweight design 7B

Abstract: This study investigated visual impairment complaints in a sample of 948
Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) patients using the DiaNAH dataset, emphasizing
advanced machine learning techniques for managing missing data. Patients
completed a CVS questionnaire capturing eight types of visual symptoms,
including blurred vision and altered contrast perception. Due to incomplete
data, 181 patients were excluded, resulting in an analytical subset of 767
individuals. To address the challenge of missing data, an automated machine
learning (AutoML) approach was employed for data imputation, preserving the
distributional characteristics of the original dataset. Patients were grouped
according to singular and combined complaint clusters derived from the 40,320
potential combinations identified through the CVS questionnaire. A linear
correlation analysis revealed minimal to no direct relationship between
patient-reported visual complaints and standard visual perceptual function
tests. This study represents an initial systematic attempt to understand the
complex relationship between subjective visual complaints and objective visual
perceptual assessments in ABI patients. Given the limitations of sample size
and variability, further studies with larger populations are recommended to
robustly explore these complaint clusters and their implications for visual
perception following brain injury.

Abstract: Background: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) planning requires advanced
spatial visualization and consideration of coronary artery depth,
calcification, and pericardial adhesions. Objective: To develop and evaluate a
dynamic cardiovascular holographic visualization tool for preoperative CABG
planning. Methods: Using 4D cardiac computed tomography angiography data from
14 CABG candidates, we developed a semi-automated workflow for time-resolved
segmentation of cardiac structures, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), and
coronary arteries with calcium scoring. The workflow incorporated methods for
cardiac segmentation, coronary calcification quantification, visualization of
coronary depth within EAT, and pericardial adhesion assessment through motion
analysis. Dynamic cardiovascular holograms were displayed using the Looking
Glass platform. Thirteen cardiac surgeons evaluated the tool using a Likert
scale. Additionally, pericardial adhesion scores from holograms of 21 patients
(including seven undergoing secondary cardiac surgeries) were compared with
intraoperative findings. Results: Surgeons rated the visualization tool highly
for preoperative planning utility (mean Likert score: 4.57/5.0). Hologram-based
pericardial adhesion scoring strongly correlated with intraoperative findings
(r=0.786, P<0.001). Conclusion: This study establishes a visualization

(3D-GS), as a powerful and efficient tool, falls short in recovering
transparent objects with nearby contents due to the existence of apparent
secondary ray effects. To address this issue, we propose TransparentGS, a fast
inverse rendering pipeline for transparent objects based on 3D-GS. The main
contributions are three-fold. Firstly, an efficient representation of
transparent objects, transparent Gaussian primitives, is designed to enable
specular refraction through a deferred refraction strategy. Secondly, we
leverage Gaussian light field probes (GaussProbe) to encode both ambient light
and nearby contents in a unified framework. Thirdly, a depth-based iterative
probes query (IterQuery) algorithm is proposed to reduce the parallax errors in
our probe-based framework. Experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of
our approach in recovering transparent objects from complex environments, as
well as several applications in computer graphics and vision.

*Gal Almog,Ariel Shamir,Ohad Fried*

Main category: cs.GR

TLDR: REED-VAE提出了一种新的训练方案，解决了潜在扩散模型在迭代图像编辑中积累噪声和伪影的问题，支持多方法编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型在多次迭代编辑同一图像时，会因像素和潜在空间的反复转换而积累伪影和噪声，限制了灵活性。

Method: 通过REED训练方案优化变分自编码器（VAE），确保多次迭代后仍能保持图像质量。

Result: REED-VAE支持多种迭代编辑操作，包括基于文本和掩码的编辑，提升了编辑成功率和精确性。

Conclusion: REED-VAE为多方法图像编辑任务提供了新基准，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: While latent diffusion models achieve impressive image editing results, their
application to iterative editing of the same image is severely restricted. When
trying to apply consecutive edit operations using current models, they
accumulate artifacts and noise due to repeated transitions between pixel and
latent spaces. Some methods have attempted to address this limitation by
performing the entire edit chain within the latent space, sacrificing
flexibility by supporting only a limited, predetermined set of diffusion
editing operations. We present a RE-encode decode (REED) training scheme for
variational autoencoders (VAEs), which promotes image quality preservation even
after many iterations. Our work enables multi-method iterative image editing:
users can perform a variety of iterative edit operations, with each operation
building on the output of the previous one using both diffusion-based
operations and conventional editing techniques. We demonstrate the advantage of
REED-VAE across a range of image editing scenarios, including text-based and
mask-based editing frameworks. In addition, we show how REED-VAE enhances the
overall editability of images, increasing the likelihood of successful and
precise edit operations. We hope that this work will serve as a benchmark for
the newly introduced task of multi-method image editing. Our code and models
will be available at https://github.com/galmog/REED-VAE

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将顶点、边和面分离处理，缺乏统一性。CLR-Wire旨在通过联合学习几何和拓扑，提升复杂形状和拓扑的建模能力。

Method: 使用注意力驱动的VAE编码曲线和拓扑到连续潜在空间，通过流匹配模型从高斯噪声生成潜在表示，并解码为完整3D线框。

Conclusion: CLR-Wire提供了一种高效且全面的解决方案，统一了几何和拓扑的生成，适用于多种3D建模任务。

Abstract: We introduce CLR-Wire, a novel framework for 3D curve-based wireframe
generation that integrates geometry and topology into a unified Continuous
Latent Representation. Unlike conventional methods that decouple vertices,
edges, and faces, CLR-Wire encodes curves as Neural Parametric Curves along
with their topological connectivity into a continuous and fixed-length latent
space using an attention-driven variational autoencoder (VAE). This unified
approach facilitates joint learning and generation of both geometry and
topology. To generate wireframes, we employ a flow matching model to
progressively map Gaussian noise to these latents, which are subsequently
decoded into complete 3D wireframes. Our method provides fine-grained modeling
of complex shapes and irregular topologies, and supports both unconditional
generation and generation conditioned on point cloud or image inputs.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art
generative approaches, our method achieves substantial improvements in
accuracy, novelty, and diversity, offering an efficient and comprehensive
solution for CAD design, geometric reconstruction, and 3D content creation.

TLDR: 论文提出Sketch2Anim方法，通过条件运动合成将2D故事板草图自动转换为3D动画，解决了传统方法的耗时和复杂性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D动画制作依赖2D草图参考，过程耗时且需要专业技能，亟需自动化方法。

Method: 设计3D条件运动生成器和神经映射器，结合3D关键姿势、关节轨迹和动作词，实现精确运动控制。

Result: 成功将故事板转化为高质量3D动画，支持直接3D编辑，实验和用户研究验证了有效性。

Conclusion: Sketch2Anim为2D到3D动画转换提供了高效解决方案，支持精细控制和编辑。

Abstract: Storyboarding is widely used for creating 3D animations. Animators use the 2D
sketches in storyboards as references to craft the desired 3D animations
through a trial-and-error process. The traditional approach requires
exceptional expertise and is both labor-intensive and time-consuming.
Consequently, there is a high demand for automated methods that can directly
translate 2D storyboard sketches into 3D animations. This task is
under-explored to date and inspired by the significant advancements of motion
diffusion models, we propose to address it from the perspective of conditional
motion synthesis. We thus present Sketch2Anim, composed of two key modules for
sketch constraint understanding and motion generation. Specifically, due to the
large domain gap between the 2D sketch and 3D motion, instead of directly
conditioning on 2D inputs, we design a 3D conditional motion generator that
simultaneously leverages 3D keyposes, joint trajectories, and action words, to
achieve precise and fine-grained motion control. Then, we invent a neural
mapper dedicated to aligning user-provided 2D sketches with their corresponding
3D keyposes and trajectories in a shared embedding space, enabling, for the
first time, direct 2D control of motion generation. Our approach successfully
transfers storyboards into high-quality 3D motions and inherently supports
direct 3D animation editing, thanks to the flexibility of our multi-conditional
motion generator. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations, and a user
perceptual study demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过结合多视角图像特征和3D几何特征，准确分割3D人脸扫描中的皮肤与非皮肤区域，显著提升了注册精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D或3D分割方法在非皮肤区域（如头发、胡须、饰品）表现不佳，导致人脸注册质量下降。需要一种更准确的分割方法。

Method: 利用冻结的图像基础模型提取多视角图像特征，将其与3D扫描网格的几何特征融合，直接在扫描网格上预测分割掩码。

Result: 与纯2D或3D分割方法相比，注册精度分别提高了8.89%和14.3%。模型在合成数据上训练，但对真实数据泛化良好。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态特征融合，显著提升了3D人脸扫描的分割和注册质量，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Face registration deforms a template mesh to closely fit a 3D face scan, the
quality of which commonly degrades in non-skin regions (e.g., hair, beard,
accessories), because the optimized template-to-scan distance pulls the
template mesh towards the noisy scan surface. Improving registration quality
requires a clean separation of skin and non-skin regions on the scan mesh.
Existing image-based (2D) or scan-based (3D) segmentation methods however
perform poorly. Image-based segmentation outputs multi-view inconsistent masks,
and they cannot account for scan inaccuracies or scan-image misalignment, while
scan-based methods suffer from lower spatial resolution compared to images. In
this work, we introduce a novel method that accurately separates skin from
non-skin geometry on 3D human head scans. For this, our method extracts
features from multi-view images using a frozen image foundation model and
aggregates these features in 3D. These lifted 2D features are then fused with
3D geometric features extracted from the scan mesh, to then predict a
segmentation mask directly on the scan mesh. We show that our segmentations
improve the registration accuracy over pure 2D or 3D segmentation methods by
8.89% and 14.3%, respectively. Although trained only on synthetic data, our
model generalizes well to real data.

Conclusion: \alinet为EHT观测提供了一种高效且可靠的图像生成和参数校准方法，有助于更精确地研究黑洞物理。

Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) enables the exploration of black hole
accretion flows at event-horizon scales. Fitting ray-traced physical models to
EHT observations requires the generation of synthetic images, a task that is
computationally demanding. This study leverages \alinet, a generative machine
learning model, to efficiently produce radiatively inefficient accretion flow
(RIAF) images as a function of the specified physical parameters. \alinet has
previously been shown to be able to interpolate black hole images and their
associated physical parameters after training on a computationally tractable
set of library images. We utilize this model to estimate the uncertainty
introduced by a number of anticipated unmodeled physical effects, including
interstellar scattering and intrinsic source variability. We then use this to
calibrate physical parameter estimates and their associated uncertainties from
RIAF model fits to mock EHT data via a library of general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics models.

Result: 生成58K高质量偏好对，实验显示在多个领域平均性能提升显著。

Conclusion: Anyprefer有效解决偏好数据质量问题，提升模型对齐效果。

Abstract: High-quality preference data is essential for aligning foundation models with
human values through preference learning. However, manual annotation of such
data is often time-consuming and costly. Recent methods often adopt a
self-rewarding approach, where the target model generates and annotates its own
preference data, but this can lead to inaccuracies since the reward model
shares weights with the target model, thereby amplifying inherent biases. To
address these issues, we propose Anyprefer, a framework designed to synthesize
high-quality preference data for aligning the target model. Anyprefer frames
the data synthesis process as a cooperative two-player Markov Game, where the
target model and the judge model collaborate together. Here, a series of
external tools are introduced to assist the judge model in accurately rewarding
the target model's responses, mitigating biases in the rewarding process. In
addition, a feedback mechanism is introduced to optimize prompts for both
models, enhancing collaboration and improving data quality. The synthesized
data is compiled into a new preference dataset, Anyprefer-V1, consisting of 58K
high-quality preference pairs. Extensive experiments show that Anyprefer
significantly improves model alignment performance across four main
applications, covering 21 datasets, achieving average improvements of 18.55% in
five natural language generation datasets, 3.66% in nine vision-language
understanding datasets, 30.05% in three medical image analysis datasets, and
16.00% in four visuo-motor control tasks.

Conclusion: LLM的推理能力可通过干预激活表示来调控，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have resulted in
increasingly anthropomorphic language concerning the ability of LLMs to reason.
Whether reasoning in LLMs should be understood to be inherently different is,
however, widely debated. We propose utilizing a representation engineering
approach wherein model activations are read from the residual stream of an LLM
when processing a reasoning task. The activations are used to derive a control
vector that is applied to the model as an inference-time intervention,
modulating the representational space of the model, to improve performance on
the specified task. We publish the code for deriving control vectors and
analyzing model representations. The method allows us to improve performance on
reasoning benchmarks and assess how control vectors influence the final logit
distribution of a model via metrics such as KL divergence and entropy. We apply
control vectors to Mistral-7B-Instruct and a range of Pythia models on an
inductive, a deductive and mathematical reasoning task. We show that an LLM
can, to a certain degree, be controlled to improve its perceived reasoning
ability by modulating activations. The intervention is dependent upon the
ability to reliably extract the model's typical state when correctly solving a
task. Our results suggest that reasoning performance can be modulated in the
same manner as other information-processing tasks performed by LLMs and
demonstrate that we are capable of improving performance on specific tasks via
a simple intervention on the residual stream with no additional training.

Abstract: This paper proposes a parameter collaborative optimization algorithm for
large language models, enhanced with graph spectral analysis. The goal is to
improve both fine-tuning efficiency and structural awareness during training.
In the proposed method, the parameters of a pre-trained language model are
treated as nodes in a graph. A weighted graph is constructed, and Laplacian
spectral decomposition is applied to enable frequency-domain modeling and
structural representation of the parameter space. Based on this structure, a
joint loss function is designed. It combines the task loss with a spectral
regularization term to facilitate collaborative updates among parameters. In
addition, a spectral filtering mechanism is introduced during the optimization
phase. This mechanism adjusts gradients in a structure-aware manner, enhancing
the model's training stability and convergence behavior. The method is
evaluated on multiple tasks, including traditional fine-tuning comparisons,
few-shot generalization tests, and convergence speed analysis. In all settings,
the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance. The experimental
results confirm that the spectral collaborative optimization framework
effectively reduces parameter perturbations and improves fine-tuning quality
while preserving overall model performance. This work contributes significantly
to the field of artificial intelligence by advancing parameter-efficient
training methodologies for large-scale models, reinforcing the importance of
structural signal processing in deep learning optimization, and offering a
robust, generalizable framework for enhancing language model adaptability and
performance.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision transformers have achieved remarkable performance across
various visual tasks but suffer from expensive computational and memory costs.
While model quantization reduces memory usage by lowering precision, these
models still incur significant computational overhead due to the dequantization
before matrix operations. In this work, we analyze the computation graph and
propose an integerization process based on operation reordering. Specifically,
the process delays dequantization until after matrix operations. This enables
integerized matrix multiplication and linear module by directly processing the
quantized input. To validate our approach, we synthesize the self-attention
module of ViT on a systolic array-based hardware. Experimental results show
that our low-bit inference reduces per-PE power consumption for linear layer
and matrix multiplication, bridging the gap between quantized models and
efficient inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Fields have enabled powerful,
discretization-invariant methods for learning neural operators that approximate
solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on general geometries.
Building on these developments, we introduce enf2enf, an encoder--decoder
methodology for predicting steady-state Partial Differential Equations with
non-parameterized geometric variability, based on recently proposed Equivariant
Neural Field architectures. In enf2enf, input geometries are encoded into
latent point cloud embeddings that inherently preserve geometric grounding and
capture local phenomena. The resulting representations are then combined with
global parameters and directly decoded into continuous output fields, thus
efficiently modeling the coupling between geometry and physics. By leveraging
the inductive biases of locality and translation invariance, our approach is
able to capture fine-scale physical features as well as complex shape
variations, thereby enhancing generalization and physical compliance. Extensive
experiments on a high-fidelity aerodynamic dataset, a hyper-elastic material
benchmark, and multi-element airfoil geometries, demonstrate that the proposed
model achieves superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art

Abstract: Making accurate weather predictions can be particularly challenging for
localized storms or events that evolve on hourly timescales, such as
thunderstorms. Hence, our goal for the project was to model Weather Nowcasting
for making highly localized and accurate predictions that apply to the
immediate future replacing the current numerical weather models and data
assimilation systems with Deep Learning approaches. A significant advantage of
machine learning is that inference is computationally cheap given an
already-trained model, allowing forecasts that are nearly instantaneous and in
the native high resolution of the input data. In this work we developed a novel
method that employs Transformer-based machine learning models to forecast
precipitation. This approach works by leveraging axial attention mechanisms to
learn complex patterns and dynamics from time series frames. Moreover, it is a
generic framework and can be applied to univariate and multivariate time series
data, as well as time series embeddings data. This paper represents an initial
research on the dataset used in the domain of next frame prediciton, and hence,
we demonstrate state-of-the-art results in terms of metrices (PSNR = 47.67,

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效学习Brenier势，并在理论和实验中均表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Brenier proved that under certain conditions on a source and a target
probability measure there exists a strictly convex function such that its
gradient is a transport map from the source to the target distribution. This
function is called the Brenier potential. Furthermore, detailed information on
the H\"older regularity of the Brenier potential is available. In this work we
develop the statistical learning theory of generative adversarial neural
networks that learn the Brenier potential. As by the transformation of
densities formula, the density of the generated measure depends on the second
derivative of the Brenier potential, we develop the universal approximation
theory of ReCU networks with cubic activation $\mathtt{ReCU}(x)=\max\{0,x\}^3$
that combines the favorable approximation properties of H\"older functions with
a Lipschitz continuous density. In order to assure the convexity of such
general networks, we introduce an adversarial training procedure for a
potential function represented by the ReCU networks that combines the classical
discriminator cross entropy loss with a penalty term that enforces (strict)
convexity. We give a detailed decomposition of learning errors and show that
for a suitable high penalty parameter all networks chosen in the adversarial
min-max optimization problem are strictly convex. This is further exploited to
prove the consistency of the learning procedure for (slowly) expanding network
capacity. We also implement the described learning algorithm and apply it to a
number of standard test cases from Gaussian mixture to image data as target
distributions. As predicted in theory, we observe that the convexity loss
becomes inactive during the training process and the potentials represented by
the neural networks have learned convexity.

propose Mj\"olnir, a novel deep learning-based framework for global lightning
flash density parameterization. Trained on ERA5 atmospheric predictors and
World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations at a daily temporal
resolution and 1 degree spatial resolution, Mj\"olnir captures the nonlinear
mapping between large-scale environmental conditions and lightning activity.
The model architecture is based on the InceptionNeXt backbone with SENet, and a
multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously predict lightning occurrence and
magnitude. Extensive evaluations yield that Mollnir accurately reproduces the
global distribution, seasonal variability, and regional characteristics of
lightning activity, achieving a global Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96
for annual mean fields. These results suggest that Mj\"olnir serves not only as
an effective data-driven global lightning parameterization but also as a
promising AI-based scheme for next-generation Earth system models (AI-ESMs).

TLDR: 论文提出了一种反事实去偏框架CDMEA，用于解决多模态实体对齐任务中视觉模态可能带来的偏差问题，通过因果分析提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖视觉模态，可能导致模型偏向于简单的图像匹配任务，而忽略了视觉模态不一定总是有益的。

Method: 提出CDMEA框架，从因果视角分析视觉模态偏差，通过估计总效应和排除视觉模态的自然直接效应，利用总间接效应进行预测。

Result: 在9个基准数据集上的实验表明，CDMEA优于14种现有方法，尤其在低相似性、高噪声和低资源数据场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: CDMEA通过因果去偏有效减少了视觉模态的偏差，提升了多模态实体对齐的性能。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Entity Alignment (MMEA) aims to retrieve equivalent entities from
different Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), a critical information
retrieval task. Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and
consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while
overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively.
Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate
unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on
visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality,
leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a
counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates
visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage
both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct
causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the
Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect
(NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the
Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing
visual modality bias. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets show that
CDMEA outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-similarity,
high-noise, and low-resource data scenarios.

Motivation: 合成图像来源归属任务因生成技术复杂、数据集稀缺而具有挑战性，WILD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: WILD数据集包含10个封闭集和10个开放集生成器，各1,000张图像，部分经过后处理。

Result: 数据集支持封闭和开放集识别、验证及抗后处理测试，评估了七种基线方法。

Conclusion: WILD为合成图像来源归属提供了实用工具，模型可受益于其挑战性场景。

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is an open challenge, with an increasing
number of image generators being released yearly. The complexity and the sheer
number of available generative techniques, as well as the scarcity of
high-quality open source datasets of diverse nature for this task, make
training and benchmarking synthetic image source attribution models very
challenging. WILD is a new in-the-Wild Image Linkage Dataset designed to
provide a powerful training and benchmarking tool for synthetic image
attribution models. The dataset is built out of a closed set of 10 popular
commercial generators, which constitutes the training base of attribution
models, and an open set of 10 additional generators, simulating a real-world
in-the-wild scenario. Each generator is represented by 1,000 images, for a
total of 10,000 images in the closed set and 10,000 images in the open set.
Half of the images are post-processed with a wide range of operators. WILD
allows benchmarking attribution models in a wide range of tasks, including
closed and open set identification and verification, and robust attribution
with respect to post-processing and adversarial attacks. Models trained on WILD
are expected to benefit from the challenging scenario represented by the
dataset itself. Moreover, an assessment of seven baseline methodologies on
closed and open set attribution is presented, including robustness tests with
respect to post-processing.

Abstract: The growing burden of myopia and retinal diseases necessitates more
accessible and efficient eye screening solutions. This study presents a
compact, dual-function optical device that integrates fundus photography and
refractive error detection into a unified platform. The system features a
coaxial optical design using dichroic mirrors to separate wavelength-dependent

Motivation: 城市地下异常（如裂缝和空洞）威胁基础设施安全，现有GPR技术因数据标注不足、环境多变和目标边界模糊而难以准确检测。

Method: Res-SAM框架通过视觉提示初步定位异常区域，再分析电磁波变化信息，实现精确提取和分类。

Result: 实验显示Res-SAM准确率>85%，优于现有方法，且仅需少量非目标数据和简单人工交互。

Conclusion: Res-SAM为地下异常检测提供高效、可扩展的解决方案，提升城市安全监测效率，降低成本和人工投入。

Abstract: Urban roads and infrastructure, vital to city operations, face growing
threats from subsurface anomalies like cracks and cavities. Ground Penetrating
Radar (GPR) effectively visualizes underground conditions employing
electromagnetic (EM) waves; however, accurate anomaly detection via GPR remains
challenging due to limited labeled data, varying subsurface conditions, and
indistinct target boundaries. Although visually image-like, GPR data
fundamentally represent EM waves, with variations within and between waves
critical for identifying anomalies. Addressing these, we propose the
Reservoir-enhanced Segment Anything Model (Res-SAM), an innovative framework
exploiting both visual discernibility and wave-changing properties of GPR data.
Res-SAM initially identifies apparent candidate anomaly regions given minimal
prompts, and further refines them by analyzing anomaly-induced changing
information within and between EM waves in local GPR data, enabling precise and
complete anomaly region extraction and category determination. Real-world
experiments demonstrate that Res-SAM achieves high detection accuracy (>85%)
and outperforms state-of-the-art. Notably, Res-SAM requires only minimal
accessible non-target data, avoids intensive training, and incorporates simple
human interaction to enhance reliability. Our research provides a scalable,
resource-efficient solution for rapid subsurface anomaly detection across
diverse environments, improving urban safety monitoring while reducing manual
effort and computational cost.

Motivation: 填补了现有研究在非线性手术和专家分类能力中时间上下文影响的空白。

Method: 通过定制网络平台，让不同经验水平的泌尿科医生对单帧和视频片段进行手术阶段分类，并记录其信心水平和视觉标志。随后在Cholec80和RAPN数据集上训练和测试带/不带时间上下文的AI模型。

Result: 视频片段和视觉标志提升了分类准确性，专家表现优于新手。AI模型表现与专家相当，且时间上下文进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: SPR对专家和AI均具挑战性，时间上下文能显著提升表现。手术工具和器官是关键视觉标志，未来将推动自动SPR发展。

Abstract: Purpose: Automated Surgical Phase Recognition (SPR) uses Artificial
Intelligence (AI) to segment the surgical workflow into its key events,
functioning as a building block for efficient video review, surgical education
as well as skill assessment. Previous research has focused on short and linear
surgical procedures and has not explored if temporal context influences
experts' ability to better classify surgical phases. This research addresses
these gaps, focusing on Robot-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy (RAPN) as a highly
non-linear procedure. Methods: Urologists of varying expertise were grouped and
tasked to indicate the surgical phase for RAPN on both single frames and video
snippets using a custom-made web platform. Participants reported their
confidence levels and the visual landmarks used in their decision-making. AI
architectures without and with temporal context as trained and benchmarked on
the Cholec80 dataset were subsequently trained on this RAPN dataset. Results:
Video snippets and presence of specific visual landmarks improved phase
classification accuracy across all groups. Surgeons displayed high confidence
in their classifications and outperformed novices, who struggled discriminating
phases. The performance of the AI models is comparable to the surgeons in the
survey, with improvements when temporal context was incorporated in both cases.
Conclusion: SPR is an inherently complex task for expert surgeons and computer
vision, where both perform equally well when given the same context.
Performance increases when temporal information is provided. Surgical tools and
organs form the key landmarks for human interpretation and are expected to
shape the future of automated SPR.

Result: 模型在源域和目标域的分类准确率显著提升，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了模型在不同影像数据上的泛化性能。

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common joint disease that causes pain and
mobility issues. While MRI-based deep learning models have demonstrated
superior performance in predicting total knee replacement (TKR) and disease
progression, their generalizability remains challenging, particularly when
applied to imaging data from different sources. In this study, we have shown
that replacing batch normalization with instance normalization, using data
augmentation, and applying contrastive loss improves model generalization in a
baseline deep learning model for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) prediction. We
trained and evaluated our model using MRI data from the Osteoarthritis
Initiative (OAI) database, considering sagittal fat-suppressed
intermediate-weighted turbo spin-echo (FS-IW-TSE) images as the source domain
and sagittal fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3D) dual-echo in steady state
(DESS) images as the target domain. The results demonstrate a statistically
significant improvement in classification accuracy across both domains, with
our approach outperforming the baseline model.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a serious ocular complication of diabetes, is one
of the primary causes of vision loss among retinal vascular diseases. Deep
learning methods have been extensively applied in the grading of diabetic
retinopathy (DR). However, their performance declines significantly when
applied to data outside the training distribution due to domain shifts. Domain
generalization (DG) has emerged as a solution to this challenge. However, most
existing DG methods overlook lesion-specific features, resulting in
insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enhances
existing DG methods by incorporating structural priors, inspired by the
observation that DR grading is heavily dependent on vessel and lesion
structures. We introduce Low-rank Adaptive Structural Priors (LoASP), a
plug-and-play framework designed for seamless integration with existing DG
models. LoASP improves generalization by learning adaptive structural
representations that are finely tuned to the complexities of DR diagnosis.
Extensive experiments on eight diverse datasets validate its effectiveness in
both single-source and multi-source domain scenarios. Furthermore,
visualizations reveal that the learned structural priors intuitively align with
the intricate architecture of the vessels and lesions, providing compelling
insights into their interpretability and diagnostic relevance.

Conclusion: 该框架有望提升基层医院的诊断能力，为临床决策提供高效支持。

Abstract: Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common musculoskeletal disease that
requires magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for effective clinical management.
However, the interpretation of MRI images heavily relies on the expertise of
radiologists, leading to delayed diagnosis and high costs for training
physicians. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative automated LDH
classification framework. To address these key issues, the framework utilizes
T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI images from 205 people. The framework extracts
clinically actionable LDH features and generates standardized diagnostic
outputs by leveraging data augmentation and channel and spatial attention
mechanisms. These outputs can help physicians make confident and time-effective
care decisions when needed. The proposed framework achieves an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.969 and an accuracy of
0.9486 for LDH detection. The experimental results demonstrate the performance
of the proposed framework. Our framework only requires a small number of
datasets for training to demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy. This is expected
to be a solution to enhance the LDH detection capabilities of primary
hospitals.

Conclusion: 加速SMC算法在3D超声心动图配准中表现优异，具有高效和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The perfect alignment of 3D echocardiographic images captured from various
angles has improved image quality and broadened the field of view. This study
proposes an accelerated sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm for 3D-3D rigid
registration of transthoracic echocardiographic images with significant and
limited overlap taken from apical window that is robust to the noise and
intensity variation in ultrasound images. The algorithm estimates the
translational and rotational components of the rigid transform through an
iterative process and requires an initial approximation of the rotation and
translation limits. We perform registration in two ways: the image-based
registration computes the transform to align the end-diastolic frame of the
apical nonstandard image to the apical standard image and applies the same
transform to all frames of the cardiac cycle, whereas the mask-based
registration approach uses the binary masks of the left ventricle in the same
way. The SMC and exhaustive search (EX) algorithms were evaluated for 4D
temporal sequences recorded from 7 volunteers who participated in a study
conducted at the Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute. The evaluations
demonstrate that the mask-based approach of the accelerated SMC yielded a Dice
score value of 0.819 +/- 0.045 for the left ventricle and gained 16.7x speedup
compared to the CPU version of the SMC algorithm.

Conclusion: SST-DUNet能有效替代手动颅骨剥离，适用于大鼠fMRI分析。

Abstract: Skull stripping is a common preprocessing step that is often performed
manually in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) pipelines, including functional
MRI (fMRI). This manual process is time-consuming and operator dependent.
Automating this process is challenging for preclinical data due to variations
in brain geometry, resolution, and tissue contrast. While existing methods for
MRI skull stripping exist, they often struggle with the low resolution and
varying slice sizes in preclinical fMRI data. This study proposes a novel
method called SST-DUNet, that integrates a dense UNet-based architecture with a
feature extractor based on Smart Swin Transformer (SST) for fMRI skull
stripping. The Smart Shifted Window Multi-Head Self-Attention (SSW-MSA) module
in SST is adapted to replace the mask-based module in the Swin Transformer
(ST), enabling the learning of distinct channel-wise features while focusing on
relevant dependencies within brain structures. This modification allows the
model to better handle the complexities of fMRI skull stripping, such as low
resolution and variable slice sizes. To address the issue of class imbalance in
preclinical data, a combined loss function using Focal and Dice loss is
utilized. The model was trained on rat fMRI images and evaluated across three
in-house datasets with a Dice similarity score of 98.65%, 97.86%, and 98.04%.
The fMRI results obtained through automatic skull stripping using the SST-DUNet
model closely align with those from manual skull stripping for both seed-based
and independent component analyses. These results indicate that the SST-DUNet
can effectively substitute manual brain extraction in rat fMRI analysis.

Abstract: This paper explores the strategic use of modern synthetic data generation and

approaches.
  The goal is to create realistic, privacy-preserving datasets that retain high
utility for complex machine learning tasks and analytics, a critical need in
the data-sensitive industries like BFSI, Healthcare, Retail, and
Telecommunications. We discuss how these modern techniques potentially offer
significant improvements in balancing privacy preservation while maintaining
data utility compared to older methods. Furthermore, we examine the potential
for operational gains, such as reduced overhead and accelerated analytics, by
using these privacy-enhanced datasets. We also explore key use cases where
these methods can mitigate regulatory risks and enable scalable, data-driven
innovation without compromising sensitive customer information.

Method: 提出Spatial Attention Unlearning (SAU)，利用潜在空间操作和空间注意力机制隔离并移除后门触发的潜在表示。

Result: SAU在多种后门攻击中实现100%触发移除准确率，CLIP分数0.7023，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAU是保护文本到图像扩散模型免受后门攻击的鲁棒、可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are increasingly vulnerable to backdoor
attacks, where malicious modifications to the training data cause the model to
generate unintended outputs when specific triggers are present. While
classification models have seen extensive development of defense mechanisms,
generative models remain largely unprotected due to their high-dimensional
output space, which complicates the detection and mitigation of subtle
perturbations. Defense strategies for diffusion models, in particular, remain
under-explored. In this work, we propose Spatial Attention Unlearning (SAU), a
novel technique for mitigating backdoor attacks in diffusion models. SAU
leverages latent space manipulation and spatial attention mechanisms to isolate
and remove the latent representation of backdoor triggers, ensuring precise and
efficient removal of malicious effects. We evaluate SAU across various types of
backdoor attacks, including pixel-based and style-based triggers, and
demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving 100% trigger removal accuracy.
Furthermore, SAU achieves a CLIP score of 0.7023, outperforming existing
methods while preserving the model's ability to generate high-quality,
semantically aligned images. Our results show that SAU is a robust, scalable,
and practical solution for securing text-to-image diffusion models against
backdoor attacks.

<details>

Motivation: 探索LLM在提供医疗建议方面的实际应用效果，特别是在与公众互动时的表现。

Method: 在1,298名参与者中开展对照实验，比较LLM（GPT-4o、Llama 3、Command R+）与对照组在10个医疗场景中的表现。

Result: LLM单独测试时表现优异（病情识别准确率94.9%，治疗方案选择56.3%），但与用户交互时效果显著下降（病情识别<34.5%，治疗方案选择<44.2%），与对照组无显著差异。

Conclusion: LLM在医疗建议中的实际应用需重视用户交互问题，建议在公开部署前进行系统性用户测试。

Abstract: Global healthcare providers are exploring use of large language models (LLMs)
to provide medical advice to the public. LLMs now achieve nearly perfect scores
on medical licensing exams, but this does not necessarily translate to accurate
performance in real-world settings. We tested if LLMs can assist members of the
public in identifying underlying conditions and choosing a course of action
(disposition) in ten medical scenarios in a controlled study with 1,298
participants. Participants were randomly assigned to receive assistance from an
LLM (GPT-4o, Llama 3, Command R+) or a source of their choice (control). Tested
alone, LLMs complete the scenarios accurately, correctly identifying conditions
in 94.9% of cases and disposition in 56.3% on average. However, participants
using the same LLMs identified relevant conditions in less than 34.5% of cases
and disposition in less than 44.2%, both no better than the control group. We
identify user interactions as a challenge to the deployment of LLMs for medical
advice. Standard benchmarks for medical knowledge and simulated patient
interactions do not predict the failures we find with human participants.
Moving forward, we recommend systematic human user testing to evaluate
interactive capabilities prior to public deployments in healthcare.

TLDR: LINC系统帮助多语言团队克服英语交流障碍，提升会议参与和讨论理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言团队中ESL研究者在英语会议中的交流困难。

Method: 调查64名ESL研究者，设计并开发LINC系统，进行两阶段研究评估。

Result: LINC帮助参与者用偏好语言交流，提升会议准备和回顾效果。

Conclusion: LINC在多语言协作中有效，但需考虑语言偏好外的其他因素。

Abstract: Collaborative research often includes contributors with varied perspectives
from diverse linguistic backgrounds. However, English as a Second Language
(ESL) researchers often struggle to communicate during meetings in English and
comprehend discussions, leading to limited contribution. To investigate these
challenges, we surveyed 64 ESL researchers who frequently collaborate in
multilingual teams and identified four key design goals around participation,
comprehension, documentation, and feedback. Guided by these design goals, we
developed LINC, a multimodal Language INdependent Collaboration system with two
components: a real-time module for multilingual communication during meetings
and a post-meeting dashboard for discussion analysis. We evaluated the system
through a two-phased study with six triads of multilingual teams. We found that
using LINC, participants benefited from communicating in their preferred
language, recalled and reviewed actionable insights, and prepared for upcoming
meetings effectively. We discuss external factors that impact multilingual
meeting participation beyond language preferences and the implications of
multimodal systems in facilitating meetings in hybrid multilingual
collaborative settings beyond research.

Result: 实验表明，VersBand在客观和主观指标上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VersBand通过多任务框架实现了高质量、可控的歌曲生成，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Song generation focuses on producing controllable high-quality songs based on
various prompts. However, existing methods struggle to generate vocals and
accompaniments with prompt-based control and proper alignment. Additionally,
they fall short in supporting various tasks. To address these challenges, we
introduce VersBand, a multi-task song generation framework for synthesizing
high-quality, aligned songs with prompt-based control. VersBand comprises these
primary models: 1) VocalBand, a decoupled model, leverages the flow-matching
method for generating singing styles, pitches, and mel-spectrograms, allowing
fast, high-quality vocal generation with style control. 2) AccompBand, a
flow-based transformer model, incorporates the Band-MOE, selecting suitable
experts for enhanced quality, alignment, and control. This model allows for
generating controllable, high-quality accompaniments aligned with vocals. 3)
Two generation models, LyricBand for lyrics and MelodyBand for melodies,
contribute to the comprehensive multi-task song generation system, allowing for
extensive control based on multiple prompts. Experimental results demonstrate
that VersBand performs better over baseline models across multiple song
generation tasks using objective and subjective metrics. Audio samples are
available at https://VersBand.github.io.

Result: 构建了包含10.7k物体和9.5M抓取的数据集，覆盖31种抓取类型。生成模型在真实实验中成功率达82.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了抓取合成的通用性和质量，为机器人抓取技能的发展提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Generalizable dexterous grasping with suitable grasp types is a fundamental
skill for intelligent robots. Developing such skills requires a large-scale and
high-quality dataset that covers numerous grasp types (i.e., at least those
categorized by the GRASP taxonomy), but collecting such data is extremely
challenging. Existing automatic grasp synthesis methods are often limited to
specific grasp types or object categories, hindering scalability. This work
proposes an efficient pipeline capable of synthesizing contact-rich,
penetration-free, and physically plausible grasps for any grasp type, object,
and articulated hand. Starting from a single human-annotated template for each
hand and grasp type, our pipeline tackles the complicated synthesis problem
with two stages: optimize the object to fit the hand template first, and then
locally refine the hand to fit the object in simulation. To validate the
synthesized grasps, we introduce a contact-aware control strategy that allows
the hand to apply the appropriate force at each contact point to the object.
Those validated grasps can also be used as new grasp templates to facilitate
future synthesis. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms
previous type-unaware grasp synthesis baselines in simulation. Using our
algorithm, we construct a dataset containing 10.7k objects and 9.5M grasps,
covering 31 grasp types in the GRASP taxonomy. Finally, we train a
type-conditional generative model that successfully performs the desired grasp
type from single-view object point clouds, achieving an 82.3% success rate in
real-world experiments. Project page: https://pku-epic.github.io/Dexonomy.

TLDR: 论文提出了首个定量评估框架，用于比较两种脑启发视觉传感器（BVS）在变速度机器人感知中的表现，发现EVS在高速稀疏场景表现良好，而Tianmouc在多种场景下表现一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相机在高速动态条件下存在运动模糊问题，影响空间特征完整性和任务性能，因此需要评估脑启发视觉传感器的替代方案。

Method: 建立统一测试协议，包括跨传感器校准、标准化测试平台和质量指标，评估EVS和Tianmouc在成像和功能任务（如角点检测和运动估计）中的表现。

Result: EVS在高速稀疏场景表现良好，但在高速复杂场景中受限；Tianmouc在多种速度和场景下表现一致。

Conclusion: 研究为BVS技术的应用选择提供了依据，并支持该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Perception systems in robotics encounter significant challenges in high-speed
and dynamic conditions when relying on traditional cameras, where motion blur
can compromise spatial feature integrity and task performance. Brain-inspired
vision sensors (BVS) have recently gained attention as an alternative, offering
high temporal resolution with reduced bandwidth and power requirements. Here,
we present the first quantitative evaluation framework for two representative
classes of BVSs in variable-speed robotic sensing, including event-based vision
sensors (EVS) that detect asynchronous temporal contrasts, and the
primitive-based sensor Tianmouc that employs a complementary mechanism to
encode both spatiotemporal changes and intensity. A unified testing protocol is
established, including crosssensor calibrations, standardized testing
platforms, and quality metrics to address differences in data modality. From an
imaging standpoint, we evaluate the effects of sensor non-idealities, such as
motion-induced distortion, on the capture of structural information. For
functional benchmarking, we examine task performance in corner detection and
motion estimation under different rotational speeds. Results indicate that EVS
performs well in highspeed, sparse scenarios and in modestly fast, complex
scenes, but exhibits performance limitations in high-speed, cluttered settings
due to pixel-level bandwidth variations and event rate saturation. In
comparison, Tianmouc demonstrates consistent performance across sparse and
complex scenarios at various speeds, supported by its global, precise,
high-speed spatiotemporal gradient samplings. These findings offer valuable
insights into the applicationdependent suitability of BVS technologies and
support further advancement in this area.

TLDR: NORA是一个3B参数的视觉-语言-动作模型，旨在减少计算开销，同时保持任务性能，适用于实时机器人环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在零样本场景中表现良好，但视觉编码限制和高计算开销使其不适用于实时机器人环境。

Method: NORA基于Qwen-2.5-VL-3B多模态模型，结合970k真实机器人演示数据和FAST+分词器，优化视觉推理和动作生成。

Result: NORA在任务性能上优于现有大型VLA模型，同时显著降低计算开销。

Conclusion: NORA为实时机器人自主性提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promising performance
in zero-shot scenarios, demonstrating impressive task execution and reasoning
capabilities. However, a significant challenge arises from the limitations of
visual encoding, which can result in failures during tasks such as object
grasping. Moreover, these models typically suffer from high computational
overhead due to their large sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. While these
models excel in reasoning and task planning, the substantial computational
overhead they incur makes them impractical for real-time robotic environments,
where speed and efficiency are paramount. To address the limitations of
existing VLA models, we propose NORA, a 3B-parameter model designed to reduce
computational overhead while maintaining strong task performance. NORA adopts
the Qwen-2.5-VL-3B multimodal model as its backbone, leveraging its superior
visual-semantic understanding to enhance visual reasoning and action grounding.
Additionally, our \model{} is trained on 970k real-world robot demonstrations
and equipped with the FAST+ tokenizer for efficient action sequence generation.
Experimental results demonstrate that NORA outperforms existing large-scale VLA
models, achieving better task performance with significantly reduced
computational overhead, making it a more practical solution for real-time
robotic autonomy.
