### [1] [A Data Synthesis Method Driven by Large Language Models for Proactive Mining of Implicit User Intentions in Tourism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11533)
*Jinqiang Wang,Huansheng Ning,Tao Zhu,Jianguo Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出SynPT方法，利用LLM驱动的用户和助手代理生成高质量旅游领域对话数据集，解决现有方法在隐式意图挖掘和主动引导上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游领域LLM难以挖掘用户隐式意图且缺乏主动引导能力，现有数据合成方法存在领域适应性差、数据分布不均等问题。

Method: 构建LLM驱动的用户和助手代理，基于中文旅游网站种子数据模拟对话，生成包含显式推理的训练数据集SynPT-Dialog。

Result: 实验证明SynPT优于现有方法，能有效挖掘隐式意图，并分析了关键超参数和英语场景适应性。

Conclusion: SynPT通过高质量数据合成和显式推理，显著提升了旅游领域LLM的隐式意图挖掘能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In the tourism domain, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to mine
implicit user intentions from tourists' ambiguous inquiries and lack the
capacity to proactively guide users toward clarifying their needs. A critical
bottleneck is the scarcity of high-quality training datasets that facilitate
proactive questioning and implicit intention mining. While recent advances
leverage LLM-driven data synthesis to generate such datasets and transfer
specialized knowledge to downstream models, existing approaches suffer from
several shortcomings: (1) lack of adaptation to the tourism domain, (2) skewed
distributions of detail levels in initial inquiries, (3) contextual redundancy
in the implicit intention mining module, and (4) lack of explicit thinking
about tourists' emotions and intention values. Therefore, we propose SynPT (A
Data Synthesis Method Driven by LLMs for Proactive Mining of Implicit User
Intentions in the Tourism), which constructs an LLM-driven user agent and
assistant agent to simulate dialogues based on seed data collected from Chinese
tourism websites. This approach addresses the aforementioned limitations and
generates SynPT-Dialog, a training dataset containing explicit reasoning. The
dataset is utilized to fine-tune a general LLM, enabling it to proactively mine
implicit user intentions. Experimental evaluations, conducted from both human
and LLM perspectives, demonstrate the superiority of SynPT compared to existing
methods. Furthermore, we analyze key hyperparameters and present case studies
to illustrate the practical applicability of our method, including discussions
on its adaptability to English-language scenarios. All code and data are
publicly available.

### [2] [AI-generated Text Detection: A Multifaceted Approach to Binary and Multiclass Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11550)
*Harika Abburi,Sanmitra Bhattacharya,Edward Bowen,Nirmala Pudota*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了检测AI生成文本的重要性，并提出了两种神经网络架构，分别用于区分人类与AI生成文本（Task A）和识别生成模型（Task B），在AAAI 2025的共享任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的文本生成能力可能被滥用（如假新闻、垃圾邮件等），因此需要准确检测AI生成文本及其来源模型，以确保LLMs的负责任使用。

Method: 针对Task A（区分人类与AI生成文本）和Task B（识别生成模型），分别提出了优化的神经网络架构和简化版本。

Result: Task A的优化模型F1得分为0.994（排名第五），Task B的简化模型F1得分为0.627（排名第五）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在检测AI生成文本及其来源模型方面表现良好，为LLMs的负责任使用提供了技术支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating text that closely resembles human writing across a wide range of
styles and genres. However, such capabilities are prone to potential misuse,
such as fake news generation, spam email creation, and misuse in academic
assignments. As a result, accurate detection of AI-generated text and
identification of the model that generated it are crucial for maintaining the
responsible use of LLMs. In this work, we addressed two sub-tasks put forward
by the Defactify workshop under AI-Generated Text Detection shared task at the
Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025): Task A
involved distinguishing between human-authored or AI-generated text, while Task
B focused on attributing text to its originating language model. For each task,
we proposed two neural architectures: an optimized model and a simpler variant.
For Task A, the optimized neural architecture achieved fifth place with $F1$
score of 0.994, and for Task B, the simpler neural architecture also ranked
fifth place with $F1$ score of 0.627.

### [3] [Assessing Collective Reasoning in Multi-Agent LLMs via Hidden Profile Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11556)
*Yuxuan Li,Aoi Naito,Hirokazu Shirado*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文引入社会心理学中的Hidden Profile范式，用于评估多智能体LLM系统的集体推理失败，发现其表现与人类群体相似但存在细微差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏理论基础的基准来系统评估多智能体LLM系统的集体推理失败，因此引入Hidden Profile范式填补这一空白。

Method: 将Hidden Profile范式形式化为多智能体决策任务，构建包含九种场景的基准，并在GPT-4.1等LLM上进行实验。

Result: 多智能体系统在所有模型中均未能达到单智能体完整信息的准确性，表现与人类群体类似但对社会期望更敏感。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个可复现的评估框架，揭示了合作与矛盾在多智能体系统中的权衡，为未来人工集体智能研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving through distributed information integration, but also risk
replicating collective reasoning failures observed in human groups. Yet, no
theory-grounded benchmark exists to systematically evaluate such failures. In
this paper, we introduce the Hidden Profile paradigm from social psychology as
a diagnostic testbed for multi-agent LLM systems. By distributing critical
information asymmetrically across agents, the paradigm reveals how inter-agent
dynamics support or hinder collective reasoning. We first formalize the
paradigm for multi-agent decision-making under distributed knowledge and
instantiate it as a benchmark with nine tasks spanning diverse scenarios,
including adaptations from prior human studies. We then conduct experiments
with GPT-4.1 and five other leading LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced
variants, showing that multi-agent systems across all models fail to match the
accuracy of single agents given complete information. While agents' collective
performance is broadly comparable to that of human groups, nuanced behavioral
differences emerge, such as increased sensitivity to social desirability.
Finally, we demonstrate the paradigm's diagnostic utility by exploring a
cooperation-contradiction trade-off in multi-agent LLM systems. We find that
while cooperative agents are prone to over-coordination in collective settings,
increased contradiction impairs group convergence. This work contributes a
reproducible framework for evaluating multi-agent LLM systems and motivates
future research on artificial collective intelligence and human-AI interaction.

### [4] [Talk to Your Slides: Efficient Slide Editing Agent with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11604)
*Kyudan Jung,Hojun Cho,Jooyeol Yun,Jaehyeok Jang,Jagul Choo*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Talk-to-Your-Slides的LLM驱动工具，通过COM通信直接在PowerPoint中编辑幻灯片，解决了现有研究忽视的幻灯片编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注幻灯片生成，而忽略了编辑现有幻灯片的繁琐任务。

Method: 采用两级方法：高层处理由LLM代理解析指令并制定编辑计划，低层执行由Python脚本直接操作PowerPoint对象。

Result: 实验表明，Talk-to-Your-Slides在执行成功率、指令忠实度和编辑效率上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该工具为幻灯片编辑提供了更灵活和上下文感知的解决方案，并发布了TSBench数据集用于评估。

Abstract: Existing research on large language models (LLMs) for PowerPoint
predominantly focuses on slide generation, overlooking the common yet tedious
task of editing existing slides. We introduce Talk-to-Your-Slides, an
LLM-powered agent that directly edits slides within active PowerPoint sessions
through COM communication. Our system employs a two-level approach: (1)
high-level processing where an LLM agent interprets instructions and formulates
editing plans, and (2) low-level execution where Python scripts directly
manipulate PowerPoint objects. Unlike previous methods relying on predefined
operations, our approach enables more flexible and contextually-aware editing.
To facilitate evaluation, we present TSBench, a human-annotated dataset of 379
diverse editing instructions with corresponding slide variations. Experimental
results demonstrate that Talk-to-Your-Slides significantly outperforms baseline
methods in execution success rate, instruction fidelity, and editing
efficiency. Our code and benchmark are available at

### [5] [MedGUIDE: Benchmarking Clinical Decision-Making in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11613)
*Xiaomin Li,Mingye Gao,Yuexing Hao,Taoran Li,Guangya Wan,Zihan Wang,Yijun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: MedGUIDE是一个评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在遵循临床指南决策树能力的新基准，发现即使专业模型也表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs是否能可靠遵循结构化临床指南，确保其在医疗决策中的安全性和准确性。

Method: 基于55个NCCN决策树构建MedGUIDE，生成临床场景并筛选高质量样本，评估25种LLMs的表现。

Result: 发现即使专业LLMs在结构化指南任务中表现不佳，尝试通过上下文指南或继续预训练改进效果有限。

Conclusion: MedGUIDE对评估LLMs在真实临床环境中的安全操作至关重要。

Abstract: Clinical guidelines, typically structured as decision trees, are central to
evidence-based medical practice and critical for ensuring safe and accurate
diagnostic decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether Large Language
Models (LLMs) can reliably follow such structured protocols. In this work, we
introduce MedGUIDE, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on their ability to
make guideline-consistent clinical decisions. MedGUIDE is constructed from 55
curated NCCN decision trees across 17 cancer types and uses clinical scenarios
generated by LLMs to create a large pool of multiple-choice diagnostic
questions. We apply a two-stage quality selection process, combining
expert-labeled reward models and LLM-as-a-judge ensembles across ten clinical
and linguistic criteria, to select 7,747 high-quality samples. We evaluate 25
LLMs spanning general-purpose, open-source, and medically specialized models,
and find that even domain-specific LLMs often underperform on tasks requiring
structured guideline adherence. We also test whether performance can be
improved via in-context guideline inclusion or continued pretraining. Our
findings underscore the importance of MedGUIDE in assessing whether LLMs can
operate safely within the procedural frameworks expected in real-world clinical
settings.

### [6] [Steering Risk Preferences in Large Language Models by Aligning Behavioral and Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11615)
*Jian-Qiao Zhu,Haijiang Yan,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 通过编辑Transformer的残差流，使用“转向向量”可以高效地改变大型语言模型（LLM）的行为，无需重新训练或微调。本文提出了一种系统识别转向向量的方法，通过行为方法（如MCMC）与神经表征对齐，成功提取并应用了风险偏好的转向向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在不重新训练或微调的情况下，通过修改内部神经激活（转向向量）来高效地改变LLM的行为。

Method: 提出了一种系统识别转向向量的方法，通过行为方法（如MCMC）与神经表征对齐，提取风险偏好的转向向量。

Result: 生成的转向向量能够可靠地调整LLM的输出，使其符合目标行为。

Conclusion: 通过表征工程和转向向量，可以高效且有针对性地影响LLM的行为，为模型行为控制提供了新方法。

Abstract: Changing the behavior of large language models (LLMs) can be as
straightforward as editing the Transformer's residual streams using
appropriately constructed "steering vectors." These modifications to internal
neural activations, a form of representation engineering, offer an effective
and targeted means of influencing model behavior without retraining or
fine-tuning the model. But how can such steering vectors be systematically
identified? We propose a principled approach for uncovering steering vectors by
aligning latent representations elicited through behavioral methods
(specifically, Markov chain Monte Carlo with LLMs) with their neural
counterparts. To evaluate this approach, we focus on extracting latent risk
preferences from LLMs and steering their risk-related outputs using the aligned
representations as steering vectors. We show that the resulting steering
vectors successfully and reliably modulate LLM outputs in line with the
targeted behavior.

Applications), a reference free framework for RAG (Retrieval Augmented
generation) based question answering (QA) applications. THELMA consist of six
interdependent metrics specifically designed for holistic, fine grained
evaluation of RAG QA applications. THELMA framework helps developers and
application owners evaluate, monitor and improve end to end RAG QA pipelines
without requiring labelled sources or reference responses.We also present our
findings on the interplay of the proposed THELMA metrics, which can be
interpreted to identify the specific RAG component needing improvement in QA
applications.

### [8] [Critique-Guided Distillation: Improving Supervised Fine-tuning via Better Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11628)
*Berkcan Kapusuzoglu,Supriyo Chakraborty,Chia-Hsuan Lee,Sambit Sahu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种名为CGD的多阶段框架，通过整合教师模型的解释性评论和精炼响应，解决SFT中的模仿问题，显著提升任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT方法存在模仿问题，模型仅复制响应而不理解其原理。

Method: CGD框架利用教师模型的评论和精炼响应，训练学生模型学习响应及其背后的原因。

Result: 在数学和语言理解任务上分别提升17.5%和6.3%，并缓解了格式漂移问题。

Conclusion: CGD通过结合评论和响应，有效解决了模仿问题并提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using expert demonstrations often suffer from
the imitation problem, where the model learns to reproduce the correct
responses without \emph{understanding} the underlying rationale. To address
this limitation, we propose \textsc{Critique-Guided Distillation (CGD)}, a
novel multi-stage framework that integrates teacher model generated
\emph{explanatory critiques} and \emph{refined responses} into the SFT process.
A student model is then trained to map the triplet of prompt, teacher critique,
and its own initial response to the corresponding refined teacher response,
thereby learning both \emph{what} to imitate and \emph{why}. Using
entropy-based analysis, we show that \textsc{CGD} reduces refinement
uncertainty and can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior update. We perform
extensive empirical evaluation of \textsc{CGD}, on variety of benchmark tasks,
and demonstrate significant gains on both math (AMC23 +17.5%) and language
understanding tasks (MMLU-Pro +6.3%), while successfully mitigating the format
drift issues observed in previous critique fine-tuning (CFT) techniques.

### [9] [Can an Easy-to-Hard Curriculum Make Reasoning Emerge in Small Language Models? Evidence from a Four-Stage Curriculum on GPT-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11643)
*Xiang Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 通过分阶段课程训练小语言模型（SLMs）显著提高推理透明度和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过有序的课程设计提升小语言模型的推理能力和训练效率。

Method: 训练124M参数的GPT-2模型Cognivolve，采用四阶段课程（从词汇匹配到多步符号推理），无需任务特定微调。

Result: Cognivolve在优化步骤减半的情况下达到目标精度，激活更多梯度显著推理头，注意力熵更高。

Conclusion: 有序课程设计是提升模型性能的关键，但仍存在最终答案成功率低等挑战。

Abstract: We demonstrate that a developmentally ordered curriculum markedly improves
reasoning transparency and sample-efficiency in small language models (SLMs).
Concretely, we train Cognivolve, a 124 M-parameter GPT-2 model, on a four-stage
syllabus that ascends from lexical matching to multi-step symbolic inference
and then evaluate it without any task-specific fine-tuning. Cognivolve reaches
target accuracy in half the optimization steps of a single-phase baseline,
activates an order-of-magnitude more gradient-salient reasoning heads, and
shifts those heads toward deeper layers, yielding higher-entropy attention that
balances local and long-range context. The same curriculum applied out of order
or with optimizer resets fails to reproduce these gains, confirming that
progression--not extra compute--drives the effect. We also identify open
challenges: final-answer success still lags a conventional run by about 30%,
and our saliency probe under-detects verbal-knowledge heads in the hardest
stage, suggesting directions for mixed-stage fine-tuning and probe expansion.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, ensuring
their effectiveness across multiple languages presents unique challenges.
Multilingual prompt engineering has emerged as a key approach to enhance LLMs'
capabilities in diverse linguistic settings without requiring extensive
parameter re-training or fine-tuning. With growing interest in multilingual
prompt engineering over the past two to three years, researchers have explored
various strategies to improve LLMs' performance across languages and NLP tasks.
By crafting structured natural language prompts, researchers have successfully
extracted knowledge from LLMs across different languages, making these
techniques an accessible pathway for a broader audience, including those
without deep expertise in machine learning, to harness the capabilities of
LLMs. In this paper, we survey and categorize different multilingual prompting
techniques based on the NLP tasks they address across a diverse set of datasets
that collectively span around 250 languages. We further highlight the LLMs
employed, present a taxonomy of approaches and discuss potential
state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods for specific multilingual datasets.
Additionally, we derive a range of insights across language families and
resource levels (high-resource vs. low-resource), including analyses such as
the distribution of NLP tasks by language resource type and the frequency of
prompting methods across different language families. Our survey reviews 36
research papers covering 39 prompting techniques applied to 30 multilingual NLP
tasks, with the majority of these studies published in the last two years.

*Zhibo Hu,Chen Wang,Yanfeng Shu,Hye-Young Paik,Liming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过分析潜在空间中模糊文本的表示差异来识别歧义，并设计了一种新的距离测量方法，改进了LLM在模糊任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言中的歧义是LLM在文本到结构化数据映射中的主要障碍，现有方法未能有效解决这一问题。

Method: 通过稀疏自编码器（SAE）的梯度路径核计算概念缺失的距离测量，识别歧义模式。

Result: 提出了一种新框架，通过预测缺失概念来提升LLM在模糊任务（如代理工具调用）中的性能。

Conclusion: 新方法通过潜在空间分析有效识别歧义，显著提升了LLM在模糊任务中的表现。

Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving
accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs),
which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool
calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods of ambiguity handling either
exploit ReACT framework to produce the correct mapping through trial and error,
or supervised fine tuning to guide models to produce a biased mapping to
improve certain tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that
characterizes the representation difference of ambiguous text in the latent
space and leverage the difference to identify ambiguity before mapping them to
structured data. To detect ambiguity of a sentence, we focused on the
relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations and what
cause the LLM ignore multiple interpretations. Different to the distance
calculated by dense embedding vectors, we utilize the observation that
ambiguity is caused by concept missing in latent space of LLM to design a new
distance measurement, computed through the path kernel by the integral of
gradient values for each concepts from sparse-autoencoder (SAE) under each
state. We identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous questions with this
measurement. Based on our observation, We propose a new framework to improve
the performance of LLMs on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing
concepts prediction.

Conclusion: 论文通过优化双编码器设计，提出了高效的实体消歧方法，为相关任务提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Entity disambiguation (ED) is the task of linking mentions in text to
corresponding entries in a knowledge base. Dual Encoders address this by
embedding mentions and label candidates in a shared embedding space and
applying a similarity metric to predict the correct label. In this work, we
focus on evaluating key design decisions for Dual Encoder-based ED, such as its
loss function, similarity metric, label verbalization format, and negative
sampling strategy. We present the resulting model VerbalizED, a document-level
Dual Encoder model that includes contextual label verbalizations and efficient
hard negative sampling. Additionally, we explore an iterative prediction
variant that aims to improve the disambiguation of challenging data points.
Comprehensive experiments on AIDA-Yago validate the effectiveness of our
approach, offering insights into impactful design choices that result in a new
State-of-the-Art system on the ZELDA benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲低资源语言在ASR研究中代表性不足，面临数据稀缺、语言复杂性等挑战，亟需解决以推动技术发展和数字包容。

Method: 通过分析挑战（如数据稀缺、计算资源有限）和案例研究（如社区数据收集、轻量模型），提出定制化解决方案。

Result: 试点项目证明，社区驱动和多语言学习等方法可行，能提升ASR系统在非洲语言中的表现。

Conclusion: 需跨学科合作和持续投资，以开发高效、包容的ASR系统，保护语言多样性并促进社会经济参与。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies have transformed
human-computer interaction; however, low-resource languages in Africa remain
significantly underrepresented in both research and practical applications.
This study investigates the major challenges hindering the development of ASR
systems for these languages, which include data scarcity, linguistic
complexity, limited computational resources, acoustic variability, and ethical
concerns surrounding bias and privacy. The primary goal is to critically
analyze these barriers and identify practical, inclusive strategies to advance
ASR technologies within the African context. Recent advances and case studies
emphasize promising strategies such as community-driven data collection,
self-supervised and multilingual learning, lightweight model architectures, and
techniques that prioritize privacy. Evidence from pilot projects involving
various African languages showcases the feasibility and impact of customized
solutions, which encompass morpheme-based modeling and domain-specific ASR
applications in sectors like healthcare and education. The findings highlight
the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and sustained investment to
tackle the distinct linguistic and infrastructural challenges faced by the
continent. This study offers a progressive roadmap for creating ethical,
efficient, and inclusive ASR systems that not only safeguard linguistic
diversity but also improve digital accessibility and promote socioeconomic
participation for speakers of African languages.

*Ana Ezquerro,David Vilares,Anssi Yli-Jyrä,Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种基于层次括号的序列标记依赖解析编码家族，证明现有4位投影编码属于该家族但标签数量非最优，推导出最优层次括号编码，仅需12个标签（原需16个），并扩展支持非投影性，压缩性优于以往编码，实验表明新编码在多样树库上具竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4位投影编码在标签数量上非最优，需改进以更高效编码依赖树。

Method: 提出层次括号编码家族，推导最优编码（仅12标签），并扩展支持非投影性。

Result: 最优编码压缩性优于现有方法，实验显示在多样树库上表现竞争力。

Conclusion: 新编码在标签数量和压缩性上优于现有方法，适用于投影和非投影依赖树。

Abstract: We present a family of encodings for sequence labeling dependency parsing,
based on the concept of hierarchical bracketing. We prove that the existing
4-bit projective encoding belongs to this family, but it is suboptimal in the
number of labels used to encode a tree. We derive an optimal hierarchical
bracketing, which minimizes the number of symbols used and encodes projective
trees using only 12 distinct labels (vs. 16 for the 4-bit encoding). We also
extend optimal hierarchical bracketing to support arbitrary non-projectivity in
a more compact way than previous encodings. Our new encodings yield competitive
accuracy on a diverse set of treebanks.

Abstract: Multimodal reference resolution, including phrase grounding, aims to
understand the semantic relations between mentions and real-world objects.
Phrase grounding between images and their captions is a well-established task.
In contrast, for real-world applications, it is essential to integrate textual
and multimodal reference resolution to unravel the reference relations within
dialogue, especially in handling ambiguities caused by pronouns and ellipses.
This paper presents a framework that unifies textual and multimodal reference
resolution by mapping mention embeddings to object embeddings and selecting
mentions or objects based on their similarity. Our experiments show that
learning textual reference resolution, such as coreference resolution and
predicate-argument structure analysis, positively affects performance in
multimodal reference resolution. In particular, our model with coreference
resolution performs better in pronoun phrase grounding than representative
models for this task, MDETR and GLIP. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates
that incorporating textual reference relations strengthens the confidence
scores between mentions, including pronouns and predicates, and objects, which
can reduce the ambiguities that arise in visually grounded dialogues.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: MedCaseReasoning数据集首次评估LLMs在临床诊断推理中的表现，发现现有模型在诊断准确性和推理质量上存在不足，但通过微调可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学基准（如MedQA和MMLU）仅评估最终答案准确性，忽视了临床推理过程的质量和忠实性，因此需要新的评估方法。

Method: 引入MedCaseReasoning数据集，包含14,489个诊断问答案例及其详细推理陈述，用于评估和改进LLMs的临床推理能力。

Result: 现有模型表现不佳（如DeepSeek-R1诊断准确率48%），但微调后诊断准确性和推理召回率分别提升29%和41%。

Conclusion: MedCaseReasoning填补了医学LLMs评估的空白，并证明微调可显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Doctors and patients alike increasingly use Large Language Models (LLMs) to
diagnose clinical cases. However, unlike domains such as math or coding, where
correctness can be objectively defined by the final answer, medical diagnosis
requires both the outcome and the reasoning process to be accurate. Currently,
widely used medical benchmarks like MedQA and MMLU assess only accuracy in the
final answer, overlooking the quality and faithfulness of the clinical
reasoning process. To address this limitation, we introduce MedCaseReasoning,
the first open-access dataset for evaluating LLMs on their ability to align
with clinician-authored diagnostic reasoning. The dataset includes 14,489
diagnostic question-and-answer cases, each paired with detailed reasoning
statements derived from open-access medical case reports. We evaluate
state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs on MedCaseReasoning and find significant
shortcomings in their diagnoses and reasoning: for instance, the top-performing
open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, achieves only 48% 10-shot diagnostic accuracy
and mentions only 64% of the clinician reasoning statements (recall). However,
we demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on the reasoning traces derived from
MedCaseReasoning significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and clinical
reasoning recall by an average relative gain of 29% and 41%, respectively. The
open-source dataset, code, and models are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的LLM优化方法ZeroTuning，通过调整初始空语义令牌的注意力分布，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖辅助机制识别任务相关令牌，可能引入偏差且适用性有限。研究发现初始空语义令牌是一个未被充分探索的控制点。

Method: 通过理论分析发现初始令牌的注意力调整可优化模型行为，并提出ZeroTuning方法，仅调整该令牌的注意力分布。

Result: ZeroTuning在文本分类、问答和多轮对话任务中显著提升性能（如Llama-3.1-8B分类任务提升11.71%），且具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 初始空语义令牌是LLM中一个被忽视的控制点，ZeroTuning为推理时优化和模型可解释性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recently, training-free methods for improving large language models (LLMs)
have attracted growing interest, with token-level attention tuning emerging as
a promising and interpretable direction. However, existing methods typically
rely on auxiliary mechanisms to identify important or irrelevant task-specific
tokens, introducing potential bias and limiting applicability. In this paper,
we uncover a surprising and elegant alternative: the semantically empty initial
token is a powerful and underexplored control point for optimizing model
behavior. Through theoretical analysis, we show that tuning the initial token's
attention sharpens or flattens the attention distribution over subsequent
tokens, and its role as an attention sink amplifies this effect. Empirically,
we find that: (1) tuning its attention improves LLM performance more
effectively than tuning other task-specific tokens; (2) the effect follows a
consistent trend across layers, with earlier layers having greater impact, but
varies across attention heads, with different heads showing distinct
preferences in how they attend to this token. Based on these findings, we
propose ZeroTuning, a training-free approach that improves LLM performance by
applying head-specific attention adjustments to this special token. Despite
tuning only one token, ZeroTuning achieves higher performance on text
classification, multiple-choice, and multi-turn conversation tasks across
models such as Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek. For example, ZeroTuning improves
Llama-3.1-8B by 11.71% on classification, 2.64% on QA tasks, and raises its
multi-turn score from 7.804 to 7.966. The method is also robust to limited
resources, few-shot settings, long contexts, quantization, decoding strategies,
and prompt variations. Our work sheds light on a previously overlooked control
point in LLMs, offering new insights into both inference-time tuning and model
interpretability.

*Xianglong Xu,John Bowen,Rojin Taheri*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 通过随机掩码输入标记的简单方法提升基于Transformer的文本分类模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索掩码输入标记是否能进一步提升Transformer模型在文本分类中的表现。

Method: 提出令牌掩码正则化方法，随机用[MASK]替换输入标记，引入随机扰动以增强模型对标记间依赖的捕捉。

Result: 在语言识别和情感分析任务中，相比标准正则化方法，性能一致提升，最佳掩码率为0.1。

Conclusion: 掩码正则化通过减少过拟合和梯度平滑（隐式集成）提升模型性能，0.1的掩码率为通用推荐值。

Abstract: While transformer-based models achieve strong performance on text
classification, we explore whether masking input tokens can further enhance
their effectiveness. We propose token masking regularization, a simple yet
theoretically motivated method that randomly replaces input tokens with a
special [MASK] token at probability p. This introduces stochastic perturbations
during training, leading to implicit gradient averaging that encourages the
model to capture deeper inter-token dependencies. Experiments on language
identification and sentiment analysis -- across diverse models (mBERT,
Qwen2.5-0.5B, TinyLlama-1.1B) -- show consistent improvements over standard
regularization techniques. We identify task-specific optimal masking rates,
with p = 0.1 as a strong general default. We attribute the gains to two key
effects: (1) input perturbation reduces overfitting, and (2) gradient-level
smoothing acts as implicit ensembling.

Abstract: Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) adds layers of complexity to question
answering, making it more challenging. When Language Models (LMs) are prompted
with multiple search results, they are tasked not only with retrieving relevant
information but also employing multi-hop reasoning across the information
sources. Although LMs perform well on traditional question-answering tasks, the
causal mask can hinder their capacity to reason across complex contexts. In
this paper, we explore how LMs respond to multi-hop questions by permuting
search results (retrieved documents) under various configurations. Our study
reveals interesting findings as follows: 1) Encoder-decoder models, such as the
ones in the Flan-T5 family, generally outperform causal decoder-only LMs in
MHQA tasks, despite being significantly smaller in size; 2) altering the order
of gold documents reveals distinct trends in both Flan T5 models and fine-tuned
decoder-only models, with optimal performance observed when the document order
aligns with the reasoning chain order; 3) enhancing causal decoder-only models
with bi-directional attention by modifying the causal mask can effectively
boost their end performance. In addition to the above, we conduct a thorough
investigation of the distribution of LM attention weights in the context of
MHQA. Our experiments reveal that attention weights tend to peak at higher
values when the resulting answer is correct. We leverage this finding to
heuristically improve LMs' performance on this task. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/hwy9855/MultiHopQA-Reasoning.

Motivation: 传统NSM解释生成过程缓慢且手动，限制了其在自然语言处理（NLP）中的应用。研究旨在利用LLMs提升效率并探索通用语义表示的可能性。

Method: 研究引入自动评估方法、定制数据集，并微调1B和8B模型，用于生成NSM解释。

Result: 1B和8B模型在生成准确且可跨语言翻译的NSM解释上表现优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLMs在通用语义表示中的应用开辟了新途径，为语义分析、翻译等任务提供了新可能性。

Abstract: The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) is a linguistic theory based on a
universal set of semantic primes: simple, primitive word-meanings that have
been shown to exist in most, if not all, languages of the world. According to
this framework, any word, regardless of complexity, can be paraphrased using
these primes, revealing a clear and universally translatable meaning. These
paraphrases, known as explications, can offer valuable applications for many
natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but producing them has traditionally
been a slow, manual process. In this work, we present the first study of using
large language models (LLMs) to generate NSM explications. We introduce
automatic evaluation methods, a tailored dataset for training and evaluation,
and fine-tuned models for this task. Our 1B and 8B models outperform GPT-4o in
producing accurate, cross-translatable explications, marking a significant step
toward universal semantic representation with LLMs and opening up new
possibilities for applications in semantic analysis, translation, and beyond.

Result: 在ScienceWorld、ALFWorld和Webshop环境中，Retrospex表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Retrospex通过有效利用过去经验，显著提升了LLM智能体的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and commonsense
reasoning capabilities, making them valuable for creating powerful agents.
However, existing LLM agent frameworks have not fully utilized past experiences
for improvement. This work introduces a new LLM-based agent framework called
Retrospex, which addresses this challenge by analyzing past experiences in
depth. Unlike previous approaches, Retrospex does not directly integrate
experiences into the LLM's context. Instead, it combines the LLM's action
likelihood with action values estimated by a Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Critic, which is trained on past experiences through an offline
''retrospection'' process. Additionally, Retrospex employs a dynamic action
rescoring mechanism that increases the importance of experience-based values
for tasks that require more interaction with the environment. We evaluate
Retrospex in ScienceWorld, ALFWorld and Webshop environments, demonstrating its
advantages over strong, contemporary baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大型语言模型在特定领域（如文言文）表现不佳，微调开源基础模型也难以充分融入领域知识，因此需要专门设计的模型。

Method: 开发了AI Taiyan模型，通过合理的模型设计、数据处理、基础训练和微调，仅用18亿参数。

Conclusion: 该研究为高效构建特定领域大型语言模型提供了参考，并探讨了其在古籍整理、词典编辑和语言研究中的应用。

Abstract: General-purpose large language models demonstrate notable capabilities in
language comprehension and generation, achieving results that are comparable
to, or even surpass, human performance in many language information processing
tasks. Nevertheless, when general models are applied to some specific domains,
e.g., Classical Chinese texts, their effectiveness is often unsatisfactory, and
fine-tuning open-source foundational models similarly struggles to adequately
incorporate domain-specific knowledge. To address this challenge, this study
developed a large language model, AI Taiyan, specifically designed for
understanding and generating Classical Chinese. Experiments show that with a
reasonable model design, data processing, foundational training, and
fine-tuning, satisfactory results can be achieved with only 1.8 billion
parameters. In key tasks related to Classical Chinese information processing
such as punctuation, identification of allusions, explanation of word meanings,
and translation between ancient and modern Chinese, this model exhibits a clear
advantage over both general-purpose large models and domain-specific
traditional models, achieving levels close to or surpassing human baselines.
This research provides a reference for the efficient construction of
specialized domain-specific large language models. Furthermore, the paper
discusses the application of this model in fields such as the collation of
ancient texts, dictionary editing, and language research, combined with case
studies.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (QA) involves finding multiple relevant passages
and performing step-by-step reasoning to answer complex questions. Previous
works on multi-hop QA employ specific methods from different modeling
perspectives based on large language models (LLMs), regardless of the question
types. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of public multi-hop
QA benchmarks, dividing the questions into four types and evaluating five types
of cutting-edge methods for multi-hop QA: Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Single-step,
Iterative-step, Sub-step, and Adaptive-step. We find that different types of
multi-hop questions have varying degrees of sensitivity to different types of
methods. Thus, we propose a Bi-levEL muLti-agEnt reasoning (BELLE) framework to
address multi-hop QA by specifically focusing on the correspondence between
question types and methods, where each type of method is regarded as an
''operator'' by prompting LLMs differently. The first level of BELLE includes
multiple agents that debate to obtain an executive plan of combined
''operators'' to address the multi-hop QA task comprehensively. During the
debate, in addition to the basic roles of affirmative debater, negative
debater, and judge, at the second level, we further leverage fast and slow
debaters to monitor whether changes in viewpoints are reasonable. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BELLE significantly outperforms strong baselines
in various datasets. Additionally, the model consumption of BELLE is higher
cost-effectiveness than that of single models in more complex multi-hop QA
scenarios.

Motivation: 为了解决模型训练和推理中的效率与灵活性问题，提出了一种新的学习范式，通过链式结构优化隐藏状态表示。

Method: 引入Chain-of-Representation（CoR）概念，将隐藏状态分解为多个子表示链，并设计CoLM和CoLM-Air模型，利用KV共享机制提升性能。

Conclusion: CoM范式为语言模型的构建提供了新的方向，兼具高效训练和灵活部署的优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm, termed Chain-of-Model
(CoM), which incorporates the causal relationship into the hidden states of
each layer as a chain style, thereby introducing great scaling efficiency in
model training and inference flexibility in deployment. We introduce the
concept of Chain-of-Representation (CoR), which formulates the hidden states at
each layer as a combination of multiple sub-representations (i.e., chains) at
the hidden dimension level. In each layer, each chain from the output
representations can only view all of its preceding chains in the input
representations. Consequently, the model built upon CoM framework can
progressively scale up the model size by increasing the chains based on the
previous models (i.e., chains), and offer multiple sub-models at varying sizes
for elastic inference by using different chain numbers. Based on this
principle, we devise Chain-of-Language-Model (CoLM), which incorporates the
idea of CoM into each layer of Transformer architecture. Based on CoLM, we
further introduce CoLM-Air by introducing a KV sharing mechanism, that computes
all keys and values within the first chain and then shares across all chains.
This design demonstrates additional extensibility, such as enabling seamless LM
switching, prefilling acceleration and so on. Experimental results demonstrate
our CoLM family can achieve comparable performance to the standard Transformer,
while simultaneously enabling greater flexiblity, such as progressive scaling
to improve training efficiency and offer multiple varying model sizes for
elastic inference, paving a a new way toward building language models. Our code
will be released in the future at: https://github.com/microsoft/CoLM.

Conclusion: Long⊗Short框架通过区分思维重要性，实现了更高效和简洁的推理，为LLM推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Compressing long chain-of-thought (CoT) from large language models (LLMs) is
an emerging strategy to improve the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. Despite its
promising benefits, existing studies equally compress all thoughts within a
long CoT, hindering more concise and effective reasoning. To this end, we first
investigate the importance of different thoughts by examining their
effectiveness and efficiency in contributing to reasoning through automatic
long CoT chunking and Monte Carlo rollouts. Building upon the insights, we
propose a theoretically bounded metric to jointly measure the effectiveness and
efficiency of different thoughts. We then propose Long$\otimes$Short, an
efficient reasoning framework that enables two LLMs to collaboratively solve
the problem: a long-thought LLM for more effectively generating important
thoughts, while a short-thought LLM for efficiently generating remaining
thoughts. Specifically, we begin by synthesizing a small amount of cold-start
data to fine-tune LLMs for long-thought and short-thought reasoning styles,
respectively. Furthermore, we propose a synergizing-oriented multi-turn
reinforcement learning, focusing on the model self-evolution and collaboration
between long-thought and short-thought LLMs. Experimental results show that our
method enables Qwen2.5-7B and Llama3.1-8B to achieve comparable performance
compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, while
reducing token length by over 80% across the MATH500, AIME24/25, AMC23, and

Abstract: Detecting deviant language such as sexism, or nuanced language such as
metaphors or sarcasm, is crucial for enhancing the safety, clarity, and
interpretation of online social discourse. While existing classifiers deliver
strong results on these tasks, they often come with significant computational
cost and high data demands. In this work, we propose \textbf{Cla}ss
\textbf{D}istillation (ClaD), a novel training paradigm that targets the core
challenge: distilling a small, well-defined target class from a highly diverse
and heterogeneous background. ClaD integrates two key innovations: (i) a loss
function informed by the structural properties of class distributions, based on
Mahalanobis distance, and (ii) an interpretable decision algorithm optimized
for class separation. Across three benchmark detection tasks -- sexism,
metaphor, and sarcasm -- ClaD outperforms competitive baselines, and even with
smaller language models and orders of magnitude fewer parameters, achieves
performance comparable to several large language models (LLMs). These results
demonstrate ClaD as an efficient tool for pragmatic language understanding
tasks that require gleaning a small target class from a larger heterogeneous
background.

Abstract: The robustness and security of large language models (LLMs) has become a
prominent research area. One notable vulnerability is the ability to bypass LLM
safeguards by translating harmful queries into rare or underrepresented
languages, a simple yet effective method of "jailbreaking" these models.
Despite the growing concern, there has been limited research addressing the
safeguarding of LLMs in multilingual scenarios, highlighting an urgent need to
enhance multilingual safety. In this work, we investigate the correlation
between various attack features across different languages and propose
Multilingual Collaborative Defense (MCD), a novel learning method that
optimizes a continuous, soft safety prompt automatically to facilitate
multilingual safeguarding of LLMs. The MCD approach offers three advantages:
First, it effectively improves safeguarding performance across multiple
languages. Second, MCD maintains strong generalization capabilities while
minimizing false refusal rates. Third, MCD mitigates the language safety
misalignment caused by imbalances in LLM training corpora. To evaluate the
effectiveness of MCD, we manually construct multilingual versions of commonly
used jailbreak benchmarks, such as MaliciousInstruct and AdvBench, to assess
various safeguarding methods. Additionally, we introduce these datasets in
underrepresented (zero-shot) languages to verify the language transferability
of MCD. The results demonstrate that MCD outperforms existing approaches in
safeguarding against multilingual jailbreak attempts while also exhibiting
strong language transfer capabilities. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have fueled the vision of
automated scientific discovery, often called AI Co-Scientists. To date, prior
work casts these systems as generative co-authors responsible for crafting
hypotheses, synthesizing code, or drafting manuscripts. In this work, we
explore a complementary application: using LLMs as verifiers to automate the
\textbf{academic verification of scientific manuscripts}. To that end, we
introduce SPOT, a dataset of 83 published papers paired with 91 errors
significant enough to prompt errata or retraction, cross-validated with actual
authors and human annotators. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on SPOT, we find
that none surpasses 21.1\% recall or 6.1\% precision (o3 achieves the best
scores, with all others near zero). Furthermore, confidence estimates are
uniformly low, and across eight independent runs, models rarely rediscover the
same errors, undermining their reliability. Finally, qualitative analysis with
domain experts reveals that even the strongest models make mistakes resembling
student-level misconceptions derived from misunderstandings. These findings
highlight the substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and the
requirements for dependable AI-assisted academic verification.

TLDR: NAMET是一种通过引入噪声改进大规模知识编辑效果的方法，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型编辑方法在大规模编辑场景下效果不佳，主要由于知识项之间的嵌入冲突。

Method: 提出NAMET，通过在MEMIT中引入噪声来改进记忆提取。

Result: 在六个LLM和三个数据集上的实验显示，NAMET在大规模编辑中表现更优。

Conclusion: NAMET通过简单修改显著提升了大规模知识编辑的可靠性。

Abstract: Model editing techniques are essential for efficiently updating knowledge in
large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of existing approaches
degrades in massive editing scenarios, particularly when evaluated with
practical metrics or in context-rich settings. We attribute these failures to
embedding collisions among knowledge items, which undermine editing reliability
at scale. To address this, we propose NAMET (Noise-aware Model Editing in
Transformers), a simple yet effective method that introduces noise during
memory extraction via a one-line modification to MEMIT. Extensive experiments

TLDR: AutoMedEval是一个开源的自动评估模型，专为评估医学领域大型语言模型（LLMs）的问答能力而设计，旨在减少对人类评估的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标（如F1和ROUGE）忽视了医学术语的重要性，而人类评估成本高且可能存在不准确性。现有基于LLM的评估方法在医学领域适用性有限。

Method: 提出AutoMedEval，采用分层训练方法（课程指令调优和迭代知识内省机制），以有限指令数据获得专业医学评估能力。

Result: AutoMedEval在相关性上优于其他基线方法，与人类评估结果更一致。

Conclusion: AutoMedEval为医学LLM评估提供了一种高效、可靠的解决方案，显著降低了对人类评估的依赖。

Abstract: With the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain,
there is increasing demand for improved evaluation techniques to assess their
capabilities. However, traditional metrics like F1 and ROUGE, which rely on
token overlaps to measure quality, significantly overlook the importance of
medical terminology. While human evaluation tends to be more reliable, it can
be very costly and may as well suffer from inaccuracies due to limits in human
expertise and motivation. Although there are some evaluation methods based on
LLMs, their usability in the medical field is limited due to their proprietary
nature or lack of expertise. To tackle these challenges, we present
AutoMedEval, an open-sourced automatic evaluation model with 13B parameters
specifically engineered to measure the question-answering proficiency of
medical LLMs. The overarching objective of AutoMedEval is to assess the quality
of responses produced by diverse models, aspiring to significantly reduce the
dependence on human evaluation. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical
training method involving curriculum instruction tuning and an iterative
knowledge introspection mechanism, enabling AutoMedEval to acquire professional
medical assessment capabilities with limited instructional data. Human
evaluations indicate that AutoMedEval surpasses other baselines in terms of
correlation with human judgments.

Result: Mobile-Bench-v2通过多路径评估、噪声环境和模糊指令测试，全面评估了移动代理的能力。

Conclusion: Mobile-Bench-v2为移动代理提供了一个更真实和全面的评估基准，解决了现有基准的局限性。

Abstract: VLM-based mobile agents are increasingly popular due to their capabilities to
interact with smartphone GUIs and XML-structured texts and to complete daily
tasks. However, existing online benchmarks struggle with obtaining stable
reward signals due to dynamic environmental changes. Offline benchmarks
evaluate the agents through single-path trajectories, which stands in contrast
to the inherently multi-solution characteristics of GUI tasks. Additionally,
both types of benchmarks fail to assess whether mobile agents can handle noise
or engage in proactive interactions due to a lack of noisy apps or overly full
instructions during the evaluation process. To address these limitations, we
use a slot-based instruction generation method to construct a more realistic
and comprehensive benchmark named Mobile-Bench-v2. Mobile-Bench-v2 includes a
common task split, with offline multi-path evaluation to assess the agent's
ability to obtain step rewards during task execution. It contains a noisy split
based on pop-ups and ads apps, and a contaminated split named AITZ-Noise to
formulate a real noisy environment. Furthermore, an ambiguous instruction split
with preset Q\&A interactions is released to evaluate the agent's proactive
interaction capabilities. We conduct evaluations on these splits using the
single-agent framework AppAgent-v1, the multi-agent framework Mobile-Agent-v2,
as well as other mobile agents such as UI-Tars and OS-Atlas. Code and data are
available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/xwk123/MobileBench-v2.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的自适应规划框架（RLAP），通过建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）并利用轻量级Actor模型优化子任务顺序，提升LLM在多步NLP任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视实例的语言特征，依赖LLM固有规划能力，导致结果不理想。

Method: 将NLP任务建模为MDP，训练Actor模型估计Q值，结合LLM动态确定子任务顺序。

Result: 在三种NLP任务上验证了RLAP的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RLAP通过强化学习优化规划，显著提升LLM在多步任务中的性能。

Abstract: Multi-step planning has been widely employed to enhance the performance of
large language models (LLMs) on downstream natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, which decomposes the original task into multiple subtasks and guide LLMs
to solve them sequentially without additional training. When addressing task
instances, existing methods either preset the order of steps or attempt
multiple paths at each step. However, these methods overlook instances'
linguistic features and rely on the intrinsic planning capabilities of LLMs to
evaluate intermediate feedback and then select subtasks, resulting in
suboptimal outcomes. To better solve multi-step NLP tasks with LLMs, in this
paper we propose a Reinforcement Learning enhanced Adaptive Planning framework
(RLAP). In our framework, we model an NLP task as a Markov decision process
(MDP) and employ an LLM directly into the environment. In particular, a
lightweight Actor model is trained to estimate Q-values for natural language
sequences consisting of states and actions through reinforcement learning.
Therefore, during sequential planning, the linguistic features of each sequence
in the MDP can be taken into account, and the Actor model interacts with the
LLM to determine the optimal order of subtasks for each task instance. We apply
RLAP on three different types of NLP tasks and conduct extensive experiments on
multiple datasets to verify RLAP's effectiveness and robustness.

Result: 提出了ReQAP方法，并发布了PerQA基准测试，涵盖多样化的现实用户需求。

Conclusion: ReQAP为混合源问答提供了一种高效且隐私保护的方法，PerQA基准测试支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Question answering over mixed sources, like text and tables, has been
advanced by verbalizing all contents and encoding it with a language model. A
prominent case of such heterogeneous data is personal information: user devices
log vast amounts of data every day, such as calendar entries, workout
statistics, shopping records, streaming history, and more. Information needs
range from simple look-ups to queries of analytical nature. The challenge is to
provide humans with convenient access with small footprint, so that all
personal data stays on the user devices. We present ReQAP, a novel method that
creates an executable operator tree for a given question, via recursive
decomposition. Operators are designed to enable seamless integration of
structured and unstructured sources, and the execution of the operator tree
yields a traceable answer. We further release the PerQA benchmark, with
persona-based data and questions, covering a diverse spectrum of realistic user
needs.

Result: 在长上下文QA基准测试中表现优于基线方法，存储和运行时间减少一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有RAG系统的局限性，同时显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural
language processing, but their limited ability to retain long-term context
constrains performance on document-level or multi-turn tasks.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by retrieving relevant
information from an external corpus. However, existing RAG systems often rely
on embedding-based retrieval trained on corpus-level semantic similarity, which
can lead to retrieving content that is semantically similar in form but
misaligned with the question's true intent. Furthermore, recent RAG variants
construct graph- or hierarchy-based structures to improve retrieval accuracy,
resulting in significant computation and storage overhead. In this paper, we
propose an embedding-free retrieval framework. Our method leverages the logical
inferencing ability of LLMs in retrieval using iterative search space
refinement guided by our novel importance measure and extend our retrieval
results with logically related information without explicit graph construction.
Experiments on long-context QA benchmarks, including NovelQA and Marathon, show
that our approach outperforms strong baselines while reducing storage and
runtime by over an order of magnitude.

Method: 提出MISO框架，将顺序指令分解为并行子上下文指令，并采用混合上下文范式优化SFT。

Result: 实验表明MISO在复杂指令跟随任务中表现优越，且训练效率高。

Conclusion: MISO是一种有效的LLM微调方法，显著提升了复杂指令跟随能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in handling
natural language tasks; however, they may struggle to consistently follow
complex instructions including those involve multiple constraints.
Post-training LLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach to
improve their ability to follow instructions. In addressing complex instruction
following, existing efforts primarily focus on data-driven methods that
synthesize complex instruction-output pairs for SFT. However, insufficient
attention allocated to crucial sub-contexts may reduce the effectiveness of
SFT. In this work, we propose transforming sequentially structured input
instruction into multiple parallel instructions containing subcontexts. To
support processing this multi-input, we propose MISO (Multi-Input
Single-Output), an extension to currently dominant decoder-only
transformer-based LLMs. MISO introduces a mixture-of-contexts paradigm that
jointly considers the overall instruction-output alignment and the influence of
individual sub-contexts to enhance SFT effectiveness. We apply MISO fine-tuning
to complex instructionfollowing datasets and evaluate it with standard LLM
inference. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of MISO as a
fine-tuning method for LLMs, both in terms of effectiveness in complex
instruction-following scenarios and its potential for training efficiency.

Result: 实验显示，自我校正提示显著增强了语言模型对潜在概念的识别能力，尤其是在文本去毒任务中。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了自我校正的底层机制，为提示的可解释性提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We provide an explanation for the performance gains of intrinsic
self-correction, a process where a language model iteratively refines its
outputs without external feedback. More precisely, we investigate how prompting
induces interpretable changes in hidden states and thus affects the output
distributions. We hypothesize that each prompt-induced shift lies in a linear
span of some linear representation vectors, naturally separating tokens based
on individual concept alignment. Building around this idea, we give a
mathematical formulation of self-correction and derive a concentration result
for output tokens based on alignment magnitudes. Our experiments on text
detoxification with zephyr-7b-sft reveal a substantial gap in the inner
products of the prompt-induced shifts and the unembeddings of the top-100 most
toxic tokens vs. those of the unembeddings of the bottom-100 least toxic
tokens, under toxic instructions. This suggests that self-correction prompts
enhance a language model's capability of latent concept recognition. Our
analysis offers insights into the underlying mechanism of self-correction by
characterizing how prompting works explainably. For reproducibility, our code
is available.

Method: 设计最小但充分的BNF语法$G[q]$，构建查询表达式翻译器、词法语法解析器和递归下降处理器，将查询编译为AST。

Result: 子查询的原子性确保更精确的文档检索和响应生成，显著提升RAG系统处理复杂查询的能力。

Conclusion: QCompiler通过神经符号方法有效解决了复杂查询的识别问题，提升了RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: Precise recognition of search intent in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems remains a challenging goal, especially under resource constraints and
for complex queries with nested structures and dependencies. This paper
presents QCompiler, a neuro-symbolic framework inspired by linguistic grammar
rules and compiler design, to bridge this gap. It theoretically designs a
minimal yet sufficient Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar $G[q]$ to formalize
complex queries. Unlike previous methods, this grammar maintains completeness
while minimizing redundancy. Based on this, QCompiler includes a Query
Expression Translator, a Lexical Syntax Parser, and a Recursive Descent
Processor to compile queries into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for execution.
The atomicity of the sub-queries in the leaf nodes ensures more precise
document retrieval and response generation, significantly improving the RAG
system's ability to address complex queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图表编辑任务对MLLMs提出了更高的要求，但现有评估方法不足，亟需一个全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建了包含1,405条编辑指令和233个真实图表的ChartEdit基准，并评估了10种主流MLLMs的性能。

Result: 大模型能生成部分匹配参考图像的代码，但精确编辑能力有限（SOTA模型得分59.96）；小模型表现更差。

Conclusion: 图表编辑任务仍具挑战性，需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in generating
chart rendering code, chart editing presents a greater challenge. This
difficulty stems from its nature as a labor-intensive task for humans that also
demands MLLMs to integrate chart understanding, complex reasoning, and precise
intent interpretation. While many MLLMs claim such editing capabilities,
current assessments typically rely on limited case studies rather than robust
evaluation methodologies, highlighting the urgent need for a comprehensive
evaluation framework. In this work, we propose ChartEdit, a new high-quality
benchmark designed for chart editing tasks. This benchmark comprises $1,405$
diverse editing instructions applied to $233$ real-world charts, with each
instruction-chart instance having been manually annotated and validated for
accuracy. Utilizing ChartEdit, we evaluate the performance of 10 mainstream
MLLMs across two types of experiments, assessing them at both the code and
chart levels. The results suggest that large-scale models can generate code to
produce images that partially match the reference images. However, their
ability to generate accurate edits according to the instructions remains
limited. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) model achieves a score of only $59.96$,
highlighting significant challenges in precise modification. In contrast,
small-scale models, including chart-domain models, struggle both with following
editing instructions and generating overall chart images, underscoring the need
for further development in this area. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有研究仅关注单一属性的反仇恨言论生成，而多属性同时考虑可以产生更细致和有效的回应。

Method: HiPPrO采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过分层前缀嵌入空间优化属性特定前缀；第二阶段结合参考和无奖励偏好优化生成更具建设性的反仇恨言论。

Result: HiPPrO在意图一致性上提升了约38%，在Rouge-1、Rouge-2和Rouge-L上分别提升了3%、2%和3%。

Conclusion: 多属性条件能显著提升反仇恨言论生成系统的效果，HiPPrO展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Counterspeech has proven to be a powerful tool to combat hate speech online.
Previous studies have focused on generating counterspeech conditioned only on
specific intents (single attributed). However, a holistic approach considering
multiple attributes simultaneously can yield more nuanced and effective
responses. Here, we introduce HiPPrO, Hierarchical Prefix learning with
Preference Optimization, a novel two-stage framework that utilizes the
effectiveness of attribute-specific prefix embedding spaces hierarchically
optimized during the counterspeech generation process in the first phase.
Thereafter, we incorporate both reference and reward-free preference
optimization to generate more constructive counterspeech. Furthermore, we
extend IntentCONANv2 by annotating all 13,973 counterspeech instances with
emotion labels by five annotators. HiPPrO leverages hierarchical prefix
optimization to integrate these dual attributes effectively. An extensive
evaluation demonstrates that HiPPrO achieves a ~38 % improvement in intent
conformity and a ~3 %, ~2 %, ~3 % improvement in Rouge-1, Rouge-2, and Rouge-L,
respectively, compared to several baseline models. Human evaluations further
substantiate the superiority of our approach, highlighting the enhanced
relevance and appropriateness of the generated counterspeech. This work
underscores the potential of multi-attribute conditioning in advancing the
efficacy of counterspeech generation systems.

others. A text can contain either single or multiple targets. Multiple
annotators are involved in the data annotation task. We calculated the
inter-annotator agreement, which was reported to be 0.86 for offensive content
and 0.71 for multiple hate speech targets. Finally, we evaluated the data
annotation task by employing a different transformers-based model in which

Abstract: Considering the inherent limitations of parametric knowledge in large
language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely employed
to expand their knowledge scope. Since RAG has shown promise in
knowledge-intensive tasks like open-domain question answering, its broader
application to complex tasks and intelligent assistants has further advanced
its utility. Despite this progress, the underlying knowledge utilization
mechanisms of LLM-based RAG remain underexplored. In this paper, we present a
systematic investigation of the intrinsic mechanisms by which LLMs integrate
internal (parametric) and external (retrieved) knowledge in RAG scenarios.
Specially, we employ knowledge stream analysis at the macroscopic level, and
investigate the function of individual modules at the microscopic level.
Drawing on knowledge streaming analyses, we decompose the knowledge utilization
process into four distinct stages within LLM layers: knowledge refinement,
knowledge elicitation, knowledge expression, and knowledge contestation. We
further demonstrate that the relevance of passages guides the streaming of
knowledge through these stages. At the module level, we introduce a new method,
knowledge activation probability entropy (KAPE) for neuron identification
associated with either internal or external knowledge. By selectively
deactivating these neurons, we achieve targeted shifts in the LLM's reliance on
one knowledge source over the other. Moreover, we discern complementary roles
for multi-head attention and multi-layer perceptron layers during knowledge
formation. These insights offer a foundation for improving interpretability and
reliability in retrieval-augmented LLMs, paving the way for more robust and
transparent generative solutions in knowledge-intensive domains.

Abstract: Argument mining has garnered increasing attention over the years, with the
recent advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) further propelling this
trend. However, current argument relations remain relatively simplistic and
foundational, struggling to capture the full scope of argument information,
particularly when it comes to representing complex argument structures in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose 14 fine-grained
relation types from both vertical and horizontal dimensions, thereby capturing
the intricate interplay between argument components for a thorough
understanding of argument structure. On this basis, we conducted extensive
experiments on three tasks: argument component detection, relation prediction,
and automated essay grading. Additionally, we explored the impact of writing
quality on argument component detection and relation prediction, as well as the
connections between discourse relations and argumentative features. The
findings highlight the importance of fine-grained argumentative annotations for
argumentative writing quality assessment and encourage multi-dimensional
argument analysis.

Method: 提出MoL框架，使用交叉熵损失（CE）优化领域数据，KL散度对齐通用语料与基础模型能力，采用1:1的语料比例。

Result: 在Math-500基准测试中，非思考推理模式准确率提升27.9%；在AIME25子集的思考模式中，性能提升83.3%。

Conclusion: MoL框架有效平衡了领域适应和通用能力，避免了灾难性遗忘，显著优于传统CPT方法。

Abstract: Although LLMs perform well in general tasks, domain-specific applications
suffer from hallucinations and accuracy limitations. CPT approaches encounter
two key issues: (1) domain-biased data degrades general language skills, and
(2) improper corpus-mixture ratios limit effective adaptation. To address
these, we propose a novel framework, Mixture of Losses (MoL), which decouples
optimization objectives for domain-specific and general corpora. Specifically,
cross-entropy (CE) loss is applied to domain data to ensure knowledge
acquisition, while Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence aligns general-corpus
training with the base model's foundational capabilities. This dual-loss
architecture preserves universal skills while enhancing domain expertise,
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, we validate that a 1:1
domain-to-general corpus ratio optimally balances training and overfitting
without the need for extensive tuning or resource-intensive experiments.
Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate significant performance gains compared
to traditional CPT approaches, which often suffer from degradation in general
language capabilities; our model achieves 27.9% higher accuracy on the Math-500
benchmark in the non-think reasoning mode, and an impressive 83.3% improvement
on the challenging AIME25 subset in the think mode, underscoring the
effectiveness of our approach.

### [46] [ABoN: Adaptive Best-of-N Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12050)
*Vinod Raman,Hilal Asi,Satyen Kale*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种基于提示自适应的Best-of-N对齐策略，通过两阶段算法更高效地分配推理计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有测试时对齐方法计算成本高的问题，特别是对不同难度提示的均匀计算分配效率低下。

Method: 开发了两阶段算法：初始探索阶段用小预算估计每个提示的奖励分布，第二阶段根据估计自适应分配剩余预算。

Result: 在AlpacaEval数据集上的实验表明，自适应策略在相同推理预算下优于均匀分配，且在大批量提示下性能提升。

Conclusion: 自适应策略简单实用，兼容任何LM/RM组合，能显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time alignment methods, such as Best-of-N sampling,
offer a simple and effective way to steer language models (LMs) toward
preferred behaviors using reward models (RM). However, these approaches can be
computationally expensive, especially when applied uniformly across prompts
without accounting for differences in alignment difficulty. In this work, we
propose a prompt-adaptive strategy for Best-of-N alignment that allocates
inference-time compute more efficiently. Motivated by latency concerns, we
develop a two-stage algorithm: an initial exploratory phase estimates the
reward distribution for each prompt using a small exploration budget, and a
second stage adaptively allocates the remaining budget using these estimates.
Our method is simple, practical, and compatible with any LM/RM combination.
Empirical results on the AlpacaEval dataset for 12 LM/RM pairs and 50 different
batches of prompts show that our adaptive strategy consistently outperforms the
uniform allocation with the same inference budget. Moreover, our experiments
show that our adaptive strategy remains competitive against uniform allocations
with 20% larger inference budgets and even improves in performance as the batch
size grows.

Result: 实验证明SAGE在多种LLMs上平均防御成功率达99%，同时保持通用任务的实用性。

Conclusion: SAGE揭示了LLMs安全检测与生成行为的不一致性，为未来LLMs的安全设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across
various tasks but remain vulnerable to meticulously crafted jailbreak attacks.
In this paper, we identify a critical safety gap: while LLMs are adept at
detecting jailbreak prompts, they often produce unsafe responses when directly
processing these inputs. Inspired by this insight, we propose SAGE (Self-Aware
Guard Enhancement), a training-free defense strategy designed to align LLMs'
strong safety discrimination performance with their relatively weaker safety
generation ability. SAGE consists of two core components: a Discriminative
Analysis Module and a Discriminative Response Module, enhancing resilience
against sophisticated jailbreak attempts through flexible safety discrimination
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAGE's effectiveness and
robustness across various open-source and closed-source LLMs of different sizes
and architectures, achieving an average 99% defense success rate against
numerous complex and covert jailbreak methods while maintaining helpfulness on
general benchmarks. We further conduct mechanistic interpretability analysis
through hidden states and attention distributions, revealing the underlying
mechanisms of this detection-generation discrepancy. Our work thus contributes
to developing future LLMs with coherent safety awareness and generation
behavior. Our code and datasets are publicly available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SAGE.

Conclusion: 形态生产力与形式和意义的系统性相关，个体语言产出受输入和语义结构影响。

Abstract: In this study, we approach morphological productivity from two perspectives:
a cognitive-computational perspective, and a diachronic perspective zooming in
on an actual speaker, Thomas Mann. For developing the first perspective, we
make use of a cognitive computational model of the mental lexicon, the
discriminative lexicon model. For computational mappings between form and
meaning to be productive, in the sense that novel, previously unencountered
words, can be understood and produced, there must be systematicities between
the form space and the semantic space. If the relation between form and meaning
would be truly arbitrary, a model could memorize form and meaning pairings, but
there is no way in which the model would be able to generalize to novel test
data. For Finnish nominal inflection, Malay derivation, and English
compounding, we explore, using the Discriminative Lexicon Model as a
computational tool, to trace differences in the degree to which inflectional
and word formation patterns are productive. We show that the DLM tends to
associate affix-like sublexical units with the centroids of the embeddings of
the words with a given affix. For developing the second perspective, we study
how the intake and output of one prolific writer, Thomas Mann, changes over
time. We show by means of an examination of what Thomas Mann is likely to have
read, and what he wrote, that the rate at which Mann produces novel derived
words is extremely low. There are far more novel words in his input than in his
output. We show that Thomas Mann is less likely to produce a novel derived word
with a given suffix the greater the average distance is of the embeddings of
all derived words to the corresponding centroid, and discuss the challenges of
using speaker-specific embeddings for low-frequency and novel words.

Conclusion: 支持结合使用指令和演示，但需进一步研究LLM任务推理机制。

Abstract: Demonstrations and instructions are two primary approaches for prompting
language models to perform in-context learning (ICL) tasks. Do identical tasks
elicited in different ways result in similar representations of the task? An
improved understanding of task representation mechanisms would offer
interpretability insights and may aid in steering models. We study this through
function vectors, recently proposed as a mechanism to extract few-shot ICL task
representations. We generalize function vectors to alternative task
presentations, focusing on short textual instruction prompts, and successfully
extract instruction function vectors that promote zero-shot task accuracy. We
find evidence that demonstration- and instruction-based function vectors
leverage different model components, and offer several controls to dissociate
their contributions to task performance. Our results suggest that different
task presentations do not induce a common task representation but elicit
different, partly overlapping mechanisms. Our findings offer principled support
to the practice of combining textual instructions and task demonstrations,
imply challenges in universally monitoring task inference across presentation
forms, and encourage further examinations of LLM task inference mechanisms.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising technique for enhancing large

relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation
of model merging techniques during the pre-training process. Through extensive
experiments with both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures ranging
from millions to over 100 billion parameters, we demonstrate that merging
checkpoints trained with constant learning rates not only achieves significant
performance improvements but also enables accurate prediction of annealing
behavior. These improvements lead to both more efficient model development and
significantly lower training costs. Our detailed ablation studies on merging
strategies and hyperparameters provide new insights into the underlying
mechanisms while uncovering novel applications. Through comprehensive
experimental analysis, we offer the open-source community practical
pre-training guidelines for effective model merging.

Result: LLMs整体有效，但效果呈现双峰分布，个性化提示方法优于标准方法。

Conclusion: 个性化提示方法能部分解决效果双峰分布问题，提升混淆效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in
obfuscating authorship by paraphrasing and altering writing styles. Rather than
adopting a holistic approach that evaluates performance across the entire
dataset, we focus on user-wise performance to analyze how obfuscation
effectiveness varies across individual authors. While LLMs are generally
effective, we observe a bimodal distribution of efficacy, with performance
varying significantly across users. To address this, we propose a personalized
prompting method that outperforms standard prompting techniques and partially
mitigates the bimodality issue.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在自然语言处理和生成AI中表现优异，但其预测中的偏见问题阻碍了其在涉及伦理敏感性和负责任决策任务中的应用。

Method: 通过修改句子中的特定属性生成多个变体，比较其预测行为与原句的差异，仅需前向传递（测试时对抗），无需训练或微调。

Result: 在Llama家族模型上实验表明，该方法显著提升了公平性指标，如减少种族群体间的差异，最高提升27个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法无需参数调整或训练数据修改，显著提升了LLM生成结果的公平性和可靠性，为伦理敏感任务的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) push the bound-aries in natural language
processing and generative AI, driving progress across various aspects of modern
society. Unfortunately, the pervasive issue of bias in LLMs responses (i.e.,
predictions) poses a significant and open challenge, hindering their
application in tasks involving ethical sensitivity and responsible
decision-making. In this work, we propose a straightforward, user-friendly and
practical method to mitigate such biases, enhancing the reliability and
trustworthiness of LLMs. Our method creates multiple variations of a given
sentence by modifying specific attributes and evaluates the corresponding
prediction behavior compared to the original, unaltered, prediction/sentence.
The idea behind this process is that critical ethical predictions often exhibit
notable inconsistencies, indicating the presence of bias. Unlike previous
approaches, our method relies solely on forward passes (i.e., testing-time
adversaries), eliminating the need for training, fine-tuning, or prior
knowledge of the training data distribution. Through extensive experiments on
the popular Llama family, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
improving various fairness metrics, focusing on the reduction of disparities in
how the model treats individuals from different racial groups. Specifically,
using standard metrics, we improve the fairness in Llama3 in up to 27
percentage points. Overall, our approach significantly enhances fairness,
equity, and reliability in LLM-generated results without parameter tuning or
training data modifications, confirming its effectiveness in practical
scenarios. We believe our work establishes an important step toward enabling
the use of LLMs in tasks that require ethical considerations and responsible
decision-making.

Abstract: Content moderation research has recently made significant advances, but still
fails to serve the majority of the world's languages due to the lack of
resources, leaving millions of vulnerable users to online hostility. This work
presents a large-scale human-annotated multi-task benchmark dataset for abusive
language detection in Tigrinya social media with joint annotations for three
tasks: abusiveness, sentiment, and topic classification. The dataset comprises
13,717 YouTube comments annotated by nine native speakers, collected from 7,373
videos with a total of over 1.2 billion views across 51 channels. We developed
an iterative term clustering approach for effective data selection. Recognizing
that around 64% of Tigrinya social media content uses Romanized
transliterations rather than native Ge'ez script, our dataset accommodates both
writing systems to reflect actual language use. We establish strong baselines
across the tasks in the benchmark, while leaving significant challenges for
future contributions. Our experiments reveal that small, specialized multi-task
models outperform the current frontier models in the low-resource setting,
achieving up to 86% accuracy (+7 points) in abusiveness detection. We make the
resources publicly available to promote research on online safety.

Motivation: 探讨SES如何影响人们与语言技术的互动，弥补以往依赖代理指标和合成数据的不足。

Method: 调查1000名不同SES背景的个体，收集6482条与LLM的互动提示。

Result: 高SES群体语言更抽象简洁，话题如“包容性”和“旅行”；低SES群体语言更具体且拟人化。

Conclusion: 需在语言技术开发中考虑SES差异，以减少数字鸿沟。

Abstract: Socioeconomic status (SES) fundamentally influences how people interact with
each other and more recently, with digital technologies like Large Language
Models (LLMs). While previous research has highlighted the interaction between
SES and language technology, it was limited by reliance on proxy metrics and
synthetic data. We survey 1,000 individuals from diverse socioeconomic
backgrounds about their use of language technologies and generative AI, and
collect 6,482 prompts from their previous interactions with LLMs. We find
systematic differences across SES groups in language technology usage (i.e.,
frequency, performed tasks), interaction styles, and topics. Higher SES entails
a higher level of abstraction, convey requests more concisely, and topics like
'inclusivity' and 'travel'. Lower SES correlates with higher
anthropomorphization of LLMs (using ''hello'' and ''thank you'') and more
concrete language. Our findings suggest that while generative language
technologies are becoming more accessible to everyone, socioeconomic linguistic
differences still stratify their use to exacerbate the digital divide. These
differences underscore the importance of considering SES in developing language
technologies to accommodate varying linguistic needs rooted in socioeconomic
factors and limit the AI Gap across SES groups.

Conclusion: 研究强调本地化NLP工具的重要性，为土耳其语情感分析提供实用工具，推动计算社会科学发展。

Abstract: Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) play a crucial role in
shaping public discourse and societal norms. This study examines the term
Sessiz Istila (Silent Invasion) on Turkish social media, highlighting the rise
of anti-refugee sentiment amidst the Syrian refugee influx. Using BERTurk and
the TREMO dataset, we developed an advanced Emotion Recognition Model (ERM)
tailored for Turkish, achieving 92.62% accuracy in categorizing emotions such
as happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and surprise. By applying this
model to large-scale X data, the study uncovers emotional nuances in Turkish
discourse, contributing to computational social science by advancing sentiment
analysis in underrepresented languages and enhancing our understanding of
global digital discourse and the unique linguistic challenges of Turkish. The
findings underscore the transformative potential of localized NLP tools, with
our ERM model offering practical applications for real-time sentiment analysis
in Turkish-language contexts. By addressing critical areas, including
marketing, public relations, and crisis management, these models facilitate
improved decision-making through timely and accurate sentiment tracking. This
highlights the significance of advancing research that accounts for regional

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success and deployment across diverse workflows,
language models sometimes produce untruthful responses. Our limited
understanding of how truthfulness is mechanistically encoded within these
models jeopardizes their reliability and safety. In this paper, we propose a
method for identifying representations of truthfulness at the neuron level. We
show that language models contain truth neurons, which encode truthfulness in a
subject-agnostic manner. Experiments conducted across models of varying scales
validate the existence of truth neurons, confirming that the encoding of
truthfulness at the neuron level is a property shared by many language models.
The distribution patterns of truth neurons over layers align with prior
findings on the geometry of truthfulness. Selectively suppressing the
activations of truth neurons found through the TruthfulQA dataset degrades
performance both on TruthfulQA and on other benchmarks, showing that the
truthfulness mechanisms are not tied to a specific dataset. Our results offer
novel insights into the mechanisms underlying truthfulness in language models
and highlight potential directions toward improving their trustworthiness and
reliability.

Abstract: The widespread integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
sectors has highlighted the need for empirical research to understand their
biases, thought patterns, and societal implications to ensure ethical and
effective use. In this study, we propose a novel framework for evaluating LLMs,
focusing on uncovering their ideological biases through a quantitative analysis
of 436 binary-choice questions, many of which have no definitive answer. By
applying our framework to ChatGPT and Gemini, findings revealed that while LLMs
generally maintain consistent opinions on many topics, their ideologies differ
across models and languages. Notably, ChatGPT exhibits a tendency to change
their opinion to match the questioner's opinion. Both models also exhibited
problematic biases, unethical or unfair claims, which might have negative
societal impacts. These results underscore the importance of addressing both
ideological and ethical considerations when evaluating LLMs. The proposed
framework offers a flexible, quantitative method for assessing LLM behavior,
providing valuable insights for the development of more socially aligned AI

Result: 结果显示，随着模型规模增大，预测能力出现反转，表明LLMs与人类句子处理存在显著偏差。

Conclusion: 模型规模的增大可能加剧LLMs与人类句子处理的偏差，而非改善预测能力。

Abstract: The impressive linguistic abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
recommended them as models of human sentence processing, with some conjecturing
a positive 'quality-power' relationship (Wilcox et al., 2023), in which
language models' (LMs') fit to psychometric data continues to improve as their
ability to predict words in context increases. This is important because it
suggests that elements of LLM architecture, such as veridical attention to
context and a unique objective of predicting upcoming words, reflect the
architecture of the human sentence processing faculty, and that any
inadequacies in predicting human reading time and brain imaging data may be
attributed to insufficient model complexity, which recedes as larger models
become available. Recent studies (Oh and Schuler, 2023) have shown this scaling
inverts after a point, as LMs become excessively large and accurate, when word
prediction probability (as information-theoretic surprisal) is used as a
predictor. Other studies propose the use of entire vectors from differently
sized LLMs, still showing positive scaling (Schrimpf et al., 2021), casting
doubt on the value of surprisal as a predictor, but do not control for the
larger number of predictors in vectors from larger LMs. This study evaluates
LLM scaling using entire LLM vectors, while controlling for the larger number
of predictors in vectors from larger LLMs. Results show that inverse scaling
obtains, suggesting that inadequacies in predicting human reading time and
brain imaging data may be due to substantial misalignment between LLMs and
human sentence processing, which worsens as larger models are used.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a popular evaluation strategy, where advanced
large language models assess generation results in alignment with human

annotators, their reliability in multilingual evaluation remains uncertain. To
bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multilingual
LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, we evaluate five models from different model
families across five diverse tasks involving 25 languages. Our findings reveal
that LLMs struggle to achieve consistent judgment results across languages,
with an average Fleiss' Kappa of approximately 0.3, and some models performing
even worse. To investigate the cause of inconsistency, we analyze various
influencing factors. We observe that consistency varies significantly across
languages, with particularly poor performance in low-resource languages.
Additionally, we find that neither training on multilingual data nor increasing
model scale directly improves judgment consistency. These findings suggest that
LLMs are not yet reliable for evaluating multilingual predictions. We finally
propose an ensemble strategy which improves the consistency of the multilingual
judge in real-world applications.

TLDR: Data Whisperer是一种无需训练的注意力方法，通过少样本上下文学习优化数据选择，显著提升性能并减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据集规模增长，传统数据选择方法效率低且资源消耗大，需更高效的方法。

Method: 利用少样本上下文学习，结合注意力机制，无需额外训练评分模型。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型上，仅用10%数据即优于全数据集，性能提升3.1分，速度提升7.4倍。

Conclusion: Data Whisperer为高效数据选择提供了新思路，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on task-specific data is essential
for their effective deployment. As dataset sizes grow, efficiently selecting
optimal subsets for training becomes crucial to balancing performance and
computational costs. Traditional data selection methods often require
fine-tuning a scoring model on the target dataset, which is time-consuming and
resource-intensive, or rely on heuristics that fail to fully leverage the
model's predictive capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Data
Whisperer, an efficient, training-free, attention-based method that leverages
few-shot in-context learning with the model to be fine-tuned. Comprehensive
evaluations were conducted on both raw and synthetic datasets across diverse
tasks and models. Notably, Data Whisperer achieves superior performance
compared to the full GSM8K dataset on the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, using just
10% of the data, and outperforms existing methods with a 3.1-point improvement
and a 7.4$\times$ speedup.

Method: 提出GMSA框架，包含分组合并和层语义对齐，通过自编码器训练和知识提取微调（KEFT）优化。

Result: 在上下文恢复和下游QA任务中表现优于传统方法，实现2倍加速和显著性能提升。

Conclusion: GMSA有效提升LLMs在长上下文任务中的效率和性能，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in a
variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, when applied to
long-context scenarios, they face two challenges, i.e., low computational
efficiency and much redundant information. This paper introduces GMSA, a
context compression framework based on the encoder-decoder architecture, which
addresses these challenges by reducing input sequence length and redundant
information. Structurally, GMSA has two key components: Group Merging and Layer
Semantic Alignment (LSA). Group merging is used to effectively and efficiently
extract summary vectors from the original context. Layer semantic alignment, on
the other hand, aligns the high-level summary vectors with the low-level
primary input semantics, thus bridging the semantic gap between different
layers. In the training process, GMSA first learns soft tokens that contain
complete semantics through autoencoder training. To furtherly adapt GMSA to
downstream tasks, we propose Knowledge Extraction Fine-tuning (KEFT) to extract
knowledge from the soft tokens for downstream tasks. We train GMSA by randomly
sampling the compression rate for each sample in the dataset. Under this
condition, GMSA not only significantly outperforms the traditional compression
paradigm in context restoration but also achieves stable and significantly
faster convergence with only a few encoder layers. In downstream
question-answering (QA) tasks, GMSA can achieve approximately a 2x speedup in
end-to-end inference while outperforming both the original input prompts and
various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a large margin.

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法在处理多用户请求时效率低下，无法满足实时需求。

Method: 引入StratNet学习剪枝策略，利用高斯过程近似评估过程，解决非可微问题。

Result: UniCuCo比基线方法快28倍，同时保持相近的准确性。

Conclusion: UniCuCo为多用户剪枝请求提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing pruning methods for large language models (LLMs) focus on achieving
high compression rates while maintaining model performance. Although these
methods have demonstrated satisfactory performance in handling a single user's
compression request, their processing time increases linearly with the number
of requests, making them inefficient for real-world scenarios with multiple
simultaneous requests. To address this limitation, we propose a Univeral Model
for Customized Compression (UniCuCo) for LLMs, which introduces a StratNet that
learns to map arbitrary requests to their optimal pruning strategy. The
challenge in training StratNet lies in the high computational cost of
evaluating pruning strategies and the non-differentiable nature of the pruning
process, which hinders gradient backpropagation for StratNet updates. To
overcome these challenges, we leverage a Gaussian process to approximate the
evaluation process. Since the gradient of the Gaussian process is computable,
we can use it to approximate the gradient of the non-differentiable pruning
process, thereby enabling StratNet updates. Experimental results show that
UniCuCo is 28 times faster than baselines in processing 64 requests, while
maintaining comparable accuracy to baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多通过定量方法分析LLMs在学术写作中的使用，但缺乏对其语言特征影响的系统性研究。

Method: 对arXiv数据集近十年823,798篇摘要进行语言特征分析，包括词汇偏好、复杂性、连贯性、可读性和情感等。

Result: LLM偏好的词汇比例显著增加，词汇复杂性提高，句法复杂性降低，连贯性和可读性下降。英语能力较弱的学者更倾向使用LLMs。

Conclusion: LLMs显著改变了学术写作风格，尤其在计算机科学领域，但对数学领域影响较小。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have prompted academic
concerns about their impact on academic writing. Existing studies have
primarily examined LLM usage in academic writing through quantitative
approaches, such as word frequency statistics and probability-based analyses.
However, few have systematically examined the potential impact of LLMs on the
linguistic characteristics of academic writing. To address this gap, we
conducted a large-scale analysis across 823,798 abstracts published in last
decade from arXiv dataset. Through the linguistic analysis of features such as
the frequency of LLM-preferred words, lexical complexity, syntactic complexity,
cohesion, readability and sentiment, the results indicate a significant
increase in the proportion of LLM-preferred words in abstracts, revealing the
widespread influence of LLMs on academic writing. Additionally, we observed an
increase in lexical complexity and sentiment in the abstracts, but a decrease
in syntactic complexity, suggesting that LLMs introduce more new vocabulary and
simplify sentence structure. However, the significant decrease in cohesion and
readability indicates that abstracts have fewer connecting words and are
becoming more difficult to read. Moreover, our analysis reveals that scholars
with weaker English proficiency were more likely to use the LLMs for academic
writing, and focused on improving the overall logic and fluency of the
abstracts. Finally, at discipline level, we found that scholars in Computer
Science showed more pronounced changes in writing style, while the changes in
Mathematics were minimal.

Motivation: 少样本关系抽取（FSRE）因标注数据稀缺和现有模型泛化能力有限而具挑战性，大语言模型虽通过上下文学习展现潜力，但其通用目标导致任务性能不佳。

Method: TKRE框架利用大语言模型生成解释驱动的知识和模式约束的合成数据，并采用两阶段预训练策略（MSLM和SCL）增强关系推理和泛化能力。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，TKRE在少样本关系抽取中达到最新最优性能。

Conclusion: TKRE有效解决了FSRE任务，展示了在低资源场景中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Few-Shot Relation Extraction (FSRE) remains a challenging task due to the
scarcity of annotated data and the limited generalization capabilities of
existing models. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
potential in FSRE through in-context learning (ICL), their general-purpose
training objectives often result in suboptimal performance for task-specific
relation extraction. To overcome these challenges, we propose TKRE (Two-Stage
Knowledge-Guided Pre-training for Relation Extraction), a novel framework that
synergistically integrates LLMs with traditional relation extraction models,
bridging generative and discriminative learning paradigms. TKRE introduces two
key innovations: (1) leveraging LLMs to generate explanation-driven knowledge
and schema-constrained synthetic data, addressing the issue of data scarcity;
and (2) a two-stage pre-training strategy combining Masked Span Language
Modeling (MSLM) and Span-Level Contrastive Learning (SCL) to enhance relational
reasoning and generalization. Together, these components enable TKRE to
effectively tackle FSRE tasks. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate the efficacy of TKRE, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in
FSRE and underscoring its potential for broader application in low-resource
scenarios. \footnote{The code and data are released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM规模的扩大和实际应用的增加，其记忆敏感和PII数据的隐私风险日益突出，但缺乏全面、真实且符合伦理的数据集来研究这一问题。

Method: 通过构建内部一致的多属性合成人类档案，结合零样本提示和OpenAI o3-mini生成多样化的在线内容类型，嵌入真实的PII和敏感信息。

Result: 在Mistral-7B模型上验证了PANORAMA的实用性，发现PII记忆率随数据重复率增加而上升，且不同内容类型的记忆风险存在差异。

Conclusion: PANORAMA为隐私风险评估、模型审计和隐私保护LLM的开发提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The memorization of sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII)
by large language models (LLMs) poses growing privacy risks as models scale and
are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Existing efforts to study
sensitive and PII data memorization and develop mitigation strategies are
hampered by the absence of comprehensive, realistic, and ethically sourced
datasets reflecting the diversity of sensitive information found on the web. We
introduce PANORAMA - Profile-based Assemblage for Naturalistic Online
Representation and Attribute Memorization Analysis, a large-scale synthetic
corpus of 384,789 samples derived from 9,674 synthetic profiles designed to
closely emulate the distribution, variety, and context of PII and sensitive
data as it naturally occurs in online environments. Our data generation
pipeline begins with the construction of internally consistent, multi-attribute
human profiles using constrained selection to reflect real-world demographics
such as education, health attributes, financial status, etc. Using a
combination of zero-shot prompting and OpenAI o3-mini, we generate diverse
content types - including wiki-style articles, social media posts, forum
discussions, online reviews, comments, and marketplace listings - each
embedding realistic, contextually appropriate PII and other sensitive
information. We validate the utility of PANORAMA by fine-tuning the Mistral-7B
model on 1x, 5x, 10x, and 25x data replication rates with a subset of data and
measure PII memorization rates - revealing not only consistent increases with
repetition but also variation across content types, highlighting PANORAMA's
ability to model how memorization risks differ by context. Our dataset and code
are publicly available, providing a much-needed resource for privacy risk
assessment, model auditing, and the development of privacy-preserving LLMs.

Result: 发现低或高熵分布、含异常标记的分布以及由其他语言模型生成的分布更容易近似。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型的表达能力及其作为概率分布生成器的挑战。

Abstract: Autoregressive neural language models (LMs) generate a probability
distribution over tokens at each time step given a prompt. In this work, we
attempt to systematically understand the probability distributions that LMs can
produce, showing that some distributions are significantly harder to elicit
than others. Specifically, for any target next-token distribution over the
vocabulary, we attempt to find a prompt that induces the LM to output a
distribution as close as possible to the target, using either soft or hard
gradient-based prompt tuning. We find that (1) in general, distributions with
very low or very high entropy are easier to approximate than those with
moderate entropy; (2) among distributions with the same entropy, those
containing ''outlier tokens'' are easier to approximate; (3) target
distributions generated by LMs -- even LMs with different tokenizers -- are
easier to approximate than randomly chosen targets. These results offer
insights into the expressiveness of LMs and the challenges of using them as
probability distribution proposers.

Result: 实验显示EQUAL降低计算成本5-10倍，并在LLaMA-3.1-8B和Mistral-7B上提升准确率2.5%。

Conclusion: EQUAL为指令调优提供了一种高效且可扩展的数据提取方法。

Abstract: Instruction tuning improves the performance of large language models (LLMs),
but it heavily relies on high-quality training data. Recently, LLMs have been
used to synthesize instruction data using seed question-answer (QA) pairs.
However, these synthesized instructions often lack diversity and tend to be
similar to the input seeds, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address this, we propose extracting instruction tuning data from
web corpora that contain rich and diverse knowledge. A naive solution is to
retrieve domain-specific documents and extract all QA pairs from them, but this
faces two key challenges: (1) extracting all QA pairs using LLMs is
prohibitively expensive, and (2) many extracted QA pairs may be irrelevant to
the downstream tasks, potentially degrading model performance. To tackle these
issues, we introduce EQUAL, an effective and scalable data extraction framework
that iteratively alternates between document selection and high-quality QA pair
extraction to enhance instruction tuning. EQUAL first clusters the document
corpus based on embeddings derived from contrastive learning, then uses a
multi-armed bandit strategy to efficiently identify clusters that are likely to
contain valuable QA pairs. This iterative approach significantly reduces
computational cost while boosting model performance. Experiments on
AutoMathText and StackOverflow across four downstream tasks show that EQUAL
reduces computational costs by 5-10x and improves accuracy by 2.5 percent on
LLaMA-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B

Conclusion: Teach2Eval避免了数据泄漏和记忆问题，能更全面地评估LLM的认知能力。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the development
of effective evaluation methods. Traditional benchmarks rely on task-specific
metrics and static datasets, which often suffer from fairness issues, limited
scalability, and contamination risks. In this paper, we introduce Teach2Eval,
an indirect evaluation framework inspired by the Feynman Technique. Instead of
directly testing LLMs on predefined tasks, our method evaluates a model's
multiple abilities to teach weaker student models to perform tasks effectively.
By converting open-ended tasks into standardized multiple-choice questions
(MCQs) through teacher-generated feedback, Teach2Eval enables scalable,
automated, and multi-dimensional assessment. Our approach not only avoids data
leakage and memorization but also captures a broad range of cognitive abilities
that are orthogonal to current benchmarks. Experimental results across 26
leading LLMs show strong alignment with existing human and model-based dynamic
rankings, while offering additional interpretability for training guidance.

Result: 实验表明，RATE-FT比普通微调方法在LongFact数据集上提升了3%的准确性，具有广泛适用性。

Conclusion: RATE-FT是一种有效的幻觉检测方法，尤其适用于开放域长文本生成任务。

Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of factually incorrect information, remains a
significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), especially in
open-domain long-form generation. Existing approaches for detecting
hallucination in long-form tasks either focus on limited domains or rely
heavily on external fact-checking tools, which may not always be available.
  In this work, we systematically investigate reference-free hallucination
detection in open-domain long-form responses. Our findings reveal that internal
states (e.g., model's output probability and entropy) alone are insufficient
for reliably (i.e., better than random guessing) distinguishing between factual
and hallucinated content. To enhance detection, we explore various existing
approaches, including prompting-based methods, probing, and fine-tuning, with
fine-tuning proving the most effective. To further improve the accuracy, we
introduce a new paradigm, named RATE-FT, that augments fine-tuning with an
auxiliary task for the model to jointly learn with the main task of
hallucination detection. With extensive experiments and analysis using a
variety of model families & datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method, e.g., +3% over general fine-tuning methods on
LongFact.

Conclusion: 语法和数值能力源于部分可重用的专用头电路，每个任务有独立的“超级头”。

Abstract: Understanding which neural components drive specific capabilities in
mid-sized language models ($\leq$10B parameters) remains a key challenge. We
introduce the $(\bm{K}, \epsilon)$-Minimum Sufficient Head Circuit ($K$-MSHC),
a methodology to identify minimal sets of attention heads crucial for
classification tasks as well as Search-K-MSHC, an efficient algorithm for
discovering these circuits. Applying our Search-K-MSHC algorithm to Gemma-9B,
we analyze three syntactic task families: grammar acceptability, arithmetic
verification, and arithmetic word problems. Our findings reveal distinct
task-specific head circuits, with grammar tasks predominantly utilizing early
layers, word problems showing pronounced activity in both shallow and deep
regions, and arithmetic verification demonstrating a more distributed pattern
across the network. We discover non-linear circuit overlap patterns, where
different task pairs share computational components at varying levels of
importance. While grammar and arithmetic share many "weak" heads, arithmetic
and word problems share more consistently critical "strong" heads. Importantly,
we find that each task maintains dedicated "super-heads" with minimal
cross-task overlap, suggesting that syntactic and numerical competencies emerge
from specialized yet partially reusable head circuits.

Conclusion: 方言指导的框架显著提升了低资源语言机器翻译评估的效果，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) for low-resource languages poses a
persistent challenge, primarily due to the limited availability of high quality
reference translations. This issue is further exacerbated in languages with
multiple dialects, where linguistic diversity and data scarcity hinder robust
evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising solution through
reference-free evaluation techniques; however, their effectiveness diminishes
in the absence of dialect-specific context and tailored guidance. In this work,
we propose a comprehensive framework that enhances LLM-based MT evaluation
using a dialect guided approach. We extend the ONUBAD dataset by incorporating
Sylheti-English sentence pairs, corresponding machine translations, and Direct
Assessment (DA) scores annotated by native speakers. To address the vocabulary
gap, we augment the tokenizer vocabulary with dialect-specific terms. We
further introduce a regression head to enable scalar score prediction and
design a dialect-guided (DG) prompting strategy. Our evaluation across multiple
LLMs shows that the proposed pipeline consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving the highest gain of +0.1083 in Spearman correlation, along
with improvements across other evaluation settings. The dataset and the code

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread applications across various
domains, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial prompt injections. While most
existing research on jailbreak attacks and hallucination phenomena has focused
primarily on open-source models, we investigate the frontier of closed-source
LLMs under multilingual attack scenarios. We present a first-of-its-kind
integrated adversarial framework that leverages diverse attack techniques to
systematically evaluate frontier proprietary solutions, including GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-R1, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and Qwen-Max. Our evaluation spans six categories
of security contents in both English and Chinese, generating 38,400 responses
across 32 types of jailbreak attacks. Attack success rate (ASR) is utilized as
the quantitative metric to assess performance from three dimensions: prompt
design, model architecture, and language environment. Our findings suggest that
Qwen-Max is the most vulnerable, while GPT-4o shows the strongest defense.
Notably, prompts in Chinese consistently yield higher ASRs than their English
counterparts, and our novel Two-Sides attack technique proves to be the most
effective across all models. This work highlights a dire need for
language-aware alignment and robust cross-lingual defenses in LLMs, and we hope
it will inspire researchers, developers, and policymakers toward more robust

Abstract: The Chain of Action-Planning Thoughts (CoaT) paradigm has been shown to
improve the reasoning performance of VLM-based mobile agents in GUI tasks.
However, the scarcity of diverse CoaT trajectories limits the expressiveness
and generalization ability of such agents. While self-training is commonly
employed to address data scarcity, existing approaches either overlook the
correctness of intermediate reasoning steps or depend on expensive
process-level annotations to construct process reward models (PRM). To address
the above problems, we propose an Iterative Preference Learning (IPL) that
constructs a CoaT-tree through interative sampling, scores leaf nodes using
rule-based reward, and backpropagates feedback to derive Thinking-level Direct
Preference Optimization (T-DPO) pairs. To prevent overfitting during warm-up
supervised fine-tuning, we further introduce a three-stage instruction
evolution, which leverages GPT-4o to generate diverse Q\&A pairs based on real
mobile UI screenshots, enhancing both generality and layout understanding.
Experiments on three standard Mobile GUI-agent benchmarks demonstrate that our
agent MobileIPL outperforms strong baselines, including continual pretraining
models such as OS-ATLAS and UI-TARS. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three standard Mobile GUI-Agents benchmarks and shows strong
generalization to out-of-domain scenarios.

### [75] [HBO: Hierarchical Balancing Optimization for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12300)
*Weixuan Wang,Minghao Wu,Barry Haddow,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Hierarchical Balancing Optimization (HBO)的新方法，通过全局和局部两级优化解决LLM微调中的数据不平衡和异质性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注全局数据平衡，忽略了局部数据集内部的不平衡和异质性，限制了微调效果。

Method: HBO采用双层优化策略，包括全局Actor平衡跨数据集采样和多个局部Actor优化子集内数据使用。

Result: 在九个多语言和多任务实验中，HBO显著优于基线方法，准确率提升明显。

Conclusion: HBO为LLM微调中的数据不平衡和异质性问题提供了全面解决方案，提升了训练效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on a mixture of diverse datasets
poses challenges due to data imbalance and heterogeneity. Existing methods
often address these issues across datasets (globally) but overlook the
imbalance and heterogeneity within individual datasets (locally), which limits
their effectiveness. We introduce Hierarchical Balancing Optimization (HBO), a
novel method that enables LLMs to autonomously adjust data allocation during
fine-tuning both across datasets (globally) and within each individual dataset
(locally). HBO employs a bilevel optimization strategy with two types of
actors: a Global Actor, which balances data sampling across different subsets
of the training mixture, and several Local Actors, which optimizes data usage
within each subset based on difficulty levels. These actors are guided by
reward functions derived from the LLM's training state, which measure learning
progress and relative performance improvement. We evaluate HBO on three LLM
backbones across nine diverse tasks in multilingual and multitask setups.
Results show that HBO consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving
significant accuracy gains. Our in-depth analysis further demonstrates that
both the global actor and local actors of HBO effectively adjust data usage
during fine-tuning. HBO provides a comprehensive solution to the challenges of
data imbalance and heterogeneity in LLM fine-tuning, enabling more effective
training across diverse datasets.

*Yuwei Zhang,Wenhao Yu,Shangbin Feng,Yifan Zhu,Letian Peng,Jayanth Srinivasa,Gaowen Liu,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了WikiDYK，一个基于Wikipedia动态更新的知识注入基准，用于测试大语言模型的知识记忆能力。实验发现因果语言模型（CLMs）表现不如双向语言模型（BiLMs），并提出了一种模块化协作框架提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型的知识记忆能力缺乏标准化、高质量的测试基准，因此需要一种动态更新的评估方法。

Method: 利用Wikipedia的“Did You Know...”条目构建WikiDYK基准，包含多种任务格式的问题-答案对，并通过持续预训练和模块化协作框架（BiLMs集成）进行实验。

Result: CLMs的知识记忆能力比BiLMs弱23%，而提出的协作框架将可靠性准确率提升至29.1%。

Conclusion: WikiDYK为评估语言模型知识记忆能力提供了动态基准，同时模块化协作框架显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs), their knowledge
memorization capabilities remain underexplored, due to the lack of standardized
and high-quality test ground. In this paper, we introduce a novel, real-world
and large-scale knowledge injection benchmark that evolves continuously over
time without requiring human intervention. Specifically, we propose WikiDYK,
which leverages recently-added and human-written facts from Wikipedia's "Did
You Know..." entries. These entries are carefully selected by expert Wikipedia
editors based on criteria such as verifiability and clarity. Each entry is
converted into multiple question-answer pairs spanning diverse task formats
from easy cloze prompts to complex multi-hop questions. WikiDYK contains 12,290
facts and 77,180 questions, which is also seamlessly extensible with future
updates from Wikipedia editors. Extensive experiments using continued
pre-training reveal a surprising insight: despite their prevalence in modern
LLMs, Causal Language Models (CLMs) demonstrate significantly weaker knowledge
memorization capabilities compared to Bidirectional Language Models (BiLMs),
exhibiting a 23% lower accuracy in terms of reliability. To compensate for the
smaller scales of current BiLMs, we introduce a modular collaborative framework
utilizing ensembles of BiLMs as external knowledge repositories to integrate
with LLMs. Experiment shows that our framework further improves the reliability
accuracy by up to 29.1%.

*Weixuan Wang,Minghao Wu,Barry Haddow,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: ExpertSteer是一种新方法，利用外部专家模型生成引导向量，以控制大型语言模型（LLMs）的生成行为，显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多种任务中表现优异，但在推理过程中引导其行为仍具挑战性。现有方法依赖模型自身生成引导向量，限制了效果和灵活性。

Method: ExpertSteer通过四步流程实现：1) 使用自编码器对齐表示维度；2) 基于互信息分析确定干预层对；3) 利用递归特征机生成引导向量；4) 在推理时应用这些向量。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，ExpertSteer显著优于现有方法，且成本极低。

Conclusion: ExpertSteer提供了一种高效、灵活的方法，利用外部专家模型控制LLMs的行为，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across various
tasks, yet guiding them to follow desired behaviours during inference remains a
significant challenge. Activation steering offers a promising method to control
the generation process of LLMs by modifying their internal activations.
However, existing methods commonly intervene in the model's behaviour using
steering vectors generated by the model itself, which constrains their
effectiveness to that specific model and excludes the possibility of leveraging
powerful external expert models for steering. To address these limitations, we
propose ExpertSteer, a novel approach that leverages arbitrary specialized
expert models to generate steering vectors, enabling intervention in any LLMs.
ExpertSteer transfers the knowledge from an expert model to a target LLM
through a cohesive four-step process: first aligning representation dimensions
with auto-encoders to enable cross-model transfer, then identifying
intervention layer pairs based on mutual information analysis, next generating
steering vectors from the expert model using Recursive Feature Machines, and
finally applying these vectors on the identified layers during inference to
selectively guide the target LLM without updating model parameters. We conduct
comprehensive experiments using three LLMs on 15 popular benchmarks across four
distinct domains. Experiments demonstrate that ExpertSteer significantly
outperforms established baselines across diverse tasks at minimal cost.

Result: 无需微调、外部检索或集成，方法整体排名第5，性能与更复杂、资源消耗更大的方法相当。

Conclusion: 分析了方法的优势和局限性，并提出了未来在LLM结构化推理研究方向。

Abstract: We present Team asdfo123's submission to the LLMSR@XLLM25 shared task, which
evaluates large language models on producing fine-grained, controllable, and
interpretable reasoning processes. Systems must extract all problem conditions,
decompose a chain of thought into statement-evidence pairs, and verify the
logical validity of each pair. Leveraging only the off-the-shelf
Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, we craft a concise few-shot, multi-turn prompt that
first enumerates all conditions and then guides the model to label, cite, and
adjudicate every reasoning step. A lightweight post-processor based on regular
expressions normalises spans and enforces the official JSON schema. Without
fine-tuning, external retrieval, or ensembling, our method ranks 5th overall,
achieving macro F1 scores on par with substantially more complex and
resource-consuming pipelines. We conclude by analysing the strengths and
limitations of our approach and outlining directions for future research in
structural reasoning with LLMs. Our code is available at

TLDR: UniEdit是一个基于开放领域知识的统一基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）编辑的准确性和可靠性，覆盖广泛的知识领域和编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM编辑数据集局限于狭窄知识领域，缺乏对编辑需求广度和编辑后连锁效应的全面评估。

Method: 通过开放领域知识图谱构建编辑样本，设计NMCS算法采样子图以评估编辑的连锁效应，并利用专有LLM将子图转换为自然语言文本。

Result: UniEdit基准在规模、全面性和多样性上表现优异，实验揭示了不同LLM和编辑器的性能特点。

Conclusion: UniEdit为未来研究提供了开放知识领域编辑的宝贵见解。

Abstract: Model editing aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large language
models (LLMs) by efficiently adjusting their internal parameters. Currently,
most LLM editing datasets are confined to narrow knowledge domains and cover a
limited range of editing evaluation. They often overlook the broad scope of
editing demands and the diversity of ripple effects resulting from edits. In
this context, we introduce UniEdit, a unified benchmark for LLM editing
grounded in open-domain knowledge. First, we construct editing samples by
selecting entities from 25 common domains across five major categories,
utilizing the extensive triple knowledge available in open-domain knowledge
graphs to ensure comprehensive coverage of the knowledge domains. To address
the issues of generality and locality in editing, we design an Neighborhood
Multi-hop Chain Sampling (NMCS) algorithm to sample subgraphs based on a given
knowledge piece to entail comprehensive ripple effects to evaluate. Finally, we
employ proprietary LLMs to convert the sampled knowledge subgraphs into natural
language text, guaranteeing grammatical accuracy and syntactical diversity.
Extensive statistical analysis confirms the scale, comprehensiveness, and
diversity of our UniEdit benchmark. We conduct comprehensive experiments across
multiple LLMs and editors, analyzing their performance to highlight strengths
and weaknesses in editing across open knowledge domains and various evaluation
criteria, thereby offering valuable insights for future research endeavors.

TLDR: 研究发现大语言模型（LLM）会反映训练数据中的偏见，提出通过群体策略（如加权聚合和混合群体）来缓解偏见并提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在性能优异的同时可能无意中放大训练数据中的偏见，需探索有效方法减少偏见。

Method: 分析LLM对偏见诱导标题的响应，尝试群体策略（平均聚合、加权聚合）和混合群体（LLM与人类）。

Result: 加权聚合比平均聚合更有效减少偏见；混合群体进一步降低偏见并提升性能。

Conclusion: 加权聚合和混合群体是减少LLM偏见的有效策略，尤其适用于种族和性别相关场景。

Abstract: Despite their performance, large language models (LLMs) can inadvertently
perpetuate biases found in the data they are trained on. By analyzing LLM
responses to bias-eliciting headlines, we find that these models often mirror
human biases. To address this, we explore crowd-based strategies for mitigating
bias through response aggregation. We first demonstrate that simply averaging
responses from multiple LLMs, intended to leverage the "wisdom of the crowd",
can exacerbate existing biases due to the limited diversity within LLM crowds.
In contrast, we show that locally weighted aggregation methods more effectively
leverage the wisdom of the LLM crowd, achieving both bias mitigation and
improved accuracy. Finally, recognizing the complementary strengths of LLMs
(accuracy) and humans (diversity), we demonstrate that hybrid crowds containing
both significantly enhance performance and further reduce biases across ethnic
and gender-related contexts.

Motivation: 提示注入是大型语言模型的主要安全风险，现有防护模型在上下文感知环境中的效果和过度防御倾向尚未充分研究。

Method: 引入CAPTURE基准测试，通过少量域内示例评估攻击检测和过度防御倾向。

Result: 实验显示现有防护模型在对抗性案例中漏检率高，在良性场景中误报率高。

Conclusion: 当前提示注入防护模型存在显著局限性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Prompt injection remains a major security risk for large language models.
However, the efficacy of existing guardrail models in context-aware settings
remains underexplored, as they often rely on static attack benchmarks.
Additionally, they have over-defense tendencies. We introduce CAPTURE, a novel
context-aware benchmark assessing both attack detection and over-defense
tendencies with minimal in-domain examples. Our experiments reveal that current
prompt injection guardrail models suffer from high false negatives in

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于比较行为理论的方法，研究语言模型中数据与架构对偏见传播的交互作用，发现数据时间性、模型架构（如n-gram与Transformer）对偏见传播有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于语言模型偏见的研究多关注数据质量，而忽视了模型架构和时间因素，且缺乏对偏见起源的系统性研究。

Method: 采用比较行为理论方法，结合n-gram与Transformer架构，分析数据、模型设计及时间动态对偏见传播的影响。

Result: 发现n-gram模型对上下文窗口大小敏感，Transformer架构更稳健；数据时间性显著影响偏见；不同架构对偏见注入反应不同，某些偏见（如性取向）被放大。

Conclusion: 需从数据和模型维度全面追溯偏见起源，而非仅关注表象，以减少语言模型的潜在危害。

Abstract: Current research on bias in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
data quality, with significantly less attention paid to model architecture and
temporal influences of data. Even more critically, few studies systematically
investigate the origins of bias. We propose a methodology grounded in
comparative behavioral theory to interpret the complex interaction between
training data and model architecture in bias propagation during language
modeling. Building on recent work that relates transformers to n-gram LMs, we
evaluate how data, model design choices, and temporal dynamics affect bias
propagation. Our findings reveal that: (1) n-gram LMs are highly sensitive to
context window size in bias propagation, while transformers demonstrate
architectural robustness; (2) the temporal provenance of training data
significantly affects bias; and (3) different model architectures respond
differentially to controlled bias injection, with certain biases (e.g. sexual
orientation) being disproportionately amplified. As language models become
ubiquitous, our findings highlight the need for a holistic approach -- tracing
bias to its origins across both data and model dimensions, not just symptoms,
to mitigate harm.

TLDR: SLOT是一种参数高效的测试时推理方法，通过少量优化步骤更新样本特定参数向量，提升语言模型对复杂指令的响应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在处理复杂指令时表现不佳，SLOT旨在通过测试时优化提升模型对个别提示的适应能力。

Method: SLOT在测试时进行少量优化步骤，更新轻量级样本特定参数向量，并将其添加到最终隐藏层前，通过缓存最后一层特征实现高效适应。

Result: 实验表明，SLOT在多个基准测试和模型上表现优异，例如Qwen2.5-7B在GSM8K上准确率提升8.6%，DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B在GPQA上达到68.69%的SOTA准确率。

Conclusion: SLOT通过测试时优化显著提升语言模型对复杂指令的响应能力，具有高效性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: We propose SLOT (Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time), a
novel and parameter-efficient test-time inference approach that enhances a
language model's ability to more accurately respond to individual prompts.
Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex instructions,
leading to poor performances on those not well represented among general
samples. To address this, SLOT conducts few optimization steps at test-time to
update a light-weight sample-specific parameter vector. It is added to the
final hidden layer before the output head, and enables efficient adaptation by
caching the last layer features during per-sample optimization. By minimizing
the cross-entropy loss on the input prompt only, SLOT helps the model better
aligned with and follow each given instruction. In experiments, we demonstrate
that our method outperforms the compared models across multiple benchmarks and
LLMs. For example, Qwen2.5-7B with SLOT achieves an accuracy gain of 8.6% on
GSM8K from 57.54% to 66.19%, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B with SLOT
achieves a SOTA accuracy of 68.69% on GPQA among 70B-level models. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码框架依赖逐层验证机制，导致接受长度不足和候选序列利用效率低下。

Method: 采用从叶到根的遍历验证方式，考虑整个序列的接受概率，保留潜在有效子序列。

Result: 理论证明Traversal Verification与目标模型的概率分布一致，实验显示其接受长度和吞吐量均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Traversal Verification是一种无损推理的推测解码算法，显著提升了大型语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a promising approach for accelerating large language
models. The primary idea is to use a lightweight draft model to speculate the
output of the target model for multiple subsequent timesteps, and then verify
them in parallel to determine whether the drafted tokens should be accepted or
rejected. To enhance acceptance rates, existing frameworks typically construct
token trees containing multiple candidates in each timestep. However, their
reliance on token-level verification mechanisms introduces two critical
limitations: First, the probability distribution of a sequence differs from
that of individual tokens, leading to suboptimal acceptance length. Second,
current verification schemes begin from the root node and proceed layer by
layer in a top-down manner. Once a parent node is rejected, all its child nodes
should be discarded, resulting in inefficient utilization of speculative
candidates. This paper introduces Traversal Verification, a novel speculative
decoding algorithm that fundamentally rethinks the verification paradigm
through leaf-to-root traversal. Our approach considers the acceptance of the
entire token sequence from the current node to the root, and preserves
potentially valid subsequences that would be prematurely discarded by existing
methods. We theoretically prove that the probability distribution obtained
through Traversal Verification is identical to that of the target model,
guaranteeing lossless inference while achieving substantial acceleration gains.
Experimental results across different large language models and multiple tasks
show that our method consistently improves acceptance length and throughput
over existing methods

Conclusion: Table-R1和TARPO显著提升了语言模型在表格推理中的效率和性能，优于更大参数的基线模型。

Abstract: Tables present unique challenges for language models due to their structured
row-column interactions, necessitating specialized approaches for effective
comprehension. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential
in table reasoning through prompting and techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT)
and program-of-thought (PoT), optimizing their performance for table question
answering remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce region-based
Table-R1, a novel reinforcement learning approach that enhances LLM table
understanding by integrating region evidence into reasoning steps. Our method
employs Region-Enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (RE-SFT) to guide models in
identifying relevant table regions before generating answers, incorporating
textual, symbolic, and program-based reasoning. Additionally, Table-Aware Group
Relative Policy Optimization (TARPO) introduces a mixed reward system to
dynamically balance region accuracy and answer correctness, with decaying
region rewards and consistency penalties to align reasoning steps. Experiments
show that Table-R1 achieves an average performance improvement of 14.36 points
across multiple base models on three benchmark datasets, even outperforming
baseline models with ten times the parameters, while TARPO reduces response
token consumption by 67.5% compared to GRPO, significantly advancing LLM
capabilities in efficient tabular reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预定义RoPE的基础频率时难以找到最优因子，导致性能受限。PSC旨在通过校准频率提升现有方法的性能。

Method: 引入PSC模块，对现有方法（如PI、YaRN、LongRoPE）预定义的频率进行校准。

Result: 实验表明，启用PSC后，随着上下文窗口从16k扩展到64k，困惑度显著降低；PSC具有广泛的适用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PSC是一种有效且通用的频率校准方法，能够显著提升RoPE在扩展上下文窗口时的性能。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is an efficient position encoding approach
and is widely utilized in numerous large language models (LLMs). Recently, a
lot of methods have been put forward to further expand the context window based
on RoPE. The core concept of those methods is to predefine or search for a set
of factors to rescale the base frequencies of RoPE. Nevertheless, it is quite a
challenge for existing methods to predefine an optimal factor due to the
exponential search space. In view of this, we introduce PSC (Phase Shift
Calibration), a small module for calibrating the frequencies predefined by
existing methods. With the employment of PSC, we demonstrate that many existing
methods can be further enhanced, like PI, YaRN, and LongRoPE. We conducted
extensive experiments across multiple models and tasks. The results demonstrate
that (1) when PSC is enabled, the comparative reductions in perplexity increase
as the context window size is varied from 16k, to 32k, and up to 64k. (2) Our
approach is broadly applicable and exhibits robustness across a variety of
models and tasks. The code can be found at https://github.com/WNQzhu/PSC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注任务性能指标，忽视了人类对叙事和游戏逻辑的理解，因此需要一种更接近人类行为的框架。

Method: LPLH框架包含三个关键组件：结构化地图构建、动作学习和反馈驱动的经验分析。

Result: LPLH能够生成更可解释、更接近人类行为的游戏表现，超越了纯探索性策略。

Conclusion: LPLH为大型语言模型在复杂文本环境中的游戏学习提供了新路径，强调上下文感知和常识约束。

Abstract: Interactive Fiction games (IF games) are where players interact through
natural language commands. While recent advances in Artificial Intelligence
agents have reignited interest in IF games as a domain for studying
decision-making, existing approaches prioritize task-specific performance
metrics over human-like comprehension of narrative context and gameplay logic.
This work presents a cognitively inspired framework that guides Large Language
Models (LLMs) to learn and play IF games systematically. Our proposed
**L**earning to **P**lay **L**ike **H**umans (LPLH) framework integrates three
key components: (1) structured map building to capture spatial and narrative
relationships, (2) action learning to identify context-appropriate commands,
and (3) feedback-driven experience analysis to refine decision-making over
time. By aligning LLMs-based agents' behavior with narrative intent and
commonsense constraints, LPLH moves beyond purely exploratory strategies to
deliver more interpretable, human-like performance. Crucially, this approach
draws on cognitive science principles to more closely simulate how human
players read, interpret, and respond within narrative worlds. As a result, LPLH
reframes the IF games challenge as a learning problem for LLMs-based agents,
offering a new path toward robust, context-aware gameplay in complex text-based
environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly demonstrate signs of conceptual
understanding, yet much of their internal knowledge remains latent, loosely
structured, and difficult to access or evaluate. We propose self-questioning as
a lightweight and scalable strategy to improve LLMs' understanding,
particularly in domains where success depends on fine-grained semantic
distinctions. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a challenging new
benchmark of 1.3 million post-2015 computer science patent pairs, characterized
by dense technical jargon and strategically complex writing. The benchmark
centers on a pairwise differentiation task: can a model distinguish between
closely related but substantively different inventions? We show that prompting
LLMs to generate and answer their own questions - targeting the background
knowledge required for the task - significantly improves performance. These
self-generated questions and answers activate otherwise underutilized internal
knowledge. Allowing LLMs to retrieve answers from external scientific texts
further enhances performance, suggesting that model knowledge is compressed and
lacks the full richness of the training data. We also find that
chain-of-thought prompting and self-questioning converge, though
self-questioning remains more effective for improving understanding of
technical concepts. Notably, we uncover an asymmetry in prompting: smaller
models often generate more fundamental, more open-ended, better-aligned
questions for mid-sized models than large models with better understanding do,
revealing a new strategy for cross-model collaboration. Altogether, our
findings establish self-questioning as both a practical mechanism for
automatically improving LLM comprehension, especially in domains with sparse
and underrepresented knowledge, and a diagnostic probe of how internal and
external knowledge are organized.

TLDR: 本文探讨了远程监督命名实体识别（DS-NER）的有效性和鲁棒性，通过分析不同远程标注方法的潜在噪声分布，并提出了一种新的噪声评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程监督NER是一种低成本、便捷的替代人工标注的方法，但不同远程标注方法之间的噪声分布尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 研究从两个方面展开：(1) 远程标注技术（包括传统规则方法和创新的大语言模型监督方法）；(2) 噪声评估，提出新框架，将问题分为未标记实体问题（UEP）和噪声实体问题（NEP），并为每个问题提供专门解决方案。

Result: 在八个真实世界远程监督数据集上取得显著改进，涉及三种数据源和四种标注技术，优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在DS-NER中表现出优越性，为噪声分布问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Distantly supervised named entity recognition (DS-NER) has emerged as a cheap
and convenient alternative to traditional human annotation methods, enabling
the automatic generation of training data by aligning text with external
resources. Despite the many efforts in noise measurement methods, few works
focus on the latent noise distribution between different distant annotation
methods. In this work, we explore the effectiveness and robustness of DS-NER by
two aspects: (1) distant annotation techniques, which encompasses both
traditional rule-based methods and the innovative large language model
supervision approach, and (2) noise assessment, for which we introduce a novel
framework. This framework addresses the challenges by distinctly categorizing
them into the unlabeled-entity problem (UEP) and the noisy-entity problem
(NEP), subsequently providing specialized solutions for each. Our proposed
method achieves significant improvements on eight real-world distant
supervision datasets originating from three different data sources and
involving four distinct annotation techniques, confirming its superiority over
current state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 将任务输出建模为背景和观点摘要，定义两种标准化摘要模式，并引入首个高质量人工标注基准及分层评估框架。

Result: 评估12种LLMs发现：1) LLMs在背景摘要检索与观点整合上表现不佳；2) 即使顶级LLMs平均表现不足69%；3) 当前LLMs缺乏足够的自我评估与修正能力。

Conclusion: LLMs在新任务中表现有限，需进一步改进背景知识整合与自我修正能力。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the performance of LLMs on a new task that
requires combining discussion with background knowledge for summarization. This
aims to address the limitation of outside observer confusion in existing
dialogue summarization systems due to their reliance solely on discussion
information. To achieve this, we model the task output as background and
opinion summaries and define two standardized summarization patterns. To
support assessment, we introduce the first benchmark comprising high-quality
samples consistently annotated by human experts and propose a novel
hierarchical evaluation framework with fine-grained, interpretable metrics. We
evaluate 12 LLMs under structured-prompt and self-reflection paradigms. Our
findings reveal: (1) LLMs struggle with background summary retrieval,
generation, and opinion summary integration. (2) Even top LLMs achieve less
than 69% average performance across both patterns. (3) Current LLMs lack
adequate self-evaluation and self-correction capabilities for this task.

Motivation: 现有基于LLMs的KGQA方法忽视历史推理路径的利用，且复杂语义可能导致检索不准确的推理路径。

Method: RTSoG将问题分解为子问题，采用奖励引导的SC-MCTS迭代检索加权推理路径，并基于权重生成最终答案。

Result: 在四个数据集上验证了RTSoG的有效性，在GrailQA和WebQSP上分别提升了8.7%和7.0%。

Conclusion: RTSoG通过结合子问题分解和奖励引导的树搜索，显著提升了KGQA任务的性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) tasks, which aim to
find answers based on knowledge graphs (KGs) for natural language questions.
Existing LLMs-based KGQA methods typically follow the Graph Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (GraphRAG) paradigm, which first retrieves reasoning paths from the
large KGs, and then generates the answers based on them. However, these methods
emphasize the exploration of new optimal reasoning paths in KGs while ignoring
the exploitation of historical reasoning paths, which may lead to sub-optimal
reasoning paths. Additionally, the complex semantics contained in questions may
lead to the retrieval of inaccurate reasoning paths. To address these issues,
this paper proposes a novel and training-free framework for KGQA tasks called
Reward-guided Tree Search on Graph (RTSoG). RTSoG decomposes an original
question into a series of simpler and well-defined sub-questions to handle the
complex semantics. Then, a Self-Critic Monte Carlo Tree Search (SC-MCTS) guided
by a reward model is introduced to iteratively retrieve weighted reasoning
paths as contextual knowledge. Finally, it stacks the weighted reasoning paths
according to their weights to generate the final answers. Extensive experiments
on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RTSoG. Notably, it achieves
8.7\% and 7.0\% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the
GrailQA and the WebQSP respectively.

Motivation: 现代语言模型上下文长度增加，需评估其在长文档中的信息检索与处理能力，现有基准缺乏系统化问题复杂度变化。

Method: 利用知识图谱提取多复杂度QA对，基于财务协议结构化表示，聚焦多跳检索、集合操作和答案多样性。

Result: 构建20,139对QA数据集（长上下文基准中最大），评估13种模型，发现其在集合比较和多跳推理上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 模型在语义误解和隐式关系处理上存在系统性失败模式。

Abstract: The increasing context length of modern language models has created a need
for evaluating their ability to retrieve and process information across
extensive documents. While existing benchmarks test long-context capabilities,
they often lack a structured way to systematically vary question complexity. We
introduce KG-QAGen (Knowledge-Graph-based Question-Answer Generation), a
framework that (1) extracts QA pairs at multiple complexity levels (2) by
leveraging structured representations of financial agreements (3) along three
key dimensions -- multi-hop retrieval, set operations, and answer plurality --
enabling fine-grained assessment of model performance across controlled
difficulty levels. Using this framework, we construct a dataset of 20,139 QA
pairs (the largest number among the long-context benchmarks) and open-source a
part of it. We evaluate 13 proprietary and open-source LLMs and observe that
even the best-performing models are struggling with set-based comparisons and
multi-hop logical inference. Our analysis reveals systematic failure modes tied
to semantic misinterpretation and inability to handle implicit relations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成自然文本的能力引发了作者身份认证的挑战，现有检测方法的可解释性不足。

Method: LM$^2$otifs将文本转化为词共现图，利用图神经网络进行预测，并通过后处理提取可解释的语义模式。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，提取的模式能有效区分MGT和HGT。

Conclusion: LM$^2$otifs不仅性能优越，还能提供多层次的解释，揭示了MGT的独特语言特征。

Abstract: The impressive ability of large language models to generate natural text
across various tasks has led to critical challenges in authorship
authentication. Although numerous detection methods have been developed to
differentiate between machine-generated texts (MGT) and human-generated texts
(HGT), the explainability of these methods remains a significant gap.
Traditional explainability techniques often fall short in capturing the complex
word relationships that distinguish HGT from MGT. To address this limitation,
we present LM$^2$otifs, a novel explainable framework for MGT detection.
Inspired by probabilistic graphical models, we provide a theoretical rationale
for the effectiveness. LM$^2$otifs utilizes eXplainable Graph Neural Networks
to achieve both accurate detection and interpretability. The LM$^2$otifs
pipeline operates in three key stages: first, it transforms text into graphs
based on word co-occurrence to represent lexical dependencies; second, graph
neural networks are used for prediction; and third, a post-hoc explainability
method extracts interpretable motifs, offering multi-level explanations from
individual words to sentence structures. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the comparable performance of LM$^2$otifs. The
empirical evaluation of the extracted explainable motifs confirms their
effectiveness in differentiating HGT and MGT. Furthermore, qualitative analysis
reveals distinct and visible linguistic fingerprints characteristic of MGT.

Result: 在PRIDE数据集上达到61.47%的恢复率，并展示了与多种生物伙伴的预测能力。

Conclusion: DS-ProGen通过多模态结构编码，实现了功能性和结构稳定性的双重优势。

Abstract: Inverse Protein Folding (IPF) is a critical subtask in the field of protein
design, aiming to engineer amino acid sequences capable of folding correctly
into a specified three-dimensional (3D) conformation. Although substantial
progress has been achieved in recent years, existing methods generally rely on
either backbone coordinates or molecular surface features alone, which
restricts their ability to fully capture the complex chemical and geometric
constraints necessary for precise sequence prediction. To address this
limitation, we present DS-ProGen, a dual-structure deep language model for
functional protein design, which integrates both backbone geometry and
surface-level representations. By incorporating backbone coordinates as well as
surface chemical and geometric descriptors into a next-amino-acid prediction
paradigm, DS-ProGen is able to generate functionally relevant and structurally
stable sequences while satisfying both global and local conformational
constraints. On the PRIDE dataset, DS-ProGen attains the current
state-of-the-art recovery rate of 61.47%, demonstrating the synergistic
advantage of multi-modal structural encoding in protein design. Furthermore,
DS-ProGen excels in predicting interactions with a variety of biological
partners, including ligands, ions, and RNA, confirming its robust functional
retention capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly power mental-health chatbots, yet
the field still lacks a scalable, theory-grounded way to decide which model is
most effective to deploy. We present ESC-Judge, the first end-to-end evaluation
framework that (i) grounds head-to-head comparisons of emotional-support LLMs
in Clara Hill's established Exploration-Insight-Action counseling model,
providing a structured and interpretable view of performance, and (ii) fully
automates the evaluation pipeline at scale. ESC-Judge operates in three stages:
first, it synthesizes realistic help-seeker roles by sampling empirically
salient attributes such as stressors, personality, and life history; second, it
has two candidate support agents conduct separate sessions with the same role,
isolating model-specific strategies; and third, it asks a specialized judge LLM
to express pairwise preferences across rubric-anchored skills that span the
Exploration, Insight, and Action spectrum. In our study, ESC-Judge matched
PhD-level annotators on 85 percent of Exploration, 83 percent of Insight, and
86 percent of Action decisions, demonstrating human-level reliability at a
fraction of the cost. All code, prompts, synthetic roles, transcripts, and
judgment scripts are released to promote transparent progress in emotionally
supportive AI.

Result: 模型在未见数据上表现差，高数据集内性能常伴随过拟合。数据质量是关键，微调对高质量数据有效，少样本学习对噪声数据更优，零样本基线偶尔表现最佳。

Conclusion: 关系抽取模型的泛化能力受数据质量和基准结构问题限制，需改进数据质量和标准化基准以提升迁移性。

Abstract: Analysing the generalisation capabilities of relation extraction (RE) models
is crucial for assessing whether they learn robust relational patterns or rely
on spurious correlations. Our cross-dataset experiments find that RE models
struggle with unseen data, even within similar domains. Notably, higher
intra-dataset performance does not indicate better transferability, instead
often signaling overfitting to dataset-specific artefacts. Our results also
show that data quality, rather than lexical similarity, is key to robust
transfer, and the choice of optimal adaptation strategy depends on the quality
of data available: while fine-tuning yields the best cross-dataset performance
with high-quality data, few-shot in-context learning (ICL) is more effective
with noisier data. However, even in these cases, zero-shot baselines
occasionally outperform all cross-dataset results. Structural issues in RE
benchmarks, such as single-relation per sample constraints and non-standardised
negative class definitions, further hinder model transferability.

Abstract: Ambiguity remains a fundamental challenge in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) due to the inherent complexity and flexibility of human language. With
the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing ambiguity has become
even more critical due to their expanded capabilities and applications. In the
context of Conversational Question Answering (CQA), this paper explores the
definition, forms, and implications of ambiguity for language driven systems,
particularly in the context of LLMs. We define key terms and concepts,
categorize various disambiguation approaches enabled by LLMs, and provide a
comparative analysis of their advantages and disadvantages. We also explore
publicly available datasets for benchmarking ambiguity detection and resolution
techniques and highlight their relevance for ongoing research. Finally, we
identify open problems and future research directions, proposing areas for
further investigation. By offering a comprehensive review of current research
on ambiguities and disambiguation with LLMs, we aim to contribute to the
development of more robust and reliable language systems.

Conclusion: TrafficSafe为交通安全研究提供了突破性进展，展示了如何将AI技术转化为可操作的、拯救生命的成果。

Abstract: Predicting crash events is crucial for understanding crash distributions and
their contributing factors, thereby enabling the design of proactive traffic
safety policy interventions. However, existing methods struggle to interpret
the complex interplay among various sources of traffic crash data, including
numeric characteristics, textual reports, crash imagery, environmental
conditions, and driver behavior records. As a result, they often fail to
capture the rich semantic information and intricate interrelationships embedded
in these diverse data sources, limiting their ability to identify critical
crash risk factors. In this research, we propose TrafficSafe, a framework that
adapts LLMs to reframe crash prediction and feature attribution as text-based
reasoning. A multi-modal crash dataset including 58,903 real-world reports
together with belonged infrastructure, environmental, driver, and vehicle
information is collected and textualized into TrafficSafe Event Dataset. By
customizing and fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset, the TrafficSafe LLM achieves
a 42% average improvement in F1-score over baselines. To interpret these
predictions and uncover contributing factors, we introduce TrafficSafe
Attribution, a sentence-level feature attribution framework enabling
conditional risk analysis. Findings show that alcohol-impaired driving is the
leading factor in severe crashes, with aggressive and impairment-related
behaviors having nearly twice the contribution for severe crashes compared to
other driver behaviors. Furthermore, TrafficSafe Attribution highlights pivotal
features during model training, guiding strategic crash data collection for
iterative performance improvements. The proposed TrafficSafe offers a
transformative leap in traffic safety research, providing a blueprint for
translating advanced AI technologies into responsible, actionable, and
life-saving outcomes.

Method: 利用概率提取技术从13个开源LLM中提取Books3数据集的内容，并进行多组实验。

Result: 实验表明，部分LLM确实记忆了某些书籍内容（如《哈利·波特》和《1984》），但记忆程度因模型和书籍而异，且大型LLM通常不会记忆大部分书籍。

Conclusion: 研究结果对版权案件有重要影响，但并未明确支持任何一方，表明记忆化与版权的关系需更细致的法律分析。

Abstract: Plaintiffs and defendants in copyright lawsuits over generative AI often make
sweeping, opposing claims about the extent to which large language models
(LLMs) have memorized plaintiffs' protected expression. Drawing on adversarial
ML and copyright law, we show that these polarized positions dramatically
oversimplify the relationship between memorization and copyright. To do so, we
leverage a recent probabilistic extraction technique to extract pieces of the
Books3 dataset from 13 open-weight LLMs. Through numerous experiments, we show
that it's possible to extract substantial parts of at least some books from
different LLMs. This is evidence that the LLMs have memorized the extracted
text; this memorized content is copied inside the model parameters. But the
results are complicated: the extent of memorization varies both by model and by
book. With our specific experiments, we find that the largest LLMs don't
memorize most books -- either in whole or in part. However, we also find that
Llama 3.1 70B memorizes some books, like Harry Potter and 1984, almost
entirely. We discuss why our results have significant implications for
copyright cases, though not ones that unambiguously favor either side.

Method: 开发了一个大型自动标记平行数据集taggedPBC，包含1500多种语言的1800多句POS标记文本。

Conclusion: taggedPBC是跨语言语料库研究的重要进展，未来仍需扩展，数据集已在GitHub开放供研究合作。

Abstract: Existing datasets available for crosslinguistic investigations have tended to
focus on large amounts of data for a small group of languages or a small amount
of data for a large number of languages. This means that claims based on these
datasets are limited in what they reveal about universal properties of the
human language faculty. While this has begun to change through the efforts of
projects seeking to develop tagged corpora for a large number of languages,
such efforts are still constrained by limits on resources. The current paper
reports on a large automatically tagged parallel dataset which has been
developed to partially address this issue. The taggedPBC contains more than
1,800 sentences of pos-tagged parallel text data from over 1,500 languages,
representing 133 language families and 111 isolates, dwarfing previously
available resources. The accuracy of tags in this dataset is shown to correlate
well with both existing SOTA taggers for high-resource languages (SpaCy,
Trankit) as well as hand-tagged corpora (Universal Dependencies Treebanks).
Additionally, a novel measure derived from this dataset, the N1 ratio,
correlates with expert determinations of word order in three typological
databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp) such that a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier
trained on this feature can accurately identify basic word order for languages
not in those databases. While much work is still needed to expand and develop
this dataset, the taggedPBC is an important step to enable corpus-based
crosslinguistic investigations, and is made available for research and
collaboration via GitHub.

Abstract: Drafting patent claims is time-intensive, costly, and requires professional
skill. Therefore, researchers have investigated large language models (LLMs) to
assist inventors in writing claims. However, existing work has largely relied
on datasets from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). To
enlarge research scope regarding various jurisdictions, drafting conventions,
and legal standards, we introduce EPD, a European patent dataset. EPD presents
rich textual data and structured metadata to support multiple patent-related
tasks, including claim generation. This dataset enriches the field in three
critical aspects: (1) Jurisdictional diversity: Patents from different offices
vary in legal and drafting conventions. EPD fills a critical gap by providing a
benchmark for European patents to enable more comprehensive evaluation. (2)
Quality improvement: EPD offers high-quality granted patents with finalized and
legally approved texts, whereas others consist of patent applications that are
unexamined or provisional. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned on EPD
significantly outperform those trained on previous datasets and even GPT-4o in
claim quality and cross-domain generalization. (3) Real-world simulation: We
propose a difficult subset of EPD to better reflect real-world challenges of
claim generation. Results reveal that all tested LLMs perform substantially
worse on these challenging samples, which highlights the need for future
research.

Abstract: Writing novels with Large Language Models (LLMs) raises a critical question:
how much human-authored outline is necessary to generate high-quality
million-word novels? While frameworks such as DOME, Plan&Write, and Long Writer
have improved stylistic coherence and logical consistency, they primarily
target shorter novels (10k--100k words), leaving ultra-long generation largely
unexplored. Drawing on insights from recent text compression methods like
LLMZip and LLM2Vec, we conduct an information-theoretic analysis that
quantifies distortion occurring when LLMs compress and reconstruct ultra-long
novels under varying compression-expansion ratios. We introduce a hierarchical
two-stage generation pipeline (outline -> detailed outline -> manuscript) and
find an optimal outline length that balances information preservation with
human effort. Through extensive experimentation with Chinese novels, we
establish that a two-stage hierarchical outline approach significantly reduces
semantic distortion compared to single-stage methods. Our findings provide
empirically-grounded guidance for authors and researchers collaborating with

TLDR: 通过表示引导技术（在单层激活中添加学习向量），提升大语言模型（LLM）处理非英语标记的能力，效果媲美翻译基线并超越现有提示优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM如何处理非英语标记，填补领域内未解决的问题。

Method: 使用表示引导技术，结合监督微调（SFT）和人类反馈强化学习（RLHF）优化模型。

Result: 单层引导显著提升性能，效果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 表示引导技术结合SFT和RLHF可有效优化LLM的多语言能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMS) process
non-English tokens within their layer representations, an open question despite
significant advancements in the field. Using representation steering,
specifically by adding a learned vector to a single model layer's activations,
we demonstrate that steering a single model layer can notably enhance
performance. Our analysis shows that this approach achieves results comparable
to translation baselines and surpasses state of the art prompt optimization
methods. Additionally, we highlight how advanced techniques like supervised
fine tuning (\textsc{sft}) and reinforcement learning from human feedback
(\textsc{rlhf}) improve multilingual capabilities by altering representation
spaces. We further illustrate how these methods align with our approach to
reshaping LLMS layer representations.

TLDR: CMLFormer是一种改进的双解码器Transformer模型，用于处理代码混合语言的结构挑战，通过共享编码器和同步解码器交叉注意力机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准语言模型难以处理代码混合语言中的频繁语言切换问题，因此需要一种新的架构来捕捉其语言和语义动态。

Method: 提出CMLFormer模型，采用共享编码器和同步解码器交叉注意力机制，预训练时结合切换点和翻译标注，并设计新目标以捕捉切换行为、跨语言结构和代码混合复杂性。

Result: 在HASOC-2021基准测试中，CMLFormer在F1分数、精确度和准确率上优于其他方法，并能有效识别切换点。

Conclusion: CMLFormer的架构和多任务预训练策略有效提升了代码混合语言建模的性能。

Abstract: Code-mixed languages, characterized by frequent within-sentence language
transitions, present structural challenges that standard language models fail
to address. In this work, we propose CMLFormer, an enhanced multi-layer
dual-decoder Transformer with a shared encoder and synchronized decoder
cross-attention, designed to model the linguistic and semantic dynamics of
code-mixed text. CMLFormer is pre-trained on an augmented Hinglish corpus with
switching point and translation annotations with multiple new objectives
specifically aimed at capturing switching behavior, cross-lingual structure,
and code-mixing complexity. Our experiments show that CMLFormer improves F1
score, precision, and accuracy over other approaches on the HASOC-2021
benchmark under select pre-training setups. Attention analyses further show
that it can identify and attend to switching points, validating its sensitivity
to code-mixed structure. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of
CMLFormer's architecture and multi-task pre-training strategy for modeling
code-mixed languages.

Motivation: 当前缺乏系统分析提示的框架，PromptPrism填补了这一空白，帮助理解LLM行为并优化性能。

Method: 提出PromptPrism分类法，包含功能结构、语义组件和句法模式三个层次，并应用于提示优化、数据集分析和敏感性测试。

Result: 实验验证PromptPrism在提示优化、数据集分析和敏感性测试中的有效性。

Conclusion: PromptPrism为提示的优化、分析和理解提供了系统框架。

Abstract: Prompts are the interface for eliciting the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Understanding their structure and components is critical for
analyzing LLM behavior and optimizing performance. However, the field lacks a
comprehensive framework for systematic prompt analysis and understanding. We
introduce PromptPrism, a linguistically-inspired taxonomy that enables prompt
analysis across three hierarchical levels: functional structure, semantic
component, and syntactic pattern. We show the practical utility of PromptPrism
by applying it to three applications: (1) a taxonomy-guided prompt refinement
approach that automatically improves prompt quality and enhances model
performance across a range of tasks; (2) a multi-dimensional dataset profiling
method that extracts and aggregates structural, semantic, and syntactic
characteristics from prompt datasets, enabling comprehensive analysis of prompt
distributions and patterns; (3) a controlled experimental framework for prompt
sensitivity analysis by quantifying the impact of semantic reordering and
delimiter modifications on LLM performance. Our experimental results validate
the effectiveness of our taxonomy across these applications, demonstrating that
PromptPrism provides a foundation for refining, profiling, and analyzing
prompts.

Motivation: 异常检测在多个领域至关重要，但数据多样性和专业库的复杂性为非专家用户带来挑战。

Method: AD-AGENT通过协调多个智能体（意图解析、数据准备、模型选择等），结合短期工作空间和长期缓存，整合流行AD库。

Result: 实验表明AD-AGENT能生成可靠脚本并推荐高性能模型。

Conclusion: AD-AGENT为非专家用户提供了一种高效的异常检测解决方案，并已开源支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is essential in areas such as fraud detection, network
monitoring, and scientific research. However, the diversity of data modalities
and the increasing number of specialized AD libraries pose challenges for
non-expert users who lack in-depth library-specific knowledge and advanced
programming skills. To tackle this, we present AD-AGENT, an LLM-driven
multi-agent framework that turns natural-language instructions into fully
executable AD pipelines. AD-AGENT coordinates specialized agents for intent
parsing, data preparation, library and model selection, documentation mining,
and iterative code generation and debugging. Using a shared short-term
workspace and a long-term cache, the agents integrate popular AD libraries like
PyOD, PyGOD, and TSLib into a unified workflow. Experiments demonstrate that
AD-AGENT produces reliable scripts and recommends competitive models across
libraries. The system is open-sourced to support further research and practical
applications in AD.

Motivation: 探索在多语言和跨语言环境下，传统TF-IDF方法在事实核查声明检索中的竞争力，尤其是在计算资源有限的情况下。

Method: 采用TF-IDF检索系统，实验不同向量维度和分词策略，最佳配置为词级分词和15,000特征的词汇量。

Result: 开发集平均success@10得分为0.78，测试集为0.69，表现优于高资源语言，但落后于顶级系统（0.96）。

Conclusion: 尽管神经网络在多语言检索中占主导，优化后的传统方法（如TF-IDF）仍具竞争力，尤其适用于资源有限场景。

Abstract: This paper presents the Duluth approach to the SemEval-2025 Task 7 on
Multilingual and Crosslingual Fact-Checked Claim Retrieval. We implemented a
TF-IDF-based retrieval system with experimentation on vector dimensions and
tokenization strategies. Our best-performing configuration used word-level
tokenization with a vocabulary size of 15,000 features, achieving an average
success@10 score of 0.78 on the development set and 0.69 on the test set across
ten languages. Our system showed stronger performance on higher-resource
languages but still lagged significantly behind the top-ranked system, which
achieved 0.96 average success@10. Our findings suggest that though advanced
neural architectures are increasingly dominant in multilingual retrieval tasks,
properly optimized traditional methods like TF-IDF remain competitive
baselines, especially in limited compute resource scenarios.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种句子级预归因方法，用于提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在科学领域中的可信度和可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在科学和高风险场景中缺乏可信的输出和准确的来源归因，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 提出句子级预归因步骤，将句子分类为不可归因、可归因于单一引用或多重引用，以优化归因方法的选择。

Result: 结果表明分类器适合此任务，并提供了HAGRID数据集的清理版本及端到端归因系统。

Conclusion: 预归因步骤可降低归因计算复杂度，提升LLMs的可信度和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various science
domains, yet their broader adoption remains constrained by a critical
challenge: the lack of trustworthy, verifiable outputs. Current LLMs often
generate answers without reliable source attribution, or worse, with incorrect
attributions, posing a barrier to their use in scientific and high-stakes
settings, where traceability and accountability are non-negotiable. To be
reliable, attribution systems need high accuracy and retrieve data with short
lengths, i.e., attribute to a sentence within a document rather than a whole
document. We propose a sentence-level pre-attribution step for
Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that classify sentences into three
categories: not attributable, attributable to a single quote, and attributable
to multiple quotes. By separating sentences before attribution, a proper
attribution method can be selected for the type of sentence, or the attribution
can be skipped altogether. Our results indicate that classifiers are
well-suited for this task. In this work, we propose a pre-attribution step to
reduce the computational complexity of attribution, provide a clean version of
the HAGRID dataset, and provide an end-to-end attribution system that works out
of the box.

Motivation: R1模型在政治敏感话题上表现出独特的审查行为，引发了对其透明度、偏见和治理的担忧。

Method: 通过构建大规模提示集，分析R1的审查模式，包括一致性、触发条件和多语言表现，并研究其迁移性及绕过技术。

Result: 发现R1的审查行为可能源于训练或对齐阶段的设计选择，且在不同语言和话题中表现不同。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁对语言模型的透明度和治理进行更严格的监管，以减少潜在的偏见和审查问题。

Abstract: DeepSeek recently released R1, a high-performing large language model (LLM)
optimized for reasoning tasks. Despite its efficient training pipeline, R1
achieves competitive performance, even surpassing leading reasoning models like
OpenAI's o1 on several benchmarks. However, emerging reports suggest that R1
refuses to answer certain prompts related to politically sensitive topics in
China. While existing LLMs often implement safeguards to avoid generating
harmful or offensive outputs, R1 represents a notable shift - exhibiting
censorship-like behavior on politically charged queries. In this paper, we
investigate this phenomenon by first introducing a large-scale set of heavily
curated prompts that get censored by R1, covering a range of politically
sensitive topics, but are not censored by other models. We then conduct a
comprehensive analysis of R1's censorship patterns, examining their
consistency, triggers, and variations across topics, prompt phrasing, and
context. Beyond English-language queries, we explore censorship behavior in
other languages. We also investigate the transferability of censorship to
models distilled from the R1 language model. Finally, we propose techniques for
bypassing or removing this censorship. Our findings reveal possible additional
censorship integration likely shaped by design choices during training or
alignment, raising concerns about transparency, bias, and governance in
language model deployment.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑算法在传统指标上表现优异，但模型仍倾向于生成原始知识，这一问题尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过系统评估，识别并验证了导致表面编辑的两个关键因素：早期层的残差流和后期层的特定注意力模块。

Result: 研究发现特定注意力头及其输出矩阵的左奇异向量与表面编辑有因果关系，且在表面遗忘任务中表现出一致模式。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了知识编辑中的表面编辑问题，并验证了其成因，为未来算法改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Knowledge editing, which aims to update the knowledge encoded in language
models, can be deceptive. Despite the fact that many existing knowledge editing
algorithms achieve near-perfect performance on conventional metrics, the models
edited by them are still prone to generating original knowledge. This paper
introduces the concept of "superficial editing" to describe this phenomenon.
Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that this issue presents a significant
challenge to existing algorithms. Through systematic investigation, we identify
and validate two key factors contributing to this issue: (1) the residual
stream at the last subject position in earlier layers and (2) specific
attention modules in later layers. Notably, certain attention heads in later
layers, along with specific left singular vectors in their output matrices,
encapsulate the original knowledge and exhibit a causal relationship with
superficial editing. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the task of
superficial unlearning, where we observe consistent patterns in the behavior of
specific attention heads and their corresponding left singular vectors, thereby
demonstrating the robustness and broader applicability of our methodology and
conclusions. Our code is available here.

Abstract: This paper addresses the gap in predicting turn-taking and backchannel
actions in human-machine conversations using multi-modal signals (linguistic,
acoustic, and visual). To overcome the limitation of existing datasets, we
propose an automatic data collection pipeline that allows us to collect and
annotate over 210 hours of human conversation videos. From this, we construct a
Multi-Modal Face-to-Face (MM-F2F) human conversation dataset, including over
1.5M words and corresponding turn-taking and backchannel annotations from
approximately 20M frames. Additionally, we present an end-to-end framework that
predicts the probability of turn-taking and backchannel actions from
multi-modal signals. The proposed model emphasizes the interrelation between
modalities and supports any combination of text, audio, and video inputs,
making it adaptable to a variety of realistic scenarios. Our experiments show
that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on turn-taking and
backchannel prediction tasks, achieving a 10\% increase in F1-score on
turn-taking and a 33\% increase on backchannel prediction. Our dataset and code
are publicly available online to ease of subsequent research.

Motivation: 现有 RAG 系统存在自适应控制不可靠和幻觉问题，Know3-RAG 旨在通过结构化知识解决这些问题。

Result: 在多个开放域 QA 基准测试中，Know3-RAG 表现优于基线模型，显著减少幻觉并提高可靠性。

Conclusion: Know3-RAG 通过结构化知识的整合，有效提升了 RAG 系统的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to impressive
progress in natural language generation, yet their tendency to produce
hallucinated or unsubstantiated content remains a critical concern. To improve
factual reliability, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external
knowledge during inference. However, existing RAG systems face two major
limitations: (1) unreliable adaptive control due to limited external knowledge
supervision, and (2) hallucinations caused by inaccurate or irrelevant
references. To address these issues, we propose Know3-RAG, a knowledge-aware
RAG framework that leverages structured knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs)
to guide three core stages of the RAG process, including retrieval, generation,
and filtering. Specifically, we introduce a knowledge-aware adaptive retrieval
module that employs KG embedding to assess the confidence of the generated
answer and determine retrieval necessity, a knowledge-enhanced reference
generation strategy that enriches queries with KG-derived entities to improve
generated reference relevance, and a knowledge-driven reference filtering
mechanism that ensures semantic alignment and factual accuracy of references.
Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks demonstrate that Know3-RAG
consistently outperforms strong baselines, significantly reducing
hallucinations and enhancing answer reliability.

TLDR: 论文提出Shadow-FT框架，通过微调BASE模型并将其权重更新移植到INSTRUCT模型，显著提升性能，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接微调INSTRUCT模型效果有限甚至退化，而BASE模型权重与INSTRUCT模型高度相似，故提出利用BASE模型优化INSTRUCT模型的方法。

Method: 提出Shadow-FT框架，先微调BASE模型，再将学习到的权重更新移植到INSTRUCT模型，无需额外参数且易于实现。

Result: 在19个基准测试中，Shadow-FT优于传统全参数和参数高效微调方法，并可扩展到多模态大语言模型和结合DPO。

Conclusion: Shadow-FT是一种高效、通用的微调方法，显著提升INSTRUCT模型性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) consistently benefit from further fine-tuning on
various tasks. However, we observe that directly tuning the INSTRUCT (i.e.,
instruction tuned) models often leads to marginal improvements and even
performance degeneration. Notably, paired BASE models, the foundation for these
INSTRUCT variants, contain highly similar weight values (i.e., less than 2% on
average for Llama 3.1 8B). Therefore, we propose a novel Shadow-FT framework to
tune the INSTRUCT models by leveraging the corresponding BASE models. The key
insight is to fine-tune the BASE model, and then directly graft the learned
weight updates to the INSTRUCT model. Our proposed Shadow-FT introduces no
additional parameters, is easy to implement, and significantly improves
performance. We conduct extensive experiments on tuning mainstream LLMs, such
as Qwen 3 and Llama 3 series, and evaluate them across 19 benchmarks covering
coding, reasoning, and mathematical tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that Shadow-FT consistently outperforms conventional full-parameter and
parameter-efficient tuning approaches. Further analyses indicate that Shadow-FT
can be applied to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and combined with
direct preference optimization (DPO). Codes and weights are available at

Motivation: 长链思维（CoT）推理存在冗长输出和缺乏系统性的问题，而树状思维（ToT）能通过并行探索推理路径提供更高效的解决方案。

Method: 引入ToTRL框架，结合规则奖励和强化学习，指导大语言模型从序列CoT策略发展为并行ToT策略，并通过解谜游戏训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，ToTQwen3-8B模型在复杂推理任务中显著提升了性能和推理效率。

Conclusion: ToTRL框架有效解决了CoT推理的局限性，为提升大语言模型的推理能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant reasoning capabilities,
particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, which can be
elicited by reinforcement learning (RL). However, prolonged CoT reasoning
presents limitations, primarily verbose outputs due to excessive introspection.
The reasoning process in these LLMs often appears to follow a trial-and-error
methodology rather than a systematic, logical deduction. In contrast,
tree-of-thoughts (ToT) offers a conceptually more advanced approach by modeling
reasoning as an exploration within a tree structure. This reasoning structure
facilitates the parallel generation and evaluation of multiple reasoning
branches, allowing for the active identification, assessment, and pruning of
unproductive paths. This process can potentially lead to improved performance
and reduced token costs. Building upon the long CoT capability of LLMs, we
introduce tree-of-thoughts RL (ToTRL), a novel on-policy RL framework with a
rule-based reward. ToTRL is designed to guide LLMs in developing the parallel
ToT strategy based on the sequential CoT strategy. Furthermore, we employ LLMs
as players in a puzzle game during the ToTRL training process. Solving puzzle
games inherently necessitates exploring interdependent choices and managing
multiple constraints, which requires the construction and exploration of a
thought tree, providing challenging tasks for cultivating the ToT reasoning
capability. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that our ToTQwen3-8B model,
trained with our ToTRL, achieves significant improvement in performance and
reasoning efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 生成式AI在教育内容创作中广泛应用，但其中隐含的偏见（如性别、种族或国家刻板印象）引发伦理和教育问题，目前缺乏系统性检测方法。

Method: 采用上下文嵌入关联测试和提示工程词提取方法，结合检索增强生成框架，对AI生成的导师培训文本进行偏见评估。

Result: 自动化与人工评估的词集高度一致（Pearson相关系数r=0.993），表明方法可靠且一致。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了人为主观性，提高了公平性、可扩展性和可重复性，适用于生成式AI教育内容的偏见审计。

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have
transformed educational content creation, particularly in developing tutor
training materials. However, biases embedded in AI-generated content--such as
gender, racial, or national stereotypes--raise significant ethical and
educational concerns. Despite the growing use of GenAI, systematic methods for
detecting and evaluating such biases in educational materials remain limited.
This study proposes an automated bias assessment approach that integrates the
Contextualized Embedding Association Test with a prompt-engineered word
extraction method within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. We applied
this method to AI-generated texts used in tutor training lessons. Results show
a high alignment between the automated and manually curated word sets, with a
Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.993, indicating reliable and
consistent bias assessment. Our method reduces human subjectivity and enhances
fairness, scalability, and reproducibility in auditing GenAI-produced
educational content.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了LLMs在多种编程语言代码基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 通过代码翻译和OORL框架，LLMs能更好地理解代码功能及跨语言关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in code
generation tasks. However, a significant performance disparity persists between
popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this
capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby
facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming
languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies.
Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a
rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this
coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference
Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO
trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be
guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones,
while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within
the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code
functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs
improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the
relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation
tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across
multiple programming languages.

Result: 在Spider和BIRD上分别达到88.8%和64.9%的准确率，推理时间减少51.9%。

Conclusion: ReEx-SQL显著提升了Text-to-SQL的性能和效率，证明了动态整合执行反馈的有效性。

Abstract: In Text-to-SQL, execution feedback is essential for guiding large language
models (LLMs) to reason accurately and generate reliable SQL queries. However,
existing methods treat execution feedback solely as a post-hoc signal for
correction or selection, failing to integrate it into the generation process.
This limitation hinders their ability to address reasoning errors as they
occur, ultimately reducing query accuracy and robustness. To address this
issue, we propose ReEx-SQL (Reasoning with Execution-Aware Reinforcement
Learning), a framework for Text-to-SQL that enables models to interact with the
database during decoding and dynamically adjust their reasoning based on
execution feedback. ReEx-SQL introduces an execution-aware reasoning paradigm
that interleaves intermediate SQL execution into reasoning paths, facilitating
context-sensitive revisions. It achieves this through structured prompts with
markup tags and a stepwise rollout strategy that integrates execution feedback
into each stage of generation. To supervise policy learning, we develop a
composite reward function that includes an exploration reward, explicitly
encouraging effective database interaction. Additionally, ReEx-SQL adopts a
tree-based decoding strategy to support exploratory reasoning, enabling dynamic
expansion of alternative reasoning paths. Notably, ReEx-SQL achieves 88.8% on
Spider and 64.9% on BIRD at the 7B scale, surpassing the standard reasoning
baseline by 2.7% and 2.6%, respectively. It also shows robustness, achieving
85.2% on Spider-Realistic with leading performance. In addition, its
tree-structured decoding improves efficiency and performance over linear
decoding, reducing inference time by 51.9% on the BIRD development set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有小语言模型训练中的信息丢失、表示对齐低效和激活信号未充分利用问题。

Method: 使用低秩投影矩阵进行软剪枝和激活对齐，无需显式对齐模块。

Result: 在仅使用20B tokens的情况下，性能匹配或超越现有模型，训练效率提升1000倍。

Conclusion: LRC是一种高效的小语言模型预训练方法，显著提升性能和效率。

Abstract: Training high-performing Small Language Models (SLMs) remains costly, even
with knowledge distillation and pruning from larger teacher models. Existing
work often faces three key challenges: (1) information loss from hard pruning,
(2) inefficient alignment of representations, and (3) underutilization of
informative activations, particularly from Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). To
address these challenges, we introduce Low-Rank Clone (LRC), an efficient
pre-training method that constructs SLMs aspiring to behavioral equivalence
with strong teacher models. LRC trains a set of low-rank projection matrices
that jointly enable soft pruning by compressing teacher weights, and activation
clone by aligning student activations, including FFN signals, with those of the
teacher. This unified design maximizes knowledge transfer while removing the
need for explicit alignment modules. Extensive experiments with open-source
teachers (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-3B/7B-Instruct) show that LRC
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models trained on trillions of
tokens--while using only 20B tokens, achieving over 1,000x training efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP模型（如BERT）在文本数据中识别人文价值的能力不如新兴LLMs（如GPTs），但在线LLMs处理长上下文时性能下降且计算成本高。

Method: EAVIT框架使用本地小型语言模型（价值检测器）生成初步估计，再构建简洁输入提示供在线LLMs进行最终识别，并采用解释性训练和数据生成技术优化。

Result: 输入token数量减少至1/6，性能优于传统NLP方法和其他LLM策略。

Conclusion: EAVIT框架在减少计算成本的同时，显著提升了人文价值识别的准确性和效率。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
various fields, including the identification and discovery of human values
within text data. While traditional NLP models, such as BERT, have been
employed for this task, their ability to represent textual data is
significantly outperformed by emerging LLMs like GPTs. However, the performance
of online LLMs often degrades when handling long contexts required for value
identification, which also incurs substantial computational costs. To address
these challenges, we propose EAVIT, an efficient and accurate framework for
human value identification that combines the strengths of both locally
fine-tunable and online black-box LLMs. Our framework employs a value detector
- a small, local language model - to generate initial value estimations. These
estimations are then used to construct concise input prompts for online LLMs,
enabling accurate final value identification. To train the value detector, we
introduce explanation-based training and data generation techniques
specifically tailored for value identification, alongside sampling strategies
to optimize the brevity of LLM input prompts. Our approach effectively reduces
the number of input tokens by up to 1/6 compared to directly querying online
LLMs, while consistently outperforming traditional NLP methods and other
LLM-based strategies.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Decentralized Arena（dearena）的自动化框架，利用所有LLM的集体智慧相互评估，解决了现有基准测试的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLM）的快速发展使得可靠且可扩展的基准测试变得尤为重要，但现有方法存在封闭式问题饱和、人类评估成本高或依赖单一模型导致偏见等问题。

Method: dearena通过民主化的成对评估减少单一模型偏见，并采用粗到细的排名算法和自动问题选择策略，实现高效扩展。

Result: 在66个LLM上的实验表明，dearena与人类判断的相关性高达97%，同时显著降低成本。

Conclusion: dearena提供了一种高效、低成本的自动化评估框架，为LLM的基准测试提供了新方向。

Abstract: The recent explosion of large language models (LLMs), each with its own
general or specialized strengths, makes scalable, reliable benchmarking more
urgent than ever. Standard practices nowadays face fundamental trade-offs:
closed-ended question-based benchmarks (eg MMLU) struggle with saturation as
newer models emerge, while crowd-sourced leaderboards (eg Chatbot Arena) rely
on costly and slow human judges. Recently, automated methods (eg
LLM-as-a-judge) shed light on the scalability, but risk bias by relying on one
or a few "authority" models. To tackle these issues, we propose Decentralized
Arena (dearena), a fully automated framework leveraging collective intelligence
from all LLMs to evaluate each other. It mitigates single-model judge bias by
democratic, pairwise evaluation, and remains efficient at scale through two key
components: (1) a coarse-to-fine ranking algorithm for fast incremental
insertion of new models with sub-quadratic complexity, and (2) an automatic
question selection strategy for the construction of new evaluation dimensions.
Across extensive experiments across 66 LLMs, dearena attains up to 97%
correlation with human judgements, while significantly reducing the cost. Our
code and data will be publicly released on
https://github.com/maitrix-org/de-arena.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: PsyMem提出了一种结合细粒度心理属性和显式记忆控制的角色扮演框架，解决了现有方法在角色建模和记忆一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的角色扮演方法依赖浅层文本描述或简单指标，无法充分建模角色的内外维度，且记忆模拟缺乏显式对齐，影响可靠性。

Method: PsyMem通过26个心理指标补充角色描述，并采用显式记忆对齐训练，动态控制角色响应。基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型和专门数据集（5,414角色和38,962对话）训练。

Result: PsyMem-Qwen在角色扮演中表现优于基线模型，在人类相似性和角色保真度上达到最佳。

Conclusion: PsyMem通过心理属性和显式记忆控制提升了角色扮演的可靠性和表现。

Abstract: Existing LLM-based role-playing methods often rely on superficial textual
descriptions or simplistic metrics, inadequately modeling both intrinsic and
extrinsic character dimensions. Additionally, they typically simulate character
memory with implicit model knowledge or basic retrieval augment generation
without explicit memory alignment, compromising memory consistency. The two
issues weaken reliability of role-playing LLMs in several applications, such as
trustworthy social simulation. To address these limitations, we propose PsyMem,
a novel framework integrating fine-grained psychological attributes and
explicit memory control for role-playing. PsyMem supplements textual
descriptions with 26 psychological indicators to detailed model character.
Additionally, PsyMem implements memory alignment training, explicitly trains
the model to align character's response with memory, thereby enabling dynamic
memory-controlled responding during inference. By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
on our specially designed dataset (including 5,414 characters and 38,962
dialogues extracted from novels), the resulting model, termed as PsyMem-Qwen,
outperforms baseline models in role-playing, achieving the best performance in
human-likeness and character fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在任意风格转换中面临依赖手动提示和固有风格偏见的挑战。

Method: 提出SynDec方法，通过选择代表性样本、四维风格分析和候选重排合成提示，并在解码阶段最大化提示与非提示场景的输出概率对比。

Result: 在六项基准测试中五项优于现有方法，如现代英语到伊丽莎白时代英语转换准确率提升9%。

Conclusion: SynDec有效解决了LLMs在风格转换中的关键问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as dominant forces for textual
style transfer. However, for arbitrary style transfer, LLMs face two key
challenges: (1) considerable reliance on manually-constructed prompts and (2)
rigid stylistic biases inherent in LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel
Synthesize-then-Decode (SynDec) approach, which automatically synthesizes
high-quality prompts and amplifies their roles during decoding process.
Specifically, our approach synthesizes prompts by selecting representative
few-shot samples, conducting a four-dimensional style analysis, and reranking
the candidates. At LLM decoding stage, the TST effect is amplified by
maximizing the contrast in output probabilities between scenarios with and
without the synthesized prompt, as well as between prompts and negative
samples. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show that SynDec
outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on five out of six
benchmarks (e.g., achieving up to a 9\% increase in accuracy for
modern-to-Elizabethan English transfer). Detailed ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of SynDec.

TLDR: 提出了一种对比提示（CP）方法，通过引入辅助提示优化句子嵌入，避免非核心语义信息的干扰，提升现有基于提示的方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过提示工程引导大语言模型（LLM）将句子核心语义编码到最后一个标记的嵌入中，但该标记仍包含过多非必要信息（如停用词），限制了编码能力。

Method: 提出对比提示（CP）方法，通过引入辅助提示与现有提示对比，引导模型编码句子核心语义而非非必要信息。CP是一种即插即用的推理时干预方法。

Result: 在语义文本相似性（STS）任务和下游分类任务中，CP显著提升了不同LLM上基于提示的方法的性能。

Conclusion: CP方法有效优化了句子嵌入，提升了模型性能，且无需额外数据或微调。

Abstract: Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a
practical direction, as it requires neither additional data nor fine-tuning.
Previous studies usually focus on prompt engineering to guide LLMs to encode
the core semantic information of the sentence into the embedding of the last
token. However, the last token in these methods still encodes an excess of
non-essential information, such as stop words, limiting its encoding capacity.
To this end, we propose a Contrastive Prompting (CP) method that introduces an
extra auxiliary prompt to elicit better sentence embedding. By contrasting with
the auxiliary prompt, CP can steer existing prompts to encode the core
semantics of the sentence, rather than non-essential information. CP is a
plug-and-play inference-time intervention method that can be combined with
various prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments on Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our
method can improve the performance of existing prompt-based methods across
different LLMs. Our code will be released at https://github.com/zifengcheng/CP.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is vital
for applications such as disaster response, logistics delivery, and urban
inspection. However, existing methods often struggle with insufficient
multimodal fusion, weak generalization, and poor interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose FlightGPT, a novel UAV VLN framework built upon
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with powerful multimodal perception capabilities.
We design a two-stage training pipeline: first, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
using high-quality demonstrations to improve initialization and structured
reasoning; then, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, guided by
a composite reward that considers goal accuracy, reasoning quality, and format
compliance, to enhance generalization and adaptability. Furthermore, FlightGPT
introduces a Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning mechanism to improve
decision interpretability. Extensive experiments on the city-scale dataset
CityNav demonstrate that FlightGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across
all scenarios, with a 9.22\% higher success rate than the strongest baseline in
unseen environments. Our implementation is publicly available.

Motivation: 法律合同具有语义关键的结构，但LLM处理这种结构的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 比较不同输入格式（如结构化文本、OCR提取文本、GPT-4o Vision提取文本和Markdown）对模型准确率的影响，并评估提示工程的效果。

Result: GPT-4o对输入结构变化鲁棒但整体表现一般，GPT-4.1对结构敏感，优化提示和结构化输入可显著提升其准确率（最高达79%）。

Conclusion: 输入结构化和提示设计对优化LLM性能至关重要，尤其是在高风险的法学应用中。

Abstract: Legal contracts possess an inherent, semantically vital structure (e.g.,
sections, clauses) that is crucial for human comprehension but whose impact on
LLM processing remains under-explored. This paper investigates the effects of
explicit input text structure and prompt engineering on the performance of
GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 on a legal question-answering task using an excerpt of the
CUAD. We compare model exact-match accuracy across various input formats:
well-structured plain-text (human-generated from CUAD), plain-text cleaned of
line breaks, extracted plain-text from Azure OCR, plain-text extracted by
GPT-4o Vision, and extracted (and interpreted) Markdown (MD) from GPT-4o
Vision. To give an indication of the impact of possible prompt engineering, we
assess the impact of shifting task instructions to the system prompt and
explicitly informing the model about the structured nature of the input. Our
findings reveal that GPT-4o demonstrates considerable robustness to variations
in input structure, but lacks in overall performance. Conversely, GPT-4.1's
performance is markedly sensitive; poorly structured inputs yield suboptimal
results (but identical with GPT-4o), while well-structured formats (original
CUAD text, GPT-4o Vision text and GPT-4o MD) improve exact-match accuracy by
~20 percentage points. Optimizing the system prompt to include task details and
an advisory about structured input further elevates GPT-4.1's accuracy by an
additional ~10-13 percentage points, with Markdown ultimately achieving the
highest performance under these conditions (79 percentage points overall
exact-match accuracy). This research empirically demonstrates that while newer
models exhibit greater resilience, careful input structuring and strategic
prompt design remain critical for optimizing the performance of LLMs, and can
significantly affect outcomes in high-stakes legal applications.

Motivation: 研究去标识化方法的鲁棒性，验证个人信息是否容易被重新识别。

Method: 采用RAG启发的两步法：检索器选择相关背景知识段落，填充模型推断被掩码的原始内容。

Result: 在三个数据集上测试，80%的去标识化文本可被恢复，且背景知识越多，重新识别准确率越高。

Conclusion: 去标识化方法可能不够鲁棒，需进一步改进以保护隐私。

Abstract: Documents revealing sensitive information about individuals must typically be
de-identified. This de-identification is often done by masking all mentions of
personally identifiable information (PII), thereby making it more difficult to
uncover the identity of the person(s) in question. To investigate the
robustness of de-identification methods, we present a novel, RAG-inspired
approach that attempts the reverse process of re-identification based on a
database of documents representing background knowledge. Given a text in which
personal identifiers have been masked, the re-identification proceeds in two
steps. A retriever first selects from the background knowledge passages deemed
relevant for the re-identification. Those passages are then provided to an
infilling model which seeks to infer the original content of each text span.
This process is repeated until all masked spans are replaced. We evaluate the
re-identification on three datasets (Wikipedia biographies, court rulings and
clinical notes). Results show that (1) as many as 80% of de-identified text
spans can be successfully recovered and (2) the re-identification accuracy
increases along with the level of background knowledge.

Abstract: Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models
(LLMs) in spite of recent advances in test-time scaling. We introduce LEXam, a
novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses
across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law
exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended
questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the
open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected
legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule
application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions
present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably
struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal
reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in
differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Adopting an
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate
how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and
accurately. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗对话系统中的药物推荐任务需要关注患者与医生交互的细节，而现有基于电子健康记录的方法无法满足。大型语言模型虽能提供建议，但可能忽略关键信息或生成不准确回应。

Method: GAP框架通过提取对话中的医疗概念构建患者中心图，结合外部知识图谱生成查询和提示，以减少非事实性回应。

Result: 在对话式药物推荐数据集上评估，GAP表现优异，并在动态诊断访谈中展示了潜力。

Conclusion: GAP框架有效提升了对话式药物推荐的准确性和安全性，为医疗对话系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Medication recommendations have become an important task in the healthcare
domain, especially in measuring the accuracy and safety of medical dialogue
systems (MDS). Different from the recommendation task based on electronic
health records (EHRs), dialogue-based medication recommendations require
research on the interaction details between patients and doctors, which is
crucial but may not exist in EHRs. Recent advancements in large language models
(LLM) have extended the medical dialogue domain. These LLMs can interpret
patients' intent and provide medical suggestions including medication
recommendations, but some challenges are still worth attention. During a
multi-turn dialogue, LLMs may ignore the fine-grained medical information or
connections across the dialogue turns, which is vital for providing accurate
suggestions. Besides, LLMs may generate non-factual responses when there is a
lack of domain-specific knowledge, which is more risky in the medical domain.
To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{G}raph-\textbf{A}ssisted
\textbf{P}rompts (\textbf{GAP}) framework for dialogue-based medication
recommendation. It extracts medical concepts and corresponding states from
dialogue to construct an explicitly patient-centric graph, which can describe
the neglected but important information. Further, combined with external
medical knowledge graphs, GAP can generate abundant queries and prompts, thus
retrieving information from multiple sources to reduce the non-factual
responses. We evaluate GAP on a dialogue-based medication recommendation
dataset and further explore its potential in a more difficult scenario,
dynamically diagnostic interviewing. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
competitive performance when compared with strong baselines.

Motivation: 人类通过语言进行System 2推理，但LLMs在建模语言时容易吸收语言偏差，导致推理偏离思维链。本文旨在揭示并解决这一偏差问题。

Method: 提出LoT技术，通过调整表达顺序和用词来减少语言偏差，而非直接从部分信息中引出思维链。

Result: LoT显著减少了LLMs中的语言建模偏差，并在多种推理任务中提升了性能。

Conclusion: LoT是一种简单有效的技术，能够改善LLMs的推理能力，减少语言与思维之间的建模差距。

Abstract: System 2 reasoning is one of the defining characteristics of intelligence,
which requires slow and logical thinking. Human conducts System 2 reasoning via
the language of thoughts that organizes the reasoning process as a causal
sequence of mental language, or thoughts. Recently, it has been observed that
System 2 reasoning can be elicited from Large Language Models (LLMs)
pre-trained on large-scale natural languages. However, in this work, we show
that there is a significant gap between the modeling of languages and thoughts.
As language is primarily a tool for humans to share knowledge and thinking,
modeling human language can easily absorb language biases into LLMs deviated
from the chain of thoughts in minds. Furthermore, we show that the biases will
mislead the eliciting of "thoughts" in LLMs to focus only on a biased part of
the premise. To this end, we propose a new prompt technique termed
Language-of-Thoughts (LoT) to demonstrate and alleviate this gap. Instead of
directly eliciting the chain of thoughts from partial information, LoT
instructs LLMs to adjust the order and token used for the expressions of all
the relevant information. We show that the simple strategy significantly
reduces the language modeling biases in LLMs and improves the performance of
LLMs across a variety of reasoning tasks.

such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) demonstrating exceptional
effectiveness. In this study, we identify a critical yet underexplored issue in
RL training: low-probability tokens disproportionately influence model updates
due to their large gradient magnitudes. This dominance hinders the effective
learning of high-probability tokens, whose gradients are essential for LLMs'
performance but are substantially suppressed. To mitigate this interference, we
propose two novel methods: Advantage Reweighting and Low-Probability Token
Isolation (Lopti), both of which effectively attenuate gradients from
low-probability tokens while emphasizing parameter updates driven by
high-probability tokens. Our approaches promote balanced updates across tokens
with varying probabilities, thereby enhancing the efficiency of RL training.
Experimental results demonstrate that they substantially improve the
performance of GRPO-trained LLMs, achieving up to a 46.2% improvement in K&K
Logic Puzzle reasoning tasks. Our implementation is available at

*Jeffrey T. H. Wong,Cheng Zhang,Xinye Cao,Pedro Gimenes,George A. Constantinides,Wayne Luk,Yiren Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为A³的后训练低秩近似框架，通过将Transformer层分为三个功能组件并优化其功能损失，显著降低了模型大小和计算开销，同时保持性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型参数量庞大导致部署成本高，现有低秩近似方法未考虑Transformer架构特性且存在运行时开销，因此需要一种更高效的压缩方案。

Method: A³将Transformer层分为QK、OV和MLP三个组件，为每个组件提供解析解以减少隐藏维度大小并最小化功能损失，从而直接减小模型大小和计算量。

Result: 在相同计算和内存预算下，A³压缩的LLaMA 3.1-70B在WikiText-2上的困惑度为4.69，优于之前SoTA的7.87。

Conclusion: A³不仅高效压缩模型，还支持KV缓存压缩、量化和混合秩分配，为低秩近似提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance; however,
their massive parameter counts make deployment highly expensive. Low-rank
approximation offers a promising compression solution, yet existing approaches
have two main limitations: (1) They focus on minimizing the output error of
individual linear layers, without considering the architectural characteristics
of Transformers, and (2) they decompose a large weight matrix into two small
low-rank matrices. Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to
other compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce
runtime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small
matrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\tt A^\tt 3$, a
post-training low-rank approximation framework. $\tt A^\tt 3$ splits a
Transformer layer into three functional components, namely $\tt QK$, $\tt OV$,
and $\tt MLP$. For each component, $\tt A^\tt 3$ provides an analytical
solution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while
minimizing the component's functional loss ($\it i.e.$, error in attention
scores, attention outputs, and MLP outputs). This approach directly reduces
model sizes, KV cache sizes, and FLOPs without introducing any runtime
overheads. In addition, it provides a new narrative in advancing the
optimization problem from singular linear layer loss optimization toward
improved end-to-end performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that
$\tt A^\tt 3$ maintains superior performance compared to SoTAs. For example,
under the same reduction budget in computation and memory, our low-rank
approximated LLaMA 3.1-70B achieves a perplexity of 4.69 on WikiText-2,
outperforming the previous SoTA's 7.87 by 3.18. We also demonstrate the
versatility of $\tt A^\tt 3$, including KV cache compression, quantization, and
mixed-rank assignments for enhanced performance.

Motivation: 形态解析对于粘着语（如南非的Nguni语言）尤为困难，论文旨在探索神经网络方法在此任务中的有效性。

Method: 采用两种方法：从头训练的神经网络序列标记器（LSTM和神经CRF）和微调预训练语言模型，并与基于规则的解析器对比。

Result: 神经网络标记器显著优于基于规则的基线，且从头训练的模型通常优于预训练模型。

Conclusion: 研究证实了基于现有形态分割器的神经网络标记器在Nguni语言中的可行性。

Abstract: Morphological parsing is the task of decomposing words into morphemes, the
smallest units of meaning in a language, and labelling their grammatical roles.
It is a particularly challenging task for agglutinative languages, such as the
Nguni languages of South Africa, which construct words by concatenating
multiple morphemes. A morphological parsing system can be framed as a pipeline
with two separate components, a segmenter followed by a tagger. This paper
investigates the use of neural methods to build morphological taggers for the
four Nguni languages. We compare two classes of approaches: training neural
sequence labellers (LSTMs and neural CRFs) from scratch and finetuning
pretrained language models. We compare performance across these two categories,
as well as to a traditional rule-based morphological parser. Neural taggers
comfortably outperform the rule-based baseline and models trained from scratch
tend to outperform pretrained models. We also compare parsing results across
different upstream segmenters and with varying linguistic input features. Our
findings confirm the viability of employing neural taggers based on
pre-existing morphological segmenters for the Nguni languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律文本检索（LPR）因查询与目标段落词汇不匹配而未被充分探索，亟需解决方案。

Method: 提出GuRE方法，通过训练LLM生成改写查询，以缓解词汇不匹配问题。

Result: 实验表明GuRE显著提升检索性能，优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: GuRE比直接微调检索器更适合实际应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Legal Passage Retrieval (LPR) systems are crucial as they help practitioners
save time when drafting legal arguments. However, it remains an underexplored
avenue. One primary reason is the significant vocabulary mismatch between the
query and the target passage. To address this, we propose a simple yet
effective method, the Generative query REwriter (GuRE). We leverage the
generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by training the LLM for
query rewriting. "Rewritten queries" help retrievers to retrieve target
passages by mitigating vocabulary mismatch. Experimental results show that GuRE
significantly improves performance in a retriever-agnostic manner,
outperforming all baseline methods. Further analysis reveals that different
training objectives lead to distinct retrieval behaviors, making GuRE more
suitable than direct retriever fine-tuning for real-world applications. Codes
are avaiable at github.com/daehuikim/GuRE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念识别方法难以捕捉文本中未明确提及的复杂概念，限制了知识图谱构建和本体精炼的效果。

Method: MA-COIR将概念识别重新定义为索引-识别任务，使用语义搜索索引（ssIDs）消除歧义，并基于预训练的BART模型进行微调，结合LLM生成的查询和合成数据优化低资源场景。

Result: 在CDR、HPO和HOIP三个场景中，MA-COIR有效识别显式和隐式概念，无需推理时的提及级标注。

Conclusion: MA-COIR为生物医学领域的概念识别提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，推动了本体驱动的应用发展。

Abstract: Recognizing biomedical concepts in the text is vital for ontology refinement,
knowledge graph construction, and concept relationship discovery. However,
traditional concept recognition methods, relying on explicit mention
identification, often fail to capture complex concepts not explicitly stated in
the text. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MA-COIR, a framework that
reformulates concept recognition as an indexing-recognition task. By assigning
semantic search indexes (ssIDs) to concepts, MA-COIR resolves ambiguities in
ontology entries and enhances recognition efficiency. Using a pretrained
BART-based model fine-tuned on small datasets, our approach reduces
computational requirements to facilitate adoption by domain experts.
Furthermore, we incorporate large language models (LLMs)-generated queries and
synthetic data to improve recognition in low-resource settings. Experimental
results on three scenarios (CDR, HPO, and HOIP) highlight the effectiveness of
MA-COIR in recognizing both explicit and implicit concepts without the need for
mention-level annotations during inference, advancing ontology-driven concept
recognition in biomedical domain applications. Our code and constructed data
are available at https://github.com/sl-633/macoir-master.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper在非语音段存在幻觉问题，限制了其工业应用。

Method: 通过头掩码分析Whisper解码器中各注意力头的贡献，并微调关键头以减少幻觉。

Result: 微调后的Calm-Whisper模型在非语音段幻觉减少80%，且WER仅增加0.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了Whisper的幻觉问题，同时保持了较高的识别准确性。

Abstract: OpenAI's Whisper has achieved significant success in Automatic Speech
Recognition. However, it has consistently been found to exhibit hallucination
issues, particularly in non-speech segments, which limits its broader
application in complex industrial settings.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel method to reduce Whisper's hallucination
on non-speech segments without using any pre- or post-possessing techniques.
Specifically, we benchmark the contribution of each self-attentional head in
the Whisper-large-v3 decoder to the hallucination problem by performing a
head-wise mask. Our findings reveal that only 3 of the 20 heads account for
over 75% of the hallucinations on the UrbanSound dataset. We then fine-tune
these three crazy heads using a collection of non-speech data. The results show
that our best fine-tuned model, namely Calm-Whisper, achieves over 80%
reduction in non-speech hallucination with only less than 0.1% WER degradation
on LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other.

Abstract: The continued rise of neural networks and large language models in the more
recent past has altered the natural language processing landscape, enabling new
approaches towards typical language tasks and achieving mainstream success.
Despite the huge success of large language models, many disadvantages still
remain and through this work we assess the state of the art in five application
scenarios with a particular focus on the future perspectives and sensible
application scenarios of traditional and older approaches and techniques.
  In this paper we survey recent publications in the application scenarios
classification, information and relation extraction, text simplification as
well as text summarization. After defining our terminology, i.e., which
features are characteristic for traditional techniques in our interpretation
for the five scenarios, we survey if such traditional approaches are still
being used, and if so, in what way they are used. It turns out that all five
application scenarios still exhibit traditional models in one way or another,
as part of a processing pipeline, as a comparison/baseline to the core model of
the respective paper, or as the main model(s) of the paper. For the complete

Result: 深度学习与规则系统的同形异义词消歧准确率提升约30%。

Conclusion: 通过半自动化数据集构建和规则方法改进，有效解决了G2P转换中的同形异义词消歧问题，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Homograph disambiguation remains a significant challenge in
grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, especially for low-resource languages.
This challenge is twofold: (1) creating balanced and comprehensive homograph
datasets is labor-intensive and costly, and (2) specific disambiguation
strategies introduce additional latency, making them unsuitable for real-time
applications such as screen readers and other accessibility tools. In this
paper, we address both issues. First, we propose a semi-automated pipeline for
constructing homograph-focused datasets, introduce the HomoRich dataset
generated through this pipeline, and demonstrate its effectiveness by applying
it to enhance a state-of-the-art deep learning-based G2P system for Persian.
Second, we advocate for a paradigm shift - utilizing rich offline datasets to
inform the development of fast, rule-based methods suitable for
latency-sensitive accessibility applications like screen readers. To this end,
we improve one of the most well-known rule-based G2P systems, eSpeak, into a
fast homograph-aware version, HomoFast eSpeak. Our results show an approximate
30% improvement in homograph disambiguation accuracy for the deep
learning-based and eSpeak systems.

Result: 零样本LLMs与传统微调模型竞争，指令调优后开源LLMs表现更优，但存在事实性问题。

Conclusion: LLMs在M2MS任务中表现良好，但需解决事实性问题，未来研究应关注如何控制事实错误。

Abstract: Many-to-many summarization (M2MS) aims to process documents in any language
and generate the corresponding summaries also in any language. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have shown strong multi-lingual abilities, giving them
the potential to perform M2MS in real applications. This work presents a
systematic empirical study on LLMs' M2MS ability. Specifically, we first
reorganize M2MS data based on eight previous domain-specific datasets. The
reorganized data contains 47.8K samples spanning five domains and six
languages, which could be used to train and evaluate LLMs. Then, we benchmark
18 LLMs in a zero-shot manner and an instruction-tuning manner. Fine-tuned
traditional models (e.g., mBART) are also conducted for comparisons. Our
experiments reveal that, zero-shot LLMs achieve competitive results with
fine-tuned traditional models. After instruct-tuning, open-source LLMs can
significantly improve their M2MS ability, and outperform zero-shot LLMs
(including GPT-4) in terms of automatic evaluations. In addition, we
demonstrate that this task-specific improvement does not sacrifice the LLMs'
general task-solving abilities. However, as revealed by our human evaluation,
LLMs still face the factuality issue, and the instruction tuning might
intensify the issue. Thus, how to control factual errors becomes the key when
building LLM summarizers in real applications, and is worth noting in future
research.

Motivation: 现有大型推理模型（LRMs）在机器翻译（MT）中主要关注高资源语言，且奖励建模方法未能充分发挥强化学习的潜力。

Method: 设计了一种新的奖励建模方法，通过比较策略MT模型与强LRM（DeepSeek-R1-671B）的翻译结果，量化比较以提供奖励。

Result: 实验表明该方法优越，使用Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct的模型在文学翻译中超越OpenAI-o1和DeepSeek-R1，并扩展到11种语言的90个翻译方向。

Conclusion: 新奖励建模方法显著提升了多语言机器翻译性能，展示了强化学习在MT中的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, has shown impressive capabilities in complex
problems, e.g., mathematics and coding. Some pioneering studies attempt to
bring the success of LRMs in neural machine translation (MT). They try to build
LRMs with deep reasoning MT ability via reinforcement learning (RL). Despite
some progress that has been made, these attempts generally focus on several
high-resource languages, e.g., English and Chinese, leaving the performance on
other languages unclear. Besides, the reward modeling methods in previous work
do not fully unleash the potential of reinforcement learning in MT. In this
work, we first design a new reward modeling method that compares the
translation results of the policy MT model with a strong LRM (i.e.,
DeepSeek-R1-671B), and quantifies the comparisons to provide rewards.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the reward modeling method.
Using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the backbone, the trained model achieves the new
state-of-the-art performance in literary translation, and outperforms strong
LRMs including OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeeK-R1. Furthermore, we extend our method to
the multilingual settings with 11 languages. With a carefully designed
lightweight reward modeling in RL, we can simply transfer the strong MT ability
from a single direction into multiple (i.e., 90) translation directions and
achieve impressive multilingual MT performance.

Result: LLM生成的代码效率平均仅为人类专家的62%，且在Python、Ruby、JavaScript中表现较好，而在Java、C++、Golang中较差。

Conclusion: 研究强调了改进LLM在多语言中代码效率优化技术的必要性。

Abstract: Existing code generation benchmarks primarily evaluate functional
correctness, with limited focus on code efficiency and often restricted to a
single language like Python. To address this gap, we introduce EffiBench-X, the
first multi-language benchmark designed to measure the efficiency of
LLM-generated code. EffiBench-X supports Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Ruby,
and Golang. It comprises competitive programming tasks with human-expert
solutions as efficiency baselines. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on
EffiBench-X reveals that while models generate functionally correct code, they
consistently underperform human experts in efficiency. Even the most efficient
LLM-generated solutions (Qwen3-32B) achieve only around \textbf{62\%} of human
efficiency on average, with significant language-specific variations. LLMs show
better efficiency in Python, Ruby, and JavaScript than in Java, C++, and
Golang. For instance, DeepSeek-R1's Python code is significantly more efficient
than its Java code. These results highlight the critical need for research into
LLM optimization techniques to improve code efficiency across diverse
languages. The dataset and evaluation infrastructure are submitted and

Conclusion: 推荐SQL RAG和Graph RAG用于机场环境，因其幻觉少且能处理动态问题。

Abstract: Airports from the top 20 in terms of annual passengers are highly dynamic
environments with thousands of flights daily, and they aim to increase the
degree of automation. To contribute to this, we implemented a Conversational AI
system that enables staff in an airport to communicate with flight information
systems. This system not only answers standard airport queries but also
resolves airport terminology, jargon, abbreviations, and dynamic questions
involving reasoning. In this paper, we built three different
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods, including traditional RAG, SQL
RAG, and Knowledge Graph-based RAG (Graph RAG). Experiments showed that
traditional RAG achieved 84.84% accuracy using BM25 + GPT-4 but occasionally
produced hallucinations, which is risky to airport safety. In contrast, SQL RAG
and Graph RAG achieved 80.85% and 91.49% accuracy respectively, with
significantly fewer hallucinations. Moreover, Graph RAG was especially
effective for questions that involved reasoning. Based on our observations, we
thus recommend SQL RAG and Graph RAG are better for airport environments, due
to fewer hallucinations and the ability to handle dynamic questions.

Conclusion: 研究为构建更鲁棒、可解释的媒体偏见检测系统提供了基础，未来可探索上下文建模和偏见类型分类。

Abstract: Media bias detection is a critical task in ensuring fair and balanced
information dissemination, yet it remains challenging due to the subjectivity
of bias and the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this work, we
perform sentence-level bias classification by fine-tuning a RoBERTa-based model
on the expert-annotated BABE dataset. Using McNemar's test and the 5x2
cross-validation paired t-test, we show statistically significant improvements
in performance when comparing our model to a domain-adaptively pre-trained
DA-RoBERTa baseline. Furthermore, attention-based analysis shows that our model
avoids common pitfalls like oversensitivity to politically charged terms and
instead attends more meaningfully to contextually relevant tokens. For a
comprehensive examination of media bias, we present a pipeline that combines
our model with an already-existing bias-type classifier. Our method exhibits
good generalization and interpretability, despite being constrained by
sentence-level analysis and dataset size because of a lack of larger and more
advanced bias corpora. We talk about context-aware modeling, bias
neutralization, and advanced bias type classification as potential future
directions. Our findings contribute to building more robust, explainable, and
socially responsible NLP systems for media bias detection.

Result: topicwizard能够帮助用户更全面、准确地理解主题模型的内容。

Conclusion: topicwizard为模型无关的主题模型解释提供了有效的可视化解决方案。

Abstract: Topic models are statistical tools that allow their users to gain qualitative
and quantitative insights into the contents of textual corpora without the need
for close reading. They can be applied in a wide range of settings from
discourse analysis, through pretraining data curation, to text filtering. Topic
models are typically parameter-rich, complex models, and interpreting these
parameters can be challenging for their users. It is typical practice for users
to interpret topics based on the top 10 highest ranking terms on a given topic.
This list-of-words approach, however, gives users a limited and biased picture
of the content of topics. Thoughtful user interface design and visualizations
can help users gain a more complete and accurate understanding of topic models'
output. While some visualization utilities do exist for topic models, these are
typically limited to a certain type of topic model. We introduce topicwizard, a
framework for model-agnostic topic model interpretation, that provides
intuitive and interactive tools that help users examine the complex semantic
relations between documents, words and topics learned by topic models.

Abstract: The scope of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation
(IWSLT) has recently broadened beyond traditional Speech Translation (ST) to
encompass a wider array of tasks, including Speech Question Answering and
Summarization. This shift is partly driven by the growing capabilities of
modern systems, particularly with the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
In this paper, we present the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology's submissions
for the Offline ST and Instruction Following (IF) tracks, where we leverage
LLMs to enhance performance across all tasks. For the Offline ST track, we
propose a pipeline that employs multiple automatic speech recognition systems,
whose outputs are fused using an LLM with document-level context. This is
followed by a two-step translation process, incorporating additional refinement
step to improve translation quality. For the IF track, we develop an end-to-end
model that integrates a speech encoder with an LLM to perform a wide range of
instruction-following tasks. We complement it with a final document-level
refinement stage to further enhance output quality by using contextual
information.

Abstract: Adapting to the addressee is crucial for successful explanations, yet poses
significant challenges for dialogsystems. We adopt the approach of treating
explanation generation as a non-stationary decision process, where the optimal
strategy varies according to changing beliefs about the explainee and the
interaction context. In this paper we address the questions of (1) how to track
the interaction context and the relevant listener features in a formally
defined computational partner model, and (2) how to utilize this model in the
dynamically adjusted, rational decision process that determines the currently
best explanation strategy. We propose a Bayesian inference-based approach to
continuously update the partner model based on user feedback, and a
non-stationary Markov Decision Process to adjust decision-making based on the
partner model values. We evaluate an implementation of this framework with five
simulated interlocutors, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to
different partners with constant and even changing feedback behavior. The
results show high adaptivity with distinct explanation strategies emerging for
different partners, highlighting the potential of our approach to improve
explainable AI systems and dialogsystems in general.

Motivation: 解决青少年自杀风险评估的需求，探索多模态方法在语音分析中的应用。

Method: 结合WhisperX转录、RoBERTa和WavLM嵌入，以及手工声学特征，测试了三种融合策略。

Result: 加权注意力策略在开发集上达到69%准确率，但测试集表现显示泛化挑战。

Conclusion: 需优化嵌入表示和融合机制以提高分类可靠性，研究结果基于MINI-KID框架。

Abstract: The 1st SpeechWellness Challenge conveys the need for speech-based suicide
risk assessment in adolescents. This study investigates a multimodal approach
for this challenge, integrating automatic transcription with WhisperX,
linguistic embeddings from Chinese RoBERTa, and audio embeddings from WavLM.
Additionally, handcrafted acoustic features -- including MFCCs, spectral
contrast, and pitch-related statistics -- were incorporated. We explored three
fusion strategies: early concatenation, modality-specific processing, and
weighted attention with mixup regularization. Results show that weighted
attention provided the best generalization, achieving 69% accuracy on the
development set, though a performance gap between development and test sets
highlights generalization challenges. Our findings, strictly tied to the
MINI-KID framework, emphasize the importance of refining embedding
representations and fusion mechanisms to enhance classification reliability.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为NTIL的损失函数，通过结合token级和序列级的优化，改进了自回归模型在数值序列生成中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自回归模型将数字视为独立标记并应用交叉熵损失，忽略了数值序列的连贯结构。NTIL旨在填补这一空白。

Method: NTIL在token级扩展了Earth Mover's Distance（EMD）以保留数值间的序关系，在序列级惩罚预测与实际序列的整体差异。

Result: 实验表明，NTIL显著提升了数值预测的性能。

Conclusion: NTIL是一种有效的损失函数，能够与LLMs/MLLMs无缝集成，改进数值序列生成任务。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have become the de facto choice for sequence generation
tasks, but standard approaches treat digits as independent tokens and apply
cross-entropy loss, overlooking the coherent structure of numerical sequences.
This paper introduces Numerical Token Integrity Loss (NTIL) to address this
gap. NTIL operates at two levels: (1) token-level, where it extends the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) to preserve ordinal relationships between numerical
values, and (2) sequence-level, where it penalizes the overall discrepancy
between the predicted and actual sequences. This dual approach improves
numerical prediction and integrates effectively with LLMs/MLLMs. Extensive
experiments show significant performance improvements with NTIL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在系统泛化方面表现不佳，尤其是在新上下文中处理已知概念时。缺乏衡量问题难度的标准是研究的主要动机。

Method: 提出一个框架，通过序列到序列任务中组件部分的熵来量化系统泛化的难度，并分析不同模型架构的性能与熵的关系。

Result: 研究发现模型性能与熵呈正相关，高熵情况下即使没有内置先验也能成功，低熵表现可作为评估系统泛化进展的目标。

Conclusion: 研究将系统泛化与信息效率联系起来，为评估和改进语言模型的系统泛化能力提供了新视角。

Abstract: Systematic generalization remains challenging for current language models,
which are known to be both sensitive to semantically similar permutations of
the input and to struggle with known concepts presented in novel contexts.
Although benchmarks exist for assessing compositional behavior, it is unclear
how to measure the difficulty of a systematic generalization problem. In this
work, we show how one aspect of systematic generalization can be described by
the entropy of the distribution of component parts in the training data. We
formalize a framework for measuring entropy in a sequence-to-sequence task and
find that the performance of popular model architectures scales with the
entropy. Our work connects systematic generalization to information efficiency,
and our results indicate that success at high entropy can be achieved even
without built-in priors, and that success at low entropy can serve as a target
for assessing progress towards robust systematic generalization.

Motivation: 解决先前研究中关于语言多样性在LLM微调中效果的矛盾结论。

Method: 通过132个翻译方向的受控微调实验，系统分析语言多样性的影响。

Result: 语言多样性提升翻译质量，但存在阈值；多样性促进语言无关表征的形成。

Conclusion: 语言多样性有助于提升模型性能，但需注意多样性阈值。

Abstract: Prior research diverges on language diversity in LLM fine-tuning: Some
studies report benefits while others find no advantages. Through controlled
fine-tuning experiments across 132 translation directions, we systematically
resolve these disparities. We find that expanding language diversity during
fine-tuning improves translation quality for both unsupervised and --
surprisingly -- supervised pairs, despite less diverse models being fine-tuned
exclusively on these supervised pairs. However, benefits plateau or decrease
beyond a certain diversity threshold. We show that increased language diversity
creates more language-agnostic representations. These representational
adaptations help explain the improved performance in models fine-tuned with
greater diversity.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为TREA的新型数据集，用于评估大型音频语言模型（LALMs）在时序推理任务上的表现，并发现现有模型与人类能力存在差距。同时，论文提出了一种不确定性度量方法，用于评估模型对输入扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态社区希望将文本、视觉和音频结合以实现类似文本大语言模型（LLM）的成功。为此，需要评估LALMs在推理任务上的表现，而传统分类或生成任务无法满足这一需求。

Method: 提出TREA数据集，用于评估LALMs的时序推理能力，并引入一种不确定性度量方法，计算模型对语义相同输入扰动的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，开源LALMs在TREA任务上表现不及人类。不确定性度量与准确性无必然相关性，表明需要更全面的评估方法。

Conclusion: 论文强调了LALMs在高风险应用中需要更全面的评估，并提出了TREA数据集和不确定性度量作为评估工具。

Abstract: The popular success of text-based large language models (LLM) has streamlined
the attention of the multimodal community to combine other modalities like
vision and audio along with text to achieve similar multimodal capabilities. In
this quest, large audio language models (LALMs) have to be evaluated on
reasoning related tasks which are different from traditional classification or
generation tasks. Towards this goal, we propose a novel dataset called temporal
reasoning evaluation of audio (TREA).
  We benchmark open-source LALMs and observe that they are consistently behind
human capabilities on the tasks in the TREA dataset. While evaluating LALMs, we
also propose an uncertainty metric, which computes the invariance of the model
to semantically identical perturbations of the input. Our analysis shows that
the accuracy and uncertainty metrics are not necessarily correlated and thus,
points to a need for wholesome evaluation of LALMs for high-stakes
applications.

Motivation: 探究LLMs如何实现跨语言知识迁移，并解决多语言推理中的输出不一致问题。

Method: 应用logit lens分析LLMs解决多语言多选题的隐含步骤，并通过引导模型处理至共享语义空间调节知识共享。

Result: LLMs依赖单语言子空间导致预测不一致；大模型隐藏状态更易脱离共享表示，但跨语言知识检索能力更强；引导共享空间可提升推理性能。

Conclusion: 通过强化共享语义空间利用，可改善LLMs的多语言推理表现和输出一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are demonstrably capable of cross-lingual
transfer, but can produce inconsistent output when prompted with the same
queries written in different languages. To understand how language models are
able to generalize knowledge from one language to the others, we apply the
logit lens to interpret the implicit steps taken by LLMs to solve multilingual
multi-choice reasoning questions. We find LLMs predict inconsistently and are
less accurate because they rely on subspaces of individual languages, rather
than working in a shared semantic space. While larger models are more
multilingual, we show their hidden states are more likely to dissociate from
the shared representation compared to smaller models, but are nevertheless more
capable of retrieving knowledge embedded across different languages. Finally,
we demonstrate that knowledge sharing can be modulated by steering the models'
latent processing towards the shared semantic space. We find reinforcing
utilization of the shared space improves the models' multilingual reasoning
performance, as a result of more knowledge transfer from, and better output
consistency with English.

Result: 传统欺骗线索在DeFaBel中相关性微弱，模型表现接近随机，不同数据集间线索不一致。

Conclusion: 文本欺骗检测不可靠，需重新思考NLP中欺骗研究的方法。

Abstract: Can deception be detected solely from written text? Cues of deceptive
communication are inherently subtle, even more so in text-only communication.
Yet, prior studies have reported considerable success in automatic deception
detection. We hypothesize that such findings are largely driven by artifacts
introduced during data collection and do not generalize beyond specific
datasets. We revisit this assumption by introducing a belief-based deception
framework, which defines deception as a misalignment between an author's claims
and true beliefs, irrespective of factual accuracy, allowing deception cues to
be studied in isolation. Based on this framework, we construct three corpora,
collectively referred to as DeFaBel, including a German-language corpus of
deceptive and non-deceptive arguments and a multilingual version in German and
English, each collected under varying conditions to account for belief change
and enable cross-linguistic analysis. Using these corpora, we evaluate commonly
reported linguistic cues of deception. Across all three DeFaBel variants, these
cues show negligible, statistically insignificant correlations with deception
labels, contrary to prior work that treats such cues as reliable indicators. We
further benchmark against other English deception datasets following similar
data collection protocols. While some show statistically significant
correlations, effect sizes remain low and, critically, the set of predictive
cues is inconsistent across datasets. We also evaluate deception detection
using feature-based models, pretrained language models, and instruction-tuned
large language models. While some models perform well on established deception
datasets, they consistently perform near chance on DeFaBel. Our findings
challenge the assumption that deception can be reliably inferred from
linguistic cues and call for rethinking how deception is studied and modeled in
NLP.

Method: 开发了Tianyi模型，基于多样中医语料库预训练和微调，采用渐进式学习方式吸收系统化中医知识，并建立TCMEval评估基准。

Result: Tianyi在中医考试、临床任务、领域问答和实际试验中表现出色，展示了其作为中医AI助手的潜力。

Conclusion: Tianyi填补了中医知识与实际应用间的鸿沟，为中医临床和研究提供了有效的AI支持。

Abstract: Natural medicines, particularly Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), are
gaining global recognition for their therapeutic potential in addressing human
symptoms and diseases. TCM, with its systematic theories and extensive
practical experience, provides abundant resources for healthcare. However, the
effective application of TCM requires precise syndrome diagnosis, determination
of treatment principles, and prescription formulation, which demand decades of
clinical expertise. Despite advancements in TCM-based decision systems, machine
learning, and deep learning research, limitations in data and single-objective
constraints hinder their practical application. In recent years, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in complex tasks, but lack
specialization in TCM and face significant challenges, such as too big model
scale to deploy and issues with hallucination. To address these challenges, we
introduce Tianyi with 7.6-billion-parameter LLM, a model scale proper and
specifically designed for TCM, pre-trained and fine-tuned on diverse TCM
corpora, including classical texts, expert treatises, clinical records, and
knowledge graphs. Tianyi is designed to assimilate interconnected and
systematic TCM knowledge through a progressive learning manner. Additionally,
we establish TCMEval, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, to assess LLMs in
TCM examinations, clinical tasks, domain-specific question-answering, and
real-world trials. The extensive evaluations demonstrate the significant
potential of Tianyi as an AI assistant in TCM clinical practice and research,
bridging the gap between TCM knowledge and practical application.

Conclusion: 位置偏移是评估记忆风险的重要维度，偏移敏感数据可减少记忆和退化。

Abstract: Large language models are known to memorize parts of their training data,
posing risk of copyright violations. To systematically examine this risk, we
pretrain language models (1B/3B/8B) from scratch on 83B tokens, mixing
web-scale data with public domain books used to simulate copyrighted content at
controlled frequencies at lengths at least ten times longer than prior work. We
thereby identified the offset effect, a phenomenon characterized by two key
findings: (1) verbatim memorization is most strongly triggered by short
prefixes drawn from the beginning of the context window, with memorization
decreasing counterintuitively as prefix length increases; and (2) a sharp
decline in verbatim recall when prefix begins offset from the initial tokens of
the context window. We attribute this to positional fragility: models rely
disproportionately on the earliest tokens in their context window as retrieval
anchors, making them sensitive to even slight shifts. We further observe that
when the model fails to retrieve memorized content, it often produces
degenerated text. Leveraging these findings, we show that shifting sensitive
data deeper into the context window suppresses both extractable memorization
and degeneration. Our results suggest that positional offset is a critical and
previously overlooked axis for evaluating memorization risks, since prior work
implicitly assumed uniformity by probing only from the beginning of training
sequences.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across diverse tasks and languages. In this study, we focus on
natural language understanding in three classical languages -- Sanskrit,
Ancient Greek and Latin -- to investigate the factors affecting cross-lingual
zero-shot generalization. First, we explore named entity recognition and
machine translation into English. While LLMs perform equal to or better than
fine-tuned baselines on out-of-domain data, smaller models often struggle,
especially with niche or abstract entity types. In addition, we concentrate on
Sanskrit by presenting a factoid question-answering (QA) dataset and show that
incorporating context via retrieval-augmented generation approach significantly
boosts performance. In contrast, we observe pronounced performance drops for
smaller LLMs across these QA tasks. These results suggest model scale as an
important factor influencing cross-lingual generalization. Assuming that models
used such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1 are not instruction fine-tuned on classical
languages, our findings provide insights into how LLMs may generalize on these
languages and their consequent utility in classical studies.

Abstract: While integrating external tools into large language models (LLMs) enhances
their ability to access real-time information and domain-specific services,
existing approaches focus narrowly on functional tool selection following user
instructions, overlooking the context-aware personalization in tool selection.
This oversight leads to suboptimal user satisfaction and inefficient tool
utilization, particularly when overlapping toolsets require nuanced selection
based on contextual factors. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolSpectrum, a
benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in personalized tool
utilization. Specifically, we formalize two key dimensions of personalization,
user profile and environmental factors, and analyze their individual and
synergistic impacts on tool utilization. Through extensive experiments on
ToolSpectrum, we demonstrate that personalized tool utilization significantly
improves user experience across diverse scenarios. However, even
state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit the limited ability to reason jointly about user
profiles and environmental factors, often prioritizing one dimension at the
expense of the other. Our findings underscore the necessity of context-aware
personalization in tool-augmented LLMs and reveal critical limitations for
current models. Our data and code are available at

Conclusion: SLED通过简化建模流程和消除离散化误差，为语音语言建模提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce SLED, an alternative approach to speech language modeling by
encoding speech waveforms into sequences of continuous latent representations
and modeling them autoregressively using an energy distance objective. The
energy distance offers an analytical measure of the distributional gap by
contrasting simulated and target samples, enabling efficient training to
capture the underlying continuous autoregressive distribution. By bypassing
reliance on residual vector quantization, SLED avoids discretization errors and
eliminates the need for the complicated hierarchical architectures common in
existing speech language models. It simplifies the overall modeling pipeline
while preserving the richness of speech information and maintaining inference
efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that SLED achieves strong performance
in both zero-shot and streaming speech synthesis, showing its potential for
broader applications in general-purpose speech language models.

Abstract: Recent works have revealed the great potential of speculative decoding in
accelerating the autoregressive generation process of large language models.
The success of these methods relies on the alignment between draft candidates
and the sampled outputs of the target model. Existing methods mainly achieve
draft-target alignment with training-based methods, e.g., EAGLE, Medusa,
involving considerable training costs. In this paper, we present a
training-free alignment-augmented speculative decoding algorithm. We propose
alignment sampling, which leverages output distribution obtained in the
prefilling phase to provide more aligned draft candidates. To further benefit
from high-quality but non-aligned draft candidates, we also introduce a simple
yet effective flexible verification strategy. Through an adaptive probability
threshold, our approach can improve generation accuracy while further improving
inference efficiency. Experiments on 8 datasets (including question answering,
summarization and code completion tasks) show that our approach increases the
average generation score by 3.3 points for the LLaMA3 model. Our method
achieves a mean acceptance length up to 2.39 and speed up generation by 2.23.

Abstract: Classical Chinese poetry is a vital and enduring part of Chinese literature,
conveying profound emotional resonance. Existing studies analyze sentiment
based on textual meanings, overlooking the unique rhythmic and visual features
inherent in poetry,especially since it is often recited and accompanied by
Chinese paintings. In this work, we propose a dialect-enhanced multimodal
framework for classical Chinese poetry sentiment analysis. We extract
sentence-level audio features from the poetry and incorporate audio from
multiple dialects,which may retain regional ancient Chinese phonetic features,
enriching the phonetic representation. Additionally, we generate sentence-level
visual features, and the multimodal features are fused with textual features
enhanced by LLM translation through multimodal contrastive representation
learning. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public
datasets, achieving at least 2.51% improvement in accuracy and 1.63% in macro
F1. We open-source the code to facilitate research in this area and provide
insights for general multimodal Chinese representation.

TLDR: SeedBench是首个针对种子科学的多任务基准，旨在评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在种子育种中的应用，揭示了LLMs与实际问题的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 种子科学对农业至关重要，但面临跨学科复杂性、高成本和资源不足的挑战，LLMs的应用因缺乏数字资源和标准化基准而受限。

Method: 开发SeedBench基准，模拟现代育种过程，评估26种领先的LLMs，包括专有、开源和领域微调模型。

Result: 评估结果显示LLMs在种子科学问题上的能力与实际需求存在显著差距。

Conclusion: SeedBench为LLMs在种子设计中的研究奠定了基础，并指出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Seed science is essential for modern agriculture, directly influencing crop
yields and global food security. However, challenges such as interdisciplinary
complexity and high costs with limited returns hinder progress, leading to a
shortage of experts and insufficient technological support. While large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise across various fields, their
application in seed science remains limited due to the scarcity of digital
resources, complex gene-trait relationships, and the lack of standardized
benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce SeedBench -- the first multi-task
benchmark specifically designed for seed science. Developed in collaboration
with domain experts, SeedBench focuses on seed breeding and simulates key
aspects of modern breeding processes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
26 leading LLMs, encompassing proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific
fine-tuned models. Our findings not only highlight the substantial gaps between
the power of LLMs and the real-world seed science problems, but also make a
foundational step for research on LLMs for seed design.

Motivation: 随着全球数字化发展，多语言情感检测成为重要研究方向，旨在解决SemEval-2025任务中的多标签情感检测和情感强度问题。

Method: 使用预训练多语言模型，包括微调BERT和指令调优生成LLM，并提出基础方法和成对方法处理多标签分类。

Result: 在10种语言中Top 4表现（印地语排名第1），情感强度任务中7种语言Top 5。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of global digitalization, users from different
countries increasingly rely on social media for information exchange. In this
context, multilingual multi-label emotion detection has emerged as a critical
research area. This study addresses SemEval-2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection. Our paper focuses on two sub-tracks of this task:
(1) Track A: Multi-label emotion detection, and (2) Track B: Emotion intensity.
To tackle multilingual challenges, we leverage pre-trained multilingual models
and focus on two architectures: (1) a fine-tuned BERT-based classification
model and (2) an instruction-tuned generative LLM. Additionally, we propose two
methods for handling multi-label classification: the base method, which maps an
input directly to all its corresponding emotion labels, and the pairwise
method, which models the relationship between the input text and each emotion
category individually. Experimental results demonstrate the strong
generalization ability of our approach in multilingual emotion recognition. In
Track A, our method achieved Top 4 performance across 10 languages, ranking 1st
in Hindi. In Track B, our approach also secured Top 5 performance in 7
languages, highlighting its simplicity and effectiveness\footnote{Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网既能连接社区，也可能传播仇恨与错误信息，需社会方法解决这一社会问题。

Method: 借鉴语言学研究的语言规划方法，将语言学与社会学知识应用于数字空间的反社会行为风险。

Result: 语言学家与NLP研究者可与社区、政策制定者合作，推动数字包容与消除数字鸿沟。

Conclusion: 语言学与NLP研究在解决数字空间社会问题中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: The advent of the internet has been both a blessing and a curse for once
marginalised communities. When used well, the internet can be used to connect
and establish communities crossing different intersections; however, it can
also be used as a tool to alienate people and communities as well as perpetuate
hate, misinformation, and disinformation especially on social media platforms.
We propose steering hate speech research and researchers away from pre-existing
computational solutions and consider social methods to inform social solutions
to address this social problem. In a similar way linguistics research can
inform language planning policy, linguists should apply what we know about
language and society to mitigate some of the emergent risks and dangers of
anti-social behaviour in digital spaces. We argue linguists and NLP researchers
can play a principle role in unleashing the social impact potential of
linguistics research working alongside communities, advocates, activists, and
policymakers to enable equitable digital inclusion and to close the digital
divide.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文研究了LLMs在复杂文本规划任务（如会议安排）中的表现，比较了闭源和开源模型生成程序代码的能力，发现编程通常优于规划，但生成的代码存在鲁棒性和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实生活中的文本规划任务（如会议安排）对LLMs提出了挑战，尤其是在高复杂度情况下。研究旨在评估闭源和开源模型在生成可执行程序代码方面的表现。

Method: 系统评估了闭源和开源模型，包括那些在推理时能根据复杂度扩展输出长度的模型，生成Python代码和约束满足问题求解器代码的能力。

Result: 研究发现编程通常优于规划，但生成的代码缺乏鲁棒性和效率，影响泛化能力。

Conclusion: 尽管编程在某些情况下表现更好，但生成的代码仍需改进以提高鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Real-life textual planning tasks such as meeting scheduling have posed much
challenge to LLMs especially when the complexity is high. While previous work
primarily studied auto-regressive generation of plans with closed-source
models, we systematically evaluate both closed- and open-source models,
including those that scales output length with complexity during inference, in
generating programs, which are executed to output the plan. We consider not
only standard Python code, but also the code to a constraint satisfaction
problem solver. Despite the algorithmic nature of the task, we show that
programming often but not always outperforms planning. Our detailed error
analysis also indicates a lack of robustness and efficiency in the generated
code that hinders generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: HeteroSpec是一种异构自适应的推测解码框架，通过动态优化计算资源分配，显著提升大型语言模型推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码是大型语言模型推理的标准方法，但其顺序性导致效率低下。现有推测解码算法未能充分利用语言复杂性的异构性，导致资源分配不优。

Method: HeteroSpec提出两种机制：1）基于累积元路径Top-K熵的指标识别可预测上下文；2）基于数据驱动熵分区的动态资源分配策略，实现自适应推测扩展与剪枝。

Result: 在五个公共基准和四个模型上，HeteroSpec平均加速4.26倍，优于现有EAGLE-3方法，且无需重新训练草案模型。

Conclusion: HeteroSpec为上下文感知的LLM推理加速提供了新范式，兼容其他加速技术，并在强草案模型下表现更优。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding, the standard approach for Large Language Model (LLM)
inference, remains a significant bottleneck due to its sequential nature. While
speculative decoding algorithms mitigate this inefficiency through parallel
verification, they fail to exploit the inherent heterogeneity in linguistic
complexity, a key factor leading to suboptimal resource allocation. We address
this by proposing HeteroSpec, a heterogeneity-adaptive speculative decoding
framework that dynamically optimizes computational resource allocation based on
linguistic context complexity. HeteroSpec introduces two key mechanisms: (1) A
novel cumulative meta-path Top-$K$ entropy metric for efficiently identifying
predictable contexts. (2) A dynamic resource allocation strategy based on
data-driven entropy partitioning, enabling adaptive speculative expansion and
pruning tailored to local context difficulty. Evaluated on five public
benchmarks and four models, HeteroSpec achieves an average speedup of
4.26$\times$. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art EAGLE-3 across
speedup rates, average acceptance length, and verification cost. Notably,
HeteroSpec requires no draft model retraining, incurs minimal overhead, and is
orthogonal to other acceleration techniques. It demonstrates enhanced
acceleration with stronger draft models, establishing a new paradigm for
context-aware LLM inference acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多关注通用人类偏好，忽略了多样且矛盾的个体偏好，缺乏针对个人偏好的数据集。

Method: 引入WikiPersona数据集，通过生成可验证的文本描述和偏好对齐，评估不同个性化方法。

Result: 推断个人偏好作为前缀的方法在偏好冲突时表现最佳，且能更公平地泛化到未见过的个体。

Conclusion: WikiPersona数据集和推断偏好前缀方法为个性化偏好对齐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Preference alignment has become a standard pipeline in finetuning models to
follow \emph{generic} human preferences. Majority of work seeks to optimize
model to produce responses that would be preferable \emph{on average},
simplifying the diverse and often \emph{contradicting} space of human
preferences. While research has increasingly focused on personalized alignment:
adapting models to individual user preferences, there is a lack of personalized
preference dataset which focus on nuanced individual-level preferences. To
address this, we introduce WikiPersona: the first fine-grained personalization
using well-documented, famous individuals. Our dataset challenges models to
align with these personas through an interpretable process: generating
verifiable textual descriptions of a persona's background and preferences in
addition to alignment. We systematically evaluate different personalization
approaches and find that as few-shot prompting with preferences and fine-tuning
fail to simultaneously ensure effectiveness and efficiency, using
\textit{inferred personal preferences} as prefixes enables effective
personalization, especially in topics where preferences clash while leading to
more equitable generalization across unseen personas.

Result: 在多跳QA数据集上实现10-30%的性能提升，接近商业LLMs水平。

Conclusion: ARENA具有强适应性和透明性，无需额外训练即可应用于新数据集。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive domains.
However, although RAG achieved successes across distinct domains, there are
still some unsolved challenges: 1) Effectiveness. Existing research mainly
focuses on developing more powerful RAG retrievers, but how to enhance the
generator's (LLM's) ability to utilize the retrieved information for reasoning
and generation? 2) Transparency. Most RAG methods ignore which retrieved
content actually contributes to the reasoning process, resulting in a lack of
interpretability and visibility. To address this, we propose ARENA
(Adaptive-Rewarded Evidence Navigation Agent), a transparent RAG generator
framework trained via reinforcement learning (RL) with our proposed rewards.
Based on the structured generation and adaptive reward calculation, our
RL-based training enables the model to identify key evidence, perform
structured reasoning, and generate answers with interpretable decision traces.
Applied to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, abundant experiments
with various RAG baselines demonstrate that our model achieves 10-30%
improvements on all multi-hop QA datasets, which is comparable with the SOTA
Commercially-developed LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1). Further analyses
show that ARENA has strong flexibility to be adopted on new datasets without
extra training. Our models and codes are publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音反馈在对话系统中对确保共同理解至关重要，但其韵律相似性及其在语音表征中的反映尚未充分研究。

Method: 采用三元比较任务，测量参与者对来自两个数据集的语音反馈的感知相似性，并分析不同语音表征的效果。

Result: 频谱和自监督语音表征在反映韵律相似性上优于基频特征，尤其是同一说话者的反馈。对比学习可进一步优化表征与人类感知的对齐。

Conclusion: 语音反馈的韵律相似性可通过特定语音表征有效捕捉，对比学习能进一步提升其与人类感知的一致性。

Abstract: Vocal feedback (e.g., `mhm', `yeah', `okay') is an important component of
spoken dialogue and is crucial to ensuring common ground in conversational
systems. The exact meaning of such feedback is conveyed through both lexical
and prosodic form. In this work, we investigate the perceived prosodic
similarity of vocal feedback with the same lexical form, and to what extent
existing speech representations reflect such similarities. A triadic comparison
task with recruited participants is used to measure perceived similarity of
feedback responses taken from two different datasets. We find that spectral and
self-supervised speech representations encode prosody better than extracted
pitch features, especially in the case of feedback from the same speaker. We
also find that it is possible to further condense and align the representations
to human perception through contrastive learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如Self-Consistency和Self-Correction）在SQL生成中存在局限性，需结合两者优势提升准确性。

Method: 提出CSC-SQL方法，选择高频输出并合并修订，使用GRPO算法微调模型。

Result: 在BIRD开发集上，3B和7B模型分别达到65.28%和69.19%的执行准确率。

Conclusion: CSC-SQL有效且通用，代码将开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
translating natural language questions about relational databases into SQL
queries. In particular, test-time scaling techniques such as Self-Consistency
and Self-Correction can enhance SQL generation accuracy by increasing
computational effort during inference. However, these methods have notable
limitations: Self-Consistency may select suboptimal outputs despite majority
votes, while Self-Correction typically addresses only syntactic errors. To
leverage the strengths of both approaches, we propose CSC-SQL, a novel method
that integrates Self-Consistency and Self-Correction. CSC-SQL selects the two
most frequently occurring outputs from parallel sampling and feeds them into a
merge revision model for correction. Additionally, we employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to fine-tune both the SQL generation and
revision models via reinforcement learning, significantly enhancing output
quality. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of
CSC-SQL. On the BIRD development set, our 3B model achieves 65.28% execution
accuracy, while the 7B model achieves 69.19%. The code will be open sourced at

Motivation: 随着数据增长，分类法扩展变得重要，但现有方法存在表示限制、噪声问题和上下文效率低的挑战。

Method: LORex通过排序和分块候选词，结合层次推理，迭代优化选择，减少噪声并提高效率。

Result: 在四个基准测试和十二个基线方法中，LORex将准确率提高了12%，Wu & Palmer相似度提高了5%。

Conclusion: LORex通过结合判别和生成方法，显著提升了分类法扩展的性能和效率。

Abstract: Taxonomies are hierarchical knowledge graphs crucial for recommendation
systems, and web applications. As data grows, expanding taxonomies is
essential, but existing methods face key challenges: (1) discriminative models
struggle with representation limits and generalization, while (2) generative
methods either process all candidates at once, introducing noise and exceeding
context limits, or discard relevant entities by selecting noisy candidates. We
propose LORex ($\textbf{L}$ineage-$\textbf{O}$riented $\textbf{Re}$asoning for
Taxonomy E$\textbf{x}$pansion), a plug-and-play framework that combines
discriminative ranking and generative reasoning for efficient taxonomy
expansion. Unlike prior methods, LORex ranks and chunks candidate terms into
batches, filtering noise and iteratively refining selections by reasoning
candidates' hierarchy to ensure contextual efficiency. Extensive experiments
across four benchmarks and twelve baselines show that LORex improves accuracy
by 12% and Wu & Palmer similarity by 5% over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在新闻推荐系统中的广泛应用，其传播虚假信息的风险引发关注。视觉内容在人类中能增强信息的可信度和分享性，但对VLMs的影响尚不明确。

Method: 研究引入两种方法：一种基于越狱启发的提示策略，模拟反社会特质和政治倾向的用户行为；另一种是多模态数据集，包含事实核查的政治新闻及其图像和真实性标签。

Result: 实验显示，图像使虚假新闻的分享率增加15.0%，而真实新闻仅增加4.8%。不同人格特质（如黑暗三联征）和政治倾向（如共和党）显著影响模型行为。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态模型行为中的新风险，呼吁开发针对个性化AI系统的评估框架和缓解策略。Claude-3-Haiku是唯一对视觉虚假信息表现出鲁棒性的模型。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly integrated into news recommendation
systems, raising concerns about their role in spreading misinformation. In
humans, visual content is known to boost credibility and shareability of
information, yet its effect on vision-language models (VLMs) remains unclear.
We present the first study examining how images influence VLMs' propensity to
reshare news content, whether this effect varies across model families, and how
persona conditioning and content attributes modulate this behavior. To support
this analysis, we introduce two methodological contributions: a
jailbreaking-inspired prompting strategy that elicits resharing decisions from
VLMs while simulating users with antisocial traits and political alignments;
and a multimodal dataset of fact-checked political news from PolitiFact, paired
with corresponding images and ground-truth veracity labels. Experiments across
model families reveal that image presence increases resharing rates by 4.8% for
true news and 15.0% for false news. Persona conditioning further modulates this
effect: Dark Triad traits amplify resharing of false news, whereas
Republican-aligned profiles exhibit reduced veracity sensitivity. Of all the
tested models, only Claude-3-Haiku demonstrates robustness to visual
misinformation. These findings highlight emerging risks in multimodal model
behavior and motivate the development of tailored evaluation frameworks and
mitigation strategies for personalized AI systems. Code and dataset are

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了Reasoning Boundary Framework++（RBF++），用于解决Chain-of-Thought（CoT）推理在现实应用中的两大挑战：量化评估和优化可测量边界，以及处理不可测量边界（如多模态感知）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CoT推理缺乏量化指标和可操作指南，且无法评估不可测量能力（如多模态感知）。

Method: 提出RBF++框架，定义推理边界（RB）并设计组合定律；引入常数假设和推理边界划分机制处理不可测量边界。

Result: 在13个任务和38个模型上的实验验证了框架的可行性，并评估了10种CoT策略。

Conclusion: RBF++为理解和优化LLM推理边界提供了新视角，推动了相关研究。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has proven effective in enhancing large
language models (LLMs) on complex tasks, spurring research into its underlying
mechanisms. However, two primary challenges remain for real-world applications:
(1) the lack of quantitative metrics and actionable guidelines for evaluating
and optimizing measurable boundaries of CoT capability, and (2) the absence of
methods to assess boundaries of unmeasurable CoT capability, such as multimodal
perception. To address these gaps, we introduce the Reasoning Boundary
Framework++ (RBF++). To tackle the first challenge, we define the reasoning
boundary (RB) as the maximum limit of CoT performance. We also propose a
combination law for RBs, enabling quantitative analysis and offering actionable
guidance across various CoT tasks. For the second challenge, particularly in
multimodal scenarios, we introduce a constant assumption, which replaces
unmeasurable RBs with scenario-specific constants. Additionally, we propose the
reasoning boundary division mechanism, which divides unmeasurable RBs into two
sub-boundaries, facilitating the quantification and optimization of both
unmeasurable domain knowledge and multimodal perception capabilities. Extensive
experiments involving 38 models across 13 tasks validate the feasibility of our
framework in cross-modal settings. Additionally, we evaluate 10 CoT strategies,
offer insights into optimization and decay from two complementary perspectives,
and expand evaluation benchmarks for measuring RBs in LLM reasoning. We hope
this work advances the understanding of RBs and optimization strategies in
LLMs. Code and data are available at

TLDR: GUARD框架通过生成时动态遗忘技术，避免微调对模型性能的负面影响，实现选择性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）需要选择性遗忘特定知识以确保安全与合规，但现有方法通常以牺牲整体性能为代价。

Method: 提出GUARD框架，结合提示分类器和动态惩罚机制，在生成时检测并过滤遗忘目标。

Result: 在多个任务中，GUARD表现出色，几乎不影响模型通用能力，实现了遗忘与效用的平衡。

Conclusion: GUARD为LLMs提供了一种高效、安全的生成时遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
memorizing vast amounts of knowledge across diverse domains. However, the
ability to selectively forget specific knowledge is critical for ensuring the
safety and compliance of deployed models. Existing unlearning efforts typically
fine-tune the model with resources such as forget data, retain data, and a
calibration model. These additional gradient steps blur the decision boundary
between forget and retain knowledge, making unlearning often at the expense of
overall performance. To avoid the negative impact of fine-tuning, it would be
better to unlearn solely at inference time by safely guarding the model against
generating responses related to the forget target, without destroying the
fluency of text generation. In this work, we propose Generation-time Unlearning
via Adaptive Restriction and Detection (GUARD), a framework that enables
dynamic unlearning during LLM generation. Specifically, we first employ a
prompt classifier to detect unlearning targets and extract the corresponding
forbidden token. We then dynamically penalize and filter candidate tokens
during generation using a combination of token matching and semantic matching,
effectively preventing the model from leaking the forgotten content.
Experimental results on copyright content unlearning tasks over the Harry
Potter dataset and the MUSE benchmark, as well as entity unlearning tasks on
the TOFU dataset, demonstrate that GUARD achieves strong forget quality across
various tasks while causing almost no degradation to the LLM's general
capabilities, striking an excellent trade-off between forgetting and utility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注单轮或无状态交互，忽略了多轮应用中工具交互的状态化特性。

Method: 提出DialogTool数据集和VirtualMobile环境，评估语言模型在工具创建、工具利用和角色一致响应三个阶段的表现。

Result: 对13种开源和闭源LLM的综合评估显示，现有最先进模型在多轮工具使用中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在多轮状态化工具交互中仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks that assess Language Models (LMs) as Language Agents
(LAs) for tool use primarily focus on stateless, single-turn interactions or
partial evaluations, such as tool selection in a single turn, overlooking the
inherent stateful nature of interactions in multi-turn applications. To fulfill
this gap, we propose \texttt{DialogTool}, a multi-turn dialogue dataset with
stateful tool interactions considering the whole life cycle of tool use, across
six key tasks in three stages: 1) \textit{tool creation}; 2) \textit{tool
utilization}: tool awareness, tool selection, tool execution; and 3)
\textit{role-consistent response}: response generation and role play.
Furthermore, we build \texttt{VirtualMobile} -- an embodied virtual mobile
evaluation environment to simulate API calls and assess the robustness of the
created APIs\footnote{We will use tools and APIs alternatively, there are no
significant differences between them in this paper.}. Taking advantage of these
artifacts, we conduct comprehensive evaluation on 13 distinct open- and
closed-source LLMs and provide detailed analysis at each stage, revealing that
the existing state-of-the-art LLMs still cannot perform well to use tools over

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的数据集生成框架，结合上下文推理和副语言信息，用于训练更强大的语音-LLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音-LLM在上下文推理和副语言理解方面能力有限，缺乏涵盖这两方面的QA数据集。

Method: 提出了一种基于伪副语言标签的数据浓缩方法和LLM生成的上下文副语言QA（CPQA）框架。

Result: 验证了框架的有效性，并揭示了语音-LLM在共情推理任务中的局限性。

Conclusion: 该框架是首创的，有望用于训练具有副语言推理能力的更鲁棒的语音-LLM。

Abstract: Current speech-LLMs exhibit limited capability in contextual reasoning
alongside paralinguistic understanding, primarily due to the lack of
Question-Answer (QA) datasets that cover both aspects. We propose a novel
framework for dataset generation from in-the-wild speech data, that integrates
contextual reasoning with paralinguistic information. It consists of a pseudo
paralinguistic label-based data condensation of in-the-wild speech and
LLM-based Contextual Paralinguistic QA (CPQA) generation. The effectiveness is
validated by a strong correlation in evaluations of the Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct
model on a dataset created by our framework and human-generated CPQA dataset.
The results also reveal the speech-LLM's limitations in handling empathetic
reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for such datasets and more robust
models. The proposed framework is first of its kind and has potential in
training more robust speech-LLMs with paralinguistic reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的发展，传统人工评估效率低下，自动评估成为趋势。然而，现有LLM评估模型在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出EIS-GRPO算法，用于训练评估模型以解决位置偏差问题；构建ReasoningJudgeBench基准；训练7B参数的J4R模型。

Result: J4R在JudgeBench和ReasoningJudgeBench上表现优于GPT-4o和其他小型评估模型，性能提升6.7%和9%。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习训练的J4R模型显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的评估能力，为自动评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: To keep pace with the increasing pace of large language models (LLM)
development, model output evaluation has transitioned away from time-consuming
human evaluation to automatic evaluation, where LLMs themselves are tasked with
assessing and critiquing other model outputs. LLM-as-judge models are a class
of generative evaluators that excel in evaluating relatively simple domains,
like chat quality, but struggle in reasoning intensive domains where model
responses contain more substantive and challenging content. To remedy existing
judge shortcomings, we explore training judges with reinforcement learning
(RL). We make three key contributions: (1) We propose the Equivalent Initial
State Group Relative Policy Optimization (EIS-GRPO) algorithm, which allows us
to train our judge to be robust to positional biases that arise in more complex
evaluation settings. (2) We introduce ReasoningJudgeBench, a benchmark that
evaluates judges in diverse reasoning settings not covered by prior work. (3)
We train Judge for Reasoning (J4R), a 7B judge trained with EIS-GRPO that
outperforms GPT-4o and the next best small judge by 6.7% and 9%, matching or
exceeding the performance of larger GRPO-trained judges on both JudgeBench and
ReasoningJudgeBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估者具有可扩展性和成本效益，但其可靠性和安全性，尤其是对抗性操纵的鲁棒性，仍存在重大隐患。

Method: 论文提出了两种攻击策略：比较性削弱攻击（CUA）和理由操纵攻击（JMA），并使用GCG优化方法生成对抗性后缀进行实验。

Result: 实验显示，CUA的攻击成功率超过30%，JMA也表现出显著效果，表明当前LLM-as-a-Judge系统存在严重漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM-as-a-Judge系统的重大脆弱性，强调了开发防御机制和进一步研究对抗性评估的必要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as evaluators
(LLM-as-a-Judge) for assessing the quality of machine-generated text. This
paradigm offers scalability and cost-effectiveness compared to human
annotation. However, the reliability and security of such systems, particularly
their robustness against adversarial manipulations, remain critical concerns.
This paper investigates the vulnerability of LLM-as-a-Judge architectures to
prompt-injection attacks, where malicious inputs are designed to compromise the
judge's decision-making process. We formalize two primary attack strategies:
Comparative Undermining Attack (CUA), which directly targets the final decision
output, and Justification Manipulation Attack (JMA), which aims to alter the
model's generated reasoning. Using the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG)
optimization method, we craft adversarial suffixes appended to one of the
responses being compared. Experiments conducted on the MT-Bench Human Judgments
dataset with open-source instruction-tuned LLMs (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and
Falcon3-3B-Instruct) demonstrate significant susceptibility. The CUA achieves
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 30\%, while JMA also shows notable
effectiveness. These findings highlight substantial vulnerabilities in current
LLM-as-a-Judge systems, underscoring the need for robust defense mechanisms and
further research into adversarial evaluation and trustworthiness in LLM-based
assessment frameworks.

TLDR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在长代码上下文中的推理能力，区分了词汇代码回忆和语义代码回忆，并提出SemTrace技术衡量语义回忆。研究发现LLM在代码片段位于输入上下文中间时推理准确性显著下降，且词汇回忆和语义回忆存在脱节。

Motivation: 探讨LLM在长代码上下文中的推理能力及其与回忆能力的关系，以揭示现有基准测试可能低估了LLM利用上下文信息的挑战。

Method: 提出SemTrace技术衡量语义回忆，并量化现有基准测试中的语义回忆敏感性。评估了先进LLM在代码推理中的表现。

Result: LLM在代码片段位于输入上下文中间时推理准确性下降，词汇回忆和语义回忆表现不同，现有基准测试可能低估语义回忆敏感性。

Conclusion: LLM在长代码上下文中的推理能力存在局限性，词汇回忆和语义回忆机制不同，需改进基准测试以更准确评估LLM性能。

Abstract: Although modern Large Language Models (LLMs) support extremely large
contexts, their effectiveness in utilizing long context for code reasoning
remains unclear. This paper investigates LLM reasoning ability over code
snippets within large repositories and how it relates to their recall ability.
Specifically, we differentiate between lexical code recall (verbatim retrieval)
and semantic code recall (remembering what the code does). To measure semantic
recall, we propose SemTrace, a code reasoning technique where the impact of
specific statements on output is attributable and unpredictable. We also
present a method to quantify semantic recall sensitivity in existing
benchmarks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a significant drop
in code reasoning accuracy as a code snippet approaches the middle of the input
context, particularly with techniques requiring high semantic recall like
SemTrace. Moreover, we find that lexical recall varies by granularity, with
models excelling at function retrieval but struggling with line-by-line recall.
Notably, a disconnect exists between lexical and semantic recall, suggesting
different underlying mechanisms. Finally, our findings indicate that current
code reasoning benchmarks may exhibit low semantic recall sensitivity,
potentially underestimating LLM challenges in leveraging in-context
information.

Motivation: 开发者通过自然语言提示LLM时，提示常未充分指定用户需求，导致性能不稳定。

Method: 分析提示未充分指定的影响，提出需求感知提示优化机制。

Result: 未充分指定的提示性能下降20%，优化机制平均提升4.8%。

Conclusion: 需结合需求发现、评估和监控，全面管理提示未充分指定问题。

Abstract: Building LLM-powered software requires developers to communicate their
requirements through natural language, but developer prompts are frequently
underspecified, failing to fully capture many user-important requirements. In
this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of prompt underspecification,
showing that while LLMs can often (41.1%) guess unspecified requirements by
default, such behavior is less robust: Underspecified prompts are 2x more
likely to regress over model or prompt changes, sometimes with accuracy drops
by more than 20%. We then demonstrate that simply adding more requirements to a
prompt does not reliably improve performance, due to LLMs' limited
instruction-following capabilities and competing constraints, and standard
prompt optimizers do not offer much help. To address this, we introduce novel
requirements-aware prompt optimization mechanisms that can improve performance
by 4.8% on average over baselines that naively specify everything in the
prompt. Beyond prompt optimization, we envision that effectively managing
prompt underspecification requires a broader process, including proactive
requirements discovery, evaluation, and monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs对所有查询都进行复杂推理导致的低效问题，探索LLMs是否能学会何时思考。

Method: 提出Thinkless框架，采用强化学习训练，使用<short>和<think>控制令牌，核心是DeGRPO算法，分解学习目标为控制令牌损失和响应损失。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Thinkless将长链推理使用量减少50%-90%，显著提升效率。

Conclusion: Thinkless通过自适应推理模式选择，有效平衡了推理效率与准确性。

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models, capable of extended chain-of-thought reasoning,
have demonstrated remarkable performance on tasks requiring complex logical
inference. However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results
in substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems
admit straightforward solutions. This motivates an open question: Can LLMs
learn when to think? To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable
framework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and
long-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability.
Thinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two
control tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed
reasoning. At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy
Optimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of
hybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the
selection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the
accuracy of the generated answers. This decoupled formulation enables
fine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing
training and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO.
Empirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and
GSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% -
90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型缺乏可控性和可解释性，且目标狭窄，难以泛化到更广泛的下游任务。

Method: 提出R3框架，具有维度无关、可泛化且提供可解释评分的特点。

Result: R3支持更透明和灵活的语言模型评估，并能与多样化的人类价值观和用例对齐。

Conclusion: R3为奖励建模提供了更优的解决方案，其模型、数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning language model outputs with human
preferences, yet existing approaches often lack both controllability and
interpretability. These models are typically optimized for narrow objectives,
limiting their generalizability to broader downstream tasks. Moreover, their
scalar outputs are difficult to interpret without contextual reasoning. To
address these limitations, we introduce R3, a novel reward modeling framework
that is rubric-agnostic, generalizable across evaluation dimensions, and
provides interpretable, reasoned score assignments. R3 enables more transparent
and flexible evaluation of language models, supporting robust alignment with
diverse human values and use cases. Our models, data, and code are available as

Motivation: 传统直接评分方法在评估多模态响应时缺乏解释性和性能，因此需要一种结合推理能力的评估范式。

Result: MR. Judge-7B在VL-RewardBench上超越GPT-4o 9.9%，在MM-Vet推理时性能提升7.7%。

Conclusion: MR. Judge通过推理增强的评估范式显著提升了MLLMs的评估能力和解释性。

Abstract: The paradigm of using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) as evaluative judges has emerged as an effective
approach in RLHF and inference-time scaling. In this work, we propose
Multimodal Reasoner as a Judge (MR. Judge), a paradigm for empowering
general-purpose MLLMs judges with strong reasoning capabilities. Instead of
directly assigning scores for each response, we formulate the judgement process
as a reasoning-inspired multiple-choice problem. Specifically, the judge model
first conducts deliberate reasoning covering different aspects of the responses
and eventually selects the best response from them. This reasoning process not
only improves the interpretibility of the judgement, but also greatly enhances
the performance of MLLM judges. To cope with the lack of questions with scored
responses, we propose the following strategy to achieve automatic annotation:
1) Reverse Response Candidates Synthesis: starting from a supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) dataset, we treat the original response as the best candidate
and prompt the MLLM to generate plausible but flawed negative candidates. 2)
Text-based reasoning extraction: we carefully design a data synthesis pipeline
for distilling the reasoning capability from a text-based reasoning model,
which is adopted to enable the MLLM judges to regain complex reasoning ability
via warm up supervised fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our MR. Judge
is effective across a wide range of tasks. Specifically, our MR. Judge-7B
surpasses GPT-4o by 9.9% on VL-RewardBench, and improves performance on MM-Vet
during inference-time scaling by up to 7.7%.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务中表现优异，但冗长的思考过程增加了推理开销。研究发现，对于简单任务，跳过思考直接生成解决方案（NoThinking）更高效且性能更好。

Conclusion: AdaptThink通过自适应思考模式选择，有效平衡了推理质量与效率，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models have achieved impressive performance on
various tasks by employing human-like deep thinking. However, the lengthy
thinking process substantially increases inference overhead, making efficiency
a critical bottleneck. In this work, we first demonstrate that NoThinking,
which prompts the reasoning model to skip thinking and directly generate the
final solution, is a better choice for relatively simple tasks in terms of both
performance and efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose AdaptThink, a novel
RL algorithm to teach reasoning models to choose the optimal thinking mode
adaptively based on problem difficulty. Specifically, AdaptThink features two
core components: (1) a constrained optimization objective that encourages the
model to choose NoThinking while maintaining the overall performance; (2) an
importance sampling strategy that balances Thinking and NoThinking samples
during on-policy training, thereby enabling cold start and allowing the model
to explore and exploit both thinking modes throughout the training process. Our
experiments indicate that AdaptThink significantly reduces the inference costs
while further enhancing performance. Notably, on three math datasets,
AdaptThink reduces the average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B
by 53% and improves its accuracy by 2.4%, highlighting the promise of adaptive
thinking-mode selection for optimizing the balance between reasoning quality
and efficiency. Our codes and models are available at

Result: 人类感知不一致且依赖有限线索，LLMs特征更丰富且接近临床模式，但两者均易漏诊。

Conclusion: 研究框架帮助非专家更准确识别语言标志，提升痴呆症早期察觉能力。

Abstract: Cognitive decline often surfaces in language years before diagnosis. It is
frequently non-experts, such as those closest to the patient, who first sense a
change and raise concern. As LLMs become integrated into daily communication
and used over prolonged periods, it may even be an LLM that notices something
is off. But what exactly do they notice--and should be noticing--when making
that judgment? This paper investigates how dementia is perceived through
language by non-experts. We presented transcribed picture descriptions to
non-expert humans and LLMs, asking them to intuitively judge whether each text
was produced by someone healthy or with dementia. We introduce an explainable
method that uses LLMs to extract high-level, expert-guided features
representing these picture descriptions, and use logistic regression to model
human and LLM perceptions and compare with clinical diagnoses. Our analysis
reveals that human perception of dementia is inconsistent and relies on a
narrow, and sometimes misleading, set of cues. LLMs, by contrast, draw on a
richer, more nuanced feature set that aligns more closely with clinical
patterns. Still, both groups show a tendency toward false negatives, frequently
overlooking dementia cases. Through our interpretable framework and the
insights it provides, we hope to help non-experts better recognize the
linguistic signs that matter.

Conclusion: SMOTExT为数据保护和高效学习提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: Data scarcity and class imbalance are persistent challenges in training
robust NLP models, especially in specialized domains or low-resource settings.
We propose a novel technique, SMOTExT, that adapts the idea of Synthetic
Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) to textual data. Our method generates new
synthetic examples by interpolating between BERT-based embeddings of two
existing examples and then decoding the resulting latent point into text with
xRAG architecture. By leveraging xRAG's cross-modal retrieval-generation
framework, we can effectively turn interpolated vectors into coherent text.
While this is preliminary work supported by qualitative outputs only, the
method shows strong potential for knowledge distillation and data augmentation
in few-shot settings. Notably, our approach also shows promise for
privacy-preserving machine learning: in early experiments, training models
solely on generated data achieved comparable performance to models trained on
the original dataset. This suggests a viable path toward safe and effective
learning under data protection constraints.

Method: 通过合成数据集和真实世界图表构建的ChartMuseum基准测试，评估模型在多种推理类型上的表现，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 人类准确率达93%，而最佳模型Gemini-2.5-Pro仅63.0%，开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct仅38.5%；视觉推理问题中模型性能下降35%-55%。

Conclusion: ChartMuseum揭示了LVLMs在视觉推理上的显著不足，为未来模型改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a unique challenge for large vision-language
models (LVLMs), as it requires the integration of sophisticated textual and
visual reasoning capabilities. However, current LVLMs exhibit a notable
imbalance between these skills, falling short on visual reasoning that is
difficult to perform in text. We conduct a case study using a synthetic dataset
solvable only through visual reasoning and show that model performance degrades
significantly with increasing visual complexity, while human performance
remains robust. We then introduce ChartMuseum, a new Chart Question Answering
(QA) benchmark containing 1,162 expert-annotated questions spanning multiple
reasoning types, curated from real-world charts across 184 sources,
specifically built to evaluate complex visual and textual reasoning. Unlike
prior chart understanding benchmarks -- where frontier models perform similarly
and near saturation -- our benchmark exposes a substantial gap between model
and human performance, while effectively differentiating model capabilities:
although humans achieve 93% accuracy, the best-performing model Gemini-2.5-Pro
attains only 63.0%, and the leading open-source LVLM Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
achieves only 38.5%. Moreover, on questions requiring primarily visual
reasoning, all models experience a 35%-55% performance drop from
text-reasoning-heavy question performance. Lastly, our qualitative error
analysis reveals specific categories of visual reasoning that are challenging
for current LVLMs.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在控制生成内容长度方面比上下文学习或离散信号方法更可靠。

Conclusion: 连续控制信号为语言模型的行为控制提供了更灵活和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning language models with user intent is becoming increasingly relevant
to enhance user experience. This calls for designing methods that can allow
users to control the properties of the language that LMs generate. For example,
controlling the length of the generation, the complexity of the language that
gets chosen, the sentiment, tone, etc. Most existing work attempts to integrate
users' control by conditioning LM generations on natural language prompts or
discrete control signals, which are often brittle and hard to scale. In this
work, we are interested in \textit{continuous} control signals, ones that exist
along a spectrum that can't easily be captured in a natural language prompt or
via existing techniques in conditional generation. Through a case study in
controlling the precise response-length of generations produced by LMs, we
demonstrate how after fine-tuning, behaviors of language models can be
controlled via continuous signals -- as vectors that are interpolated between a
"low" and a "high" token embedding. Our method more reliably exerts
response-length control than in-context learning methods or fine-tuning methods
that represent the control signal as a discrete signal. Our full open-sourced
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/vsamuel2003/CIE.

correctly label known categories and detect novel, unseen classes. In this
paper, we propose a plug and play framework for O3S. By modeling the
segmentation pipeline as a conditional Markov chain, we derive a novel
regularizer term dubbed Conditional Channel Capacity Maximization (3CM), that
maximizes the mutual information between features and predictions conditioned
on each class. When incorporated into standard loss functions, 3CM encourages
the encoder to retain richer, label-dependent features, thereby enhancing the
network's ability to distinguish and segment previously unseen categories.
Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of proposed method on detecting
unseen objects. We further outline future directions for dynamic open-world
adaptation and efficient information-theoretic estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战性能提升必然优化内部表征的观点，探索不同训练方法对网络内部结构的影响。

Method: 比较进化网络和SGD训练网络在生成单图像任务中的表现，可视化神经元行为。

Result: SGD网络表现出分裂纠缠表征（FER），而进化网络接近统一分解表征（UFR）。

Conclusion: 理解并缓解FER可能对表征学习的未来至关重要，因其可能影响模型的泛化、创造力和持续学习能力。

Abstract: Much of the excitement in modern AI is driven by the observation that scaling
up existing systems leads to better performance. But does better performance
necessarily imply better internal representations? While the representational
optimist assumes it must, this position paper challenges that view. We compare
neural networks evolved through an open-ended search process to networks
trained via conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the simple task
of generating a single image. This minimal setup offers a unique advantage:
each hidden neuron's full functional behavior can be easily visualized as an
image, thus revealing how the network's output behavior is internally
constructed neuron by neuron. The result is striking: while both networks
produce the same output behavior, their internal representations differ
dramatically. The SGD-trained networks exhibit a form of disorganization that
we term fractured entangled representation (FER). Interestingly, the evolved
networks largely lack FER, even approaching a unified factored representation
(UFR). In large models, FER may be degrading core model capacities like
generalization, creativity, and (continual) learning. Therefore, understanding
and mitigating FER could be critical to the future of representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面纹理定位是一种低成本、高精度的定位方法，适用于动态环境且无需环境改造。现有BoW系统在精度和速度上有改进空间。

Method: 采用近似k均值（AKM）词汇和软分配，利用地面纹理定位的固定方向和尺度约束，分别设计了高精度和高速度的算法版本。

Result: 通过消融实验验证了改进效果，显著提升了全局定位和闭环检测的精度与召回率。

Conclusion: 该方法可直接替代现有BoW系统，无需修改流程即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Ground texture localization using a downward-facing camera offers a low-cost,
high-precision localization solution that is robust to dynamic environments and
requires no environmental modification. We present a significantly improved
bag-of-words (BoW) image retrieval system for ground texture localization,
achieving substantially higher accuracy for global localization and higher
precision and recall for loop closure detection in SLAM. Our approach leverages
an approximate $k$-means (AKM) vocabulary with soft assignment, and exploits
the consistent orientation and constant scale constraints inherent to ground
texture localization. Identifying the different needs of global localization
vs. loop closure detection for SLAM, we present both high-accuracy and
high-speed versions of our algorithm. We test the effect of each of our
proposed improvements through an ablation study and demonstrate our method's
effectiveness for both global localization and loop closure detection. With
numerous ground texture localization systems already using BoW, our method can
readily replace other generic BoW systems in their pipeline and immediately
improve their results.

Motivation: 现有激活函数在隐式神经表示中存在频谱偏差、噪声鲁棒性差和难以同时捕获局部与全局特征等问题，且需要手动调参。

Method: 提出BandRC激活函数，并结合任务特定模型从信号中提取深度先验知识以调整激活函数。

Result: 在图像重建、去噪、超分辨率、修复和3D形状重建等任务中，BandRC显著优于现有方法，PSNR提升显著。

Conclusion: BandRC是一种高效的激活函数，能够显著提升隐式神经表示的性能，适用于多种计算机视觉任务。

Abstract: In recent years, implicit neural representations(INRs) have gained popularity
in the computer vision community. This is mainly due to the strong performance
of INRs in many computer vision tasks. These networks can extract a continuous
signal representation given a discrete signal representation. In previous
studies, it has been repeatedly shown that INR performance has a strong
correlation with the activation functions used in its multilayer perceptrons.
Although numerous activation functions have been proposed that are competitive
with one another, they share some common set of challenges such as spectral
bias(Lack of sensitivity to high-frequency content in signals), limited
robustness to signal noise and difficulties in simultaneous capturing both
local and global features. and furthermore, the requirement for manual
parameter tuning. To address these issues, we introduce a novel activation
function, Band Shifted Raised Cosine Activated Implicit Neural Networks
\textbf{(BandRC)} tailored to enhance signal representation capacity further.
We also incorporate deep prior knowledge extracted from the signal to adjust
the activation functions through a task-specific model. Through a mathematical
analysis and a series of experiments which include image reconstruction (with a
+8.93 dB PSNR improvement over the nearest counterpart), denoising (with a
+0.46 dB increase in PSNR), super-resolution (with a +1.03 dB improvement over
the nearest State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) method for 6X super-resolution),
inpainting, and 3D shape reconstruction we demonstrate the dominance of BandRC
over existing state of the art activation functions.

Conclusion: DPSeg通过双提示框架有效解决了领域差距和浅层特征问题，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to segment images into distinct
semantic regions for both seen and unseen categories at the pixel level.
Current methods utilize text embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models
like CLIP but struggle with the inherent domain gap between image and text
embeddings, even after extensive alignment during training. Additionally,
relying solely on deep text-aligned features limits shallow-level feature
guidance, which is crucial for detecting small objects and fine details,
ultimately reducing segmentation accuracy. To address these limitations, we
propose a dual prompting framework, DPSeg, for this task. Our approach combines
dual-prompt cost volume generation, a cost volume-guided decoder, and a
semantic-guided prompt refinement strategy that leverages our dual prompting
scheme to mitigate alignment issues in visual prompt generation. By
incorporating visual embeddings from a visual prompt encoder, our approach
reduces the domain gap between text and image embeddings while providing
multi-level guidance through shallow features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches on multiple public datasets.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image generation, using synthetically
generated data seldom brings a significant boost in performance for supervised
learning. Oftentimes, synthetic datasets do not faithfully recreate the data
distribution of real data, i.e., they lack the fidelity or diversity needed for
effective downstream model training. While previous work has employed few-shot
guidance to address this issue, existing methods still fail to capture and
generate features unique to specific real images. In this paper, we introduce a
novel dataset generation framework named LoFT, LoRA-Fused Training-data
Generation with Few-shot Guidance. Our method fine-tunes LoRA weights on
individual real images and fuses them at inference time, producing synthetic
images that combine the features of real images for improved diversity and
fidelity of generated data. We evaluate the synthetic data produced by LoFT on
10 datasets, using 8 to 64 real images per class as guidance and scaling up to
1000 images per class. Our experiments show that training on LoFT-generated
data consistently outperforms other synthetic dataset methods, significantly
increasing accuracy as the dataset size increases. Additionally, our analysis
demonstrates that LoFT generates datasets with high fidelity and sufficient
diversity, which contribute to the performance improvement. The code is

Method: 基于结构-细节去噪先验分析特征冗余，提出动态视觉令牌合并、压缩比调整和提示重加权技术。

Result: 实验表明，SDTM在多种架构和数据集上实现1.55倍加速，且图像质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: SDTM为扩散变换器提供了一种高效的后训练压缩方案，显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have shown exceptional performance in visual
generation but incur high computational costs. Token reduction techniques that
compress models by sharing the denoising process among similar tokens have been
introduced. However, existing approaches neglect the denoising priors of the
diffusion models, leading to suboptimal acceleration and diminished image
quality. This study proposes a novel concept: attend to prune feature
redundancies in areas not attended by the diffusion process. We analyze the
location and degree of feature redundancies based on the structure-then-detail
denoising priors. Subsequently, we introduce SDTM, a structure-then-detail
token merging approach that dynamically compresses feature redundancies.
Specifically, we design dynamic visual token merging, compression ratio
adjusting, and prompt reweighting for different stages. Served in a
post-training way, the proposed method can be integrated seamlessly into any
DiT architecture. Extensive experiments across various backbones, schedulers,
and datasets showcase the superiority of our method, for example, it achieves
1.55 times acceleration with negligible impact on image quality. Project page:

Conclusion: 发布EgoDex数据集以推动机器人、计算机视觉和基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Imitation learning for manipulation has a well-known data scarcity problem.
Unlike natural language and 2D computer vision, there is no Internet-scale
corpus of data for dexterous manipulation. One appealing option is egocentric
human video, a passively scalable data source. However, existing large-scale
datasets such as Ego4D do not have native hand pose annotations and do not
focus on object manipulation. To this end, we use Apple Vision Pro to collect
EgoDex: the largest and most diverse dataset of dexterous human manipulation to
date. EgoDex has 829 hours of egocentric video with paired 3D hand and finger
tracking data collected at the time of recording, where multiple calibrated
cameras and on-device SLAM can be used to precisely track the pose of every
joint of each hand. The dataset covers a wide range of diverse manipulation
behaviors with everyday household objects in 194 different tabletop tasks
ranging from tying shoelaces to folding laundry. Furthermore, we train and
systematically evaluate imitation learning policies for hand trajectory
prediction on the dataset, introducing metrics and benchmarks for measuring
progress in this increasingly important area. By releasing this large-scale
dataset, we hope to push the frontier of robotics, computer vision, and
foundation models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有数据驱动的深度生成模型（如扩散模型）需要大量干净训练数据，而无需训练数据的方法（如DIP）存在噪声过拟合和计算成本高的问题。UGoDIT旨在解决这些问题，特别是在低数据情况下。

Method: UGoDIT通过优化共享编码器和M个解耦解码器学习可迁移权重。测试时，部分参数固定为学习到的权重，其余参数优化以保持测量一致性。

Result: 在医学和自然图像恢复任务中，UGoDIT显著提升了重建质量和收敛速度，性能接近SOTA方法，且无需大量干净数据。

Conclusion: UGoDIT在低数据情况下表现出色，为无监督图像重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in data-centric deep generative models have led to
significant progress in solving inverse imaging problems. However, these models
(e.g., diffusion models (DMs)) typically require large amounts of fully sampled
(clean) training data, which is often impractical in medical and scientific
settings such as dynamic imaging.
  On the other hand, training-data-free approaches like the Deep Image Prior
(DIP) do not require clean ground-truth images but suffer from noise
overfitting and can be computationally expensive as the network parameters need
to be optimized for each measurement set independently. Moreover, DIP-based
methods often overlook the potential of learning a prior using a small number
of sub-sampled measurements (or degraded images) available during training. In
this paper, we propose UGoDIT, an Unsupervised Group DIP via Transferable
weights, designed for the low-data regime where only a very small number, M, of
sub-sampled measurement vectors are available during training. Our method
learns a set of transferable weights by optimizing a shared encoder and M
disentangled decoders. At test time, we reconstruct the unseen degraded image
using a DIP network, where part of the parameters are fixed to the learned
weights, while the remaining are optimized to enforce measurement consistency.
We evaluate UGoDIT on both medical (multi-coil MRI) and natural (super
resolution and non-linear deblurring) image recovery tasks under various
settings. Compared to recent standalone DIP methods, UGoDIT provides
accelerated convergence and notable improvement in reconstruction quality.
Furthermore, our method achieves performance competitive with SOTA DM-based and
supervised approaches, despite not requiring large amounts of clean training
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏图形的视觉质量评估因缺乏参考图像和独特失真类型（如锯齿、纹理模糊等）而具有挑战性，现有NR-IQA/VQA方法无法直接适用。

Method: 模型采用知识蒸馏的Game distortion feature extractor（GDFE）检测游戏特有失真，并结合CLIP嵌入的语义门控动态加权特征重要性。

Result: GDFE能有效泛化到未见过的中间失真水平，语义门控提升了上下文相关性并减少预测方差，模型在同类游戏中表现优于跨领域方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为游戏图形质量自动评估奠定了基础，推动了NR-IQA方法在游戏领域的应用。

Abstract: Assessing the visual quality of video game graphics presents unique
challenges due to the absence of reference images and the distinct types of
distortions, such as aliasing, texture blur, and geometry level of detail (LOD)
issues, which differ from those in natural images or user-generated content.
Existing no-reference image and video quality assessment (NR-IQA/VQA) methods
fail to generalize to gaming environments as they are primarily designed for
distortions like compression artifacts. This study introduces a
semantically-aware NR-IQA model tailored to gaming. The model employs a
knowledge-distilled Game distortion feature extractor (GDFE) to detect and
quantify game-specific distortions, while integrating semantic gating via CLIP
embeddings to dynamically weight feature importance based on scene content.
Training on gameplay data recorded across graphical quality presets enables the
model to produce quality scores that align with human perception. Our results
demonstrate that the GDFE, trained through knowledge distillation from binary
classifiers, generalizes effectively to intermediate distortion levels unseen
during training. Semantic gating further improves contextual relevance and
reduces prediction variance. In the absence of in-domain NR-IQA baselines, our
model outperforms out-of-domain methods and exhibits robust, monotonic quality
trends across unseen games in the same genre. This work establishes a
foundation for automated graphical quality assessment in gaming, advancing
NR-IQA methods in this domain.

Conclusion: X-Edit作为一种强大的取证工具，有望用于检测和定位高级图像编辑技术引入的篡改。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have significantly advanced image editing,
enabling highly realistic and local modifications based on textual prompts.
While these developments expand creative possibilities, their malicious use
poses substantial challenges for detection of such subtle deepfake edits. To
this end, we introduce Explain Edit (X-Edit), a novel method for localizing
diffusion-based edits in images. To localize the edits for an image, we invert
the image using a pretrained diffusion model, then use these inverted features
as input to a segmentation network that explicitly predicts the edited masked
regions via channel and spatial attention. Further, we finetune the model using
a combined segmentation and relevance loss. The segmentation loss ensures
accurate mask prediction by balancing pixel-wise errors and perceptual
similarity, while the relevance loss guides the model to focus on low-frequency
regions and mitigate high-frequency artifacts, enhancing the localization of
subtle edits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address and
model the problem of localizing diffusion-based modified regions in images. We
additionally contribute a new dataset of paired original and edited images
addressing the current lack of resources for this task. Experimental results
demonstrate that X-Edit accurately localizes edits in images altered by
text-guided diffusion models, outperforming baselines in PSNR and SSIM metrics.
This highlights X-Edit's potential as a robust forensic tool for detecting and
pinpointing manipulations introduced by advanced image editing techniques.

Abstract: Few-shot adaptation remains a core challenge for vision-language models

propose PromptFuseNL, a unified framework that enhances few-shot generalization
by combining predictive prompt tuning with dual-branch positive and negative
learning. The method refines class prototypes through task-conditioned
residuals, multi-stage cross-modal coordination, and semantic hard negative
mining. To address label noise, we introduce an unsupervised instance
reweighting strategy that downweights unreliable support examples without
requiring additional labels or structural changes. PromptFuseNL fuses visual
and textual cues through lightweight modules for efficient and discriminative
prediction. Evaluated across 15 benchmarks, it consistently surpasses existing
prompt- and adapter-based methods in all shot settings while remaining highly
efficient, achieving up to 300x faster training and 1000x lower FLOPs compared
to full prompt tuning, achieving a new state-of-the-art for robust and scalable

Conclusion: Self-NPO为负偏好优化提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，适用于数据稀缺或难以获取的场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various visual
generation tasks, including image, video, and 3D content generation. Preference
optimization (PO) is a prominent and growing area of research that aims to
align these models with human preferences. While existing PO methods primarily
concentrate on producing favorable outputs, they often overlook the
significance of classifier-free guidance (CFG) in mitigating undesirable
results. Diffusion-NPO addresses this gap by introducing negative preference
optimization (NPO), training models to generate outputs opposite to human
preferences and thereby steering them away from unfavorable outcomes. However,
prior NPO approaches, including Diffusion-NPO, rely on costly and fragile
procedures for obtaining explicit preference annotations (e.g., manual pairwise
labeling or reward model training), limiting their practicality in domains
where such data are scarce or difficult to acquire. In this work, we introduce
Self-NPO, a Negative Preference Optimization approach that learns exclusively
from the model itself, thereby eliminating the need for manual data labeling or
reward model training. Moreover, our method is highly efficient and does not
require exhaustive data sampling. We demonstrate that Self-NPO integrates
seamlessly into widely used diffusion models, including SD1.5, SDXL, and
CogVideoX, as well as models already optimized for human preferences,
consistently enhancing both their generation quality and alignment with human
preferences.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) has attracted remarkable attention in hyperspectral
image (HSI) processing fields, and most existing deep learning (DL)-based
algorithms indicate dramatic potential for detecting anomaly samples through
specific training process under current scenario. However, the limited prior
information and the catastrophic forgetting problem indicate crucial challenges
for existing DL structure in open scenarios cross-domain detection. In order to
improve the detection performance, a novel continual learning-based capsule
differential generative adversarial network (CL-CaGAN) is proposed to elevate
the cross-scenario learning performance for facilitating the real application
of DL-based structure in hyperspectral AD (HAD) task. First, a modified capsule
structure with adversarial learning network is constructed to estimate the
background distribution for surmounting the deficiency of prior information. To
mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, clustering-based sample replay
strategy and a designed extra self-distillation regularization are integrated
for merging the history and future knowledge in continual AD task, while the
discriminative learning ability from previous detection scenario to current
scenario is retained by the elaborately designed structure with continual
learning (CL) strategy. In addition, the differentiable enhancement is enforced
to augment the generation performance of the training data. This further
stabilizes the training process with better convergence and efficiently
consolidates the reconstruction ability of background samples. To verify the
effectiveness of our proposed CL-CaGAN, we conduct experiments on several real
HSIs, and the results indicate that the proposed CL-CaGAN demonstrates higher
detection performance and continuous learning capacity for mitigating the
catastrophic forgetting under cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Memory stability and learning flexibility in continual learning (CL) is a
core challenge for cross-scene Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection (HAD) task.
Biological neural networks can actively forget history knowledge that conflicts
with the learning of new experiences by regulating learning-triggered synaptic
expansion and synaptic convergence. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a
novel Biologically-Inspired Continual Learning Generative Adversarial Network
(CL-BioGAN) for augmenting continuous distribution fitting ability for
cross-domain HAD task, where Continual Learning Bio-inspired Loss (CL-Bio Loss)
and self-attention Generative Adversarial Network (BioGAN) are incorporated to
realize forgetting history knowledge as well as involving replay strategy in
the proposed BioGAN. Specifically, a novel Bio-Inspired Loss composed with an
Active Forgetting Loss (AF Loss) and a CL loss is designed to realize
parameters releasing and enhancing between new task and history tasks from a
Bayesian perspective. Meanwhile, BioGAN loss with L2-Norm enhances
self-attention (SA) to further balance the stability and flexibility for better
fitting background distribution for open scenario HAD (OHAD) tasks. Experiment
results underscore that the proposed CL-BioGAN can achieve more robust and
satisfying accuracy for cross-domain HAD with fewer parameters and computation
cost. This dual contribution not only elevates CL performance but also offers
new insights into neural adaptation mechanisms in OHAD task.

Conclusion: ARGS-Diff为高光谱和多光谱图像融合提供了一种高效且无需额外训练数据的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral and multispectral image (HSI-MSI) fusion involves combining a
low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) with a high-resolution
multispectral image (HR-MSI) to generate a high-resolution hyperspectral image
(HR-HSI). Most deep learning-based methods for HSI-MSI fusion rely on large
amounts of hyperspectral data for supervised training, which is often scarce in
practical applications. In this paper, we propose a self-learning Adaptive
Residual Guided Subspace Diffusion Model (ARGS-Diff), which only utilizes the
observed images without any extra training data. Specifically, as the LR-HSI
contains spectral information and the HR-MSI contains spatial information, we
design two lightweight spectral and spatial diffusion models to separately
learn the spectral and spatial distributions from them. Then, we use these two
models to reconstruct HR-HSI from two low-dimensional components, i.e, the
spectral basis and the reduced coefficient, during the reverse diffusion
process. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Residual Guided Module (ARGM),
which refines the two components through a residual guided function at each
sampling step, thereby stabilizing the sampling process. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that ARGS-Diff outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods in terms of both performance and computational efficiency in the field
of HSI-MSI fusion. Code is available at https://github.com/Zhu1116/ARGS-Diff.

TLDR: 研究发现，尽管大规模视觉语言模型（VLMs）在不确定性任务中表现更稳健，但仍存在对模糊输入过度自信的问题。通过简单提示模型避免不确定预测，可显著提升可靠性，但在特定领域任务中仍存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大规模视觉语言模型在面对不确定和模糊输入时的鲁棒性，揭示其局限性并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过异常检测和模糊分类任务测试VLMs的表现，并提出基于标题多样性的新机制来揭示模型内部不确定性。

Result: 新VLMs表现更稳健，但仍有过度自信问题；简单提示可提升可靠性，但特定领域任务仍需改进。

Conclusion: 模型需进一步优化以处理模糊输入，提出的新机制为无标签数据下的不确定性预测提供了可能。

Abstract: Robustness against uncertain and ambiguous inputs is a critical challenge for
deep learning models. While recent advancements in large scale vision language
models (VLMs, e.g. GPT4o) might suggest that increasing model and training
dataset size would mitigate this issue, our empirical evaluation shows a more
complicated picture. Testing models using two classic uncertainty
quantification tasks, anomaly detection and classification under inherently
ambiguous conditions, we find that newer and larger VLMs indeed exhibit
improved robustness compared to earlier models, but still suffer from a
tendency to strictly follow instructions, often causing them to hallucinate
confident responses even when faced with unclear or anomalous inputs.
Remarkably, for natural images such as ImageNet, this limitation can be
overcome without pipeline modifications: simply prompting models to abstain
from uncertain predictions enables significant reliability gains, achieving
near-perfect robustness in several settings. However, for domain-specific tasks
such as galaxy morphology classification, a lack of specialized knowledge
prevents reliable uncertainty estimation. Finally, we propose a novel mechanism
based on caption diversity to reveal a model's internal uncertainty, enabling
practitioners to predict when models will successfully abstain without relying
on labeled data.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于图像的新型可见性分析方法，利用视觉语言模型（VLM）检测街景图像中的目标对象，并通过异构图分析观察者与目标对象的复杂交互，弥补了传统基于视线（LoS）方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于几何交点的可见性分析方法无法捕捉城市地标等对象的上下文和感知维度，因此需要一种更贴近真实体验的方法。

Method: 应用VLM检测街景图像中的目标对象，构建异构图分析观察者与目标的交互关系。

Result: 方法在检测全球城市六个地标的可见性时准确率达87%，并揭示了伦敦泰晤士河沿岸地标的连接形式和强度。

Conclusion: 该方法补充并增强了传统LoS分析，为城市规划、遗产保护和社会计算提供了新视角。

Abstract: Visibility analysis is one of the fundamental analytics methods in urban
planning and landscape research, traditionally conducted through computational
simulations based on the Line-of-Sight (LoS) principle. However, when assessing
the visibility of named urban objects such as landmarks, geometric intersection
alone fails to capture the contextual and perceptual dimensions of visibility
as experienced in the real world. The study challenges the traditional
LoS-based approaches by introducing a new, image-based visibility analysis
method. Specifically, a Vision Language Model (VLM) is applied to detect the
target object within a direction-zoomed Street View Image (SVI). Successful
detection represents the object's visibility at the corresponding SVI location.
Further, a heterogeneous visibility graph is constructed to address the complex
interaction between observers and target objects. In the first case study, the
method proves its reliability in detecting the visibility of six tall landmark
constructions in global cities, with an overall accuracy of 87%. Furthermore,
it reveals broader contextual differences when the landmarks are perceived and
experienced. In the second case, the proposed visibility graph uncovers the
form and strength of connections for multiple landmarks along the River Thames
in London, as well as the places where these connections occur. Notably,
bridges on the River Thames account for approximately 30% of total connections.
Our method complements and enhances traditional LoS-based visibility analysis,
and showcases the possibility of revealing the prevalent connection of any
visual objects in the urban environment. It opens up new research perspectives
for urban planning, heritage conservation, and computational social science.

Abstract: Data augmentation for domain-specific image classification tasks often
struggles to simultaneously address diversity, faithfulness, and label clarity
of generated data, leading to suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. While
existing generative diffusion model-based methods aim to enhance augmentation,
they fail to cohesively tackle these three critical aspects and often overlook
intrinsic challenges of diffusion models, such as sensitivity to model
characteristics and stochasticity under strong transformations. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework that explicitly integrates diversity,
faithfulness, and label clarity into the augmentation process. Our approach
employs saliency-guided mixing and a fine-tuned diffusion model to preserve
foreground semantics, enrich background diversity, and ensure label
consistency, while mitigating diffusion model limitations. Extensive
experiments across fine-grained, long-tail, few-shot, and background robustness
tasks demonstrate our method's superior performance over state-of-the-art
approaches.

Conclusion: UniMoCo通过模态补全范式解决了传统方法因训练数据模态不平衡导致的固有偏差。

Abstract: Current research has explored vision-language models for multi-modal
embedding tasks, such as information retrieval, visual grounding, and
classification. However, real-world scenarios often involve diverse modality
combinations between queries and targets, such as text and image to text, text
and image to text and image, and text to text and image. These diverse
combinations pose significant challenges for existing models, as they struggle
to align all modality combinations within a unified embedding space during
training, which degrades performance at inference. To address this limitation,
we propose UniMoCo, a novel vision-language model architecture designed for
multi-modal embedding tasks. UniMoCo introduces a modality-completion module
that generates visual features from textual inputs, ensuring modality
completeness for both queries and targets. Additionally, we develop a
specialized training strategy to align embeddings from both original and
modality-completed inputs, ensuring consistency within the embedding space.
This enables the model to robustly handle a wide range of modality combinations
across embedding tasks. Experiments show that UniMoCo outperforms previous
methods while demonstrating consistent robustness across diverse settings. More
importantly, we identify and quantify the inherent bias in conventional
approaches caused by imbalance of modality combinations in training data, which
can be mitigated through our modality-completion paradigm. The code is

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在长任务序列场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: CoSO通过动态子空间优化有效提升了持续学习的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to learn multiple tasks sequentially while preserving
prior knowledge, but faces the challenge of catastrophic forgetting when
acquiring new knowledge. Recently, approaches leveraging pre-trained models
have gained increasing popularity to mitigate this issue, due to the strong
generalization ability of foundation models. To adjust pre-trained models for
new tasks, existing methods usually employ low-rank adaptation, which restricts
parameter updates to a fixed low-rank subspace. However, constraining the
optimization space inherently compromises the model's learning capacity,
resulting in inferior performance. To address the limitation, we propose
Continuous Subspace Optimization for Continual Learning (CoSO) to fine-tune the
model in a series of subspaces rather than a single one. These sequential
subspaces are dynamically determined through the singular value decomposition
of gradients. CoSO updates the model by projecting gradients into these
subspaces, ensuring memory-efficient optimization. To mitigate forgetting, the
optimization subspaces of each task are set to be orthogonal to the historical
task subspace. During task learning, CoSO maintains a task-specific component
that captures the critical update directions associated with the current task.
Upon completing a task, this component is used to update the historical task
subspace, laying the groundwork for subsequent learning. Extensive experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate that CoSO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with long task
sequences.

Motivation: 跨视角地理定位（CVGL）因视角变化导致的外观和空间变形问题极具挑战性，现有方法假设特征空间可直接对齐，但忽略了视角差异引起的冲突。

Method: 提出CVD框架，将特征空间建模为内容和视角共同作用的复合流形，引入两种约束：1）视图内独立性约束，最小化互信息；2）视图间重建约束，通过交叉组合保留语义。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（University-1652、SUES-200、CVUSA和CVACT）上，CVD显著提升了定位准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CVD通过解耦内容和视角因素，有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的特征不一致问题，并可无缝集成到现有流程中。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same
geographic location captured from different perspectives, such as drones and
satellites. Despite recent advances, CVGL remains highly challenging due to
significant appearance changes and spatial distortions caused by viewpoint
variations. Existing methods typically assume that cross-view images can be
directly aligned within a shared feature space by maximizing feature similarity
through contrastive learning. Nonetheless, this assumption overlooks the
inherent conflicts induced by viewpoint discrepancies, resulting in extracted
features containing inconsistent information that hinders precise localization.
In this study, we take a manifold learning perspective and model the feature
space of cross-view images as a composite manifold jointly governed by content
and viewpoint information. Building upon this insight, we propose
$\textbf{CVD}$, a new CVGL framework that explicitly disentangles
$\textit{content}$ and $\textit{viewpoint}$ factors. To promote effective
disentanglement, we introduce two constraints: $\textit{(i)}$ An intra-view
independence constraint, which encourages statistical independence between the
two factors by minimizing their mutual information. $\textit{(ii)}$ An
inter-view reconstruction constraint that reconstructs each view by
cross-combining $\textit{content}$ and $\textit{viewpoint}$ from paired images,
ensuring factor-specific semantics are preserved. As a plug-and-play module,
CVD can be seamlessly integrated into existing geo-localization pipelines.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks, i.e., University-1652, SUES-200,
CVUSA, and CVACT, demonstrate that CVD consistently improves both localization
accuracy and generalization across multiple baselines.

Motivation: 获取大规模高质量数据困难，而部分数据（如低分辨率图像、带水印视频）易得，研究如何利用这些数据训练扩散模型。

Method: 提出多视图训练方法：先为每个部分数据视图训练单独的扩散模型，再训练残差评分函数预测模型。

Result: 理论证明该方法在适当正则化下能降低泛化误差，且残差评分函数训练难度与部分数据未捕获的信号相关性成正比。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了接近一阶最优的数据效率，为利用部分数据训练扩散模型提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Training diffusion models requires large datasets. However, acquiring large
volumes of high-quality data can be challenging, for example, collecting large
numbers of high-resolution images and long videos. On the other hand, there are
many complementary data that are usually considered corrupted or partial, such
as low-resolution images and short videos. Other examples of corrupted data
include videos that contain subtitles, watermarks, and logos. In this study, we
investigate the theoretical problem of whether the above partial data can be
utilized to train conventional diffusion models. Motivated by our theoretical
analysis in this study, we propose a straightforward approach of training
diffusion models utilizing partial data views, where we consider each form of
complementary data as a view of conventional data. Our proposed approach first
trains one separate diffusion model for each individual view, and then trains a
model for predicting the residual score function. We prove generalization error
bounds, which show that the proposed diffusion model training approach can
achieve lower generalization errors if proper regularizations are adopted in
the residual score function training. In particular, we prove that the
difficulty in training the residual score function scales proportionally with
the signal correlations not captured by partial data views. Consequently, the
proposed approach achieves near first-order optimal data efficiency.

Abstract: System2 reasoning is developing rapidly these days with the emergence of
Deep- Thinking Models and chain-of-thought technology, which has become a
centralized discussion point in the AI community. However, there is a relative
gap in the research on complex video reasoning at present. In this work, we
propose CoT-Vid, a novel training-free paradigm for the video domain with a
multistage complex reasoning design. Distinguishing from existing video LLMs,
which rely heavily on perceptual abilities, it achieved surprising performance
gain with explicit reasoning mechanism. The paradigm consists of three main
components: dynamic inference path routing, problem decoupling strategy, and
video self-consistency verification. In addition, we propose a new standard for
categorization of video questions. CoT- Vid showed outstanding results on a
wide range of benchmarks, and outperforms its base model by 9.3% on Egochema
and 5.6% on VideoEspresso, rivalling or even surpassing larger and proprietary

Conclusion: 提出的方法解决了现有基准的局限性，RVTagent框架展示了零样本泛化的潜力。

Abstract: Visual reasoning, the capability to interpret visual input in response to
implicit text query through multi-step reasoning, remains a challenge for deep
learning models due to the lack of relevant benchmarks. Previous work in visual
reasoning has primarily focused on reasoning segmentation, where models aim to
segment objects based on implicit text queries. This paper introduces reasoning
visual tasks (RVTs), a unified formulation that extends beyond traditional
video reasoning segmentation to a diverse family of visual language reasoning
problems, which can therefore accommodate multiple output formats including
bounding boxes, natural language descriptions, and question-answer pairs.
Correspondingly, we identify the limitations in current benchmark construction
methods that rely solely on large language models (LLMs), which inadequately
capture complex spatial-temporal relationships and multi-step reasoning chains
in video due to their reliance on token representation, resulting in benchmarks
with artificially limited reasoning complexity. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel automated RVT benchmark construction pipeline that leverages
digital twin (DT) representations as structured intermediaries between
perception and the generation of implicit text queries. Based on this method,
we construct RVTBench, a RVT benchmark containing 3,896 queries of over 1.2
million tokens across four types of RVT (segmentation, grounding, VQA and
summary), three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal), and
four increasing difficulty levels, derived from 200 video sequences. Finally,
we propose RVTagent, an agent framework for RVT that allows for zero-shot
generalization across various types of RVT without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) raises
safety concerns under potential malicious inputs. However, existing multimodal
safety evaluations primarily focus on model vulnerabilities exposed by static
image inputs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of video that may induce distinct
safety risks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under
video-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48
fine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a
harmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears
harmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To
generate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a
controllable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what
is shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of
query-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful
outputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the
confidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration.
Extensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average
attack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to
video-induced attacks. We believe Video-SafetyBench will catalyze future
research into video-based safety evaluation and defense strategies.

logic, identifying a fall when a designated prone pose ("Pose6") is held for
over 3 seconds coupled with a significant drop in motion detected for more than

Conclusion: MedSG-Bench填补了医学图像序列定位的空白，为多模态大语言模型在医学领域的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Visual grounding is essential for precise perception and reasoning in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially in medical imaging
domains. While existing medical visual grounding benchmarks primarily focus on
single-image scenarios, real-world clinical applications often involve
sequential images, where accurate lesion localization across different
modalities and temporal tracking of disease progression (e.g., pre- vs.
post-treatment comparison) require fine-grained cross-image semantic alignment
and context-aware reasoning. To remedy the underrepresentation of image
sequences in existing medical visual grounding benchmarks, we propose
MedSG-Bench, the first benchmark tailored for Medical Image Sequences
Grounding. It comprises eight VQA-style tasks, formulated into two paradigms of
the grounding tasks, including 1) Image Difference Grounding, which focuses on
detecting change regions across images, and 2) Image Consistency Grounding,
which emphasizes detection of consistent or shared semantics across sequential
images. MedSG-Bench covers 76 public datasets, 10 medical imaging modalities,
and a wide spectrum of anatomical structures and diseases, totaling 9,630
question-answer pairs. We benchmark both general-purpose MLLMs (e.g.,

Conclusion: 该框架在零样本条件下表现出色，为具身智能等领域的动态环境分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurately analyzing the motion parts and their motion attributes in dynamic
environments is crucial for advancing key areas such as embodied intelligence.
Addressing the limitations of existing methods that rely on dense multi-view
images or detailed part-level annotations, we propose an innovative framework
that can analyze 3D mobility from monocular videos in a zero-shot manner. This
framework can precisely parse motion parts and motion attributes only using a
monocular video, completely eliminating the need for annotated training data.
Specifically, our method first constructs the scene geometry and roughly
analyzes the motion parts and their initial motion attributes combining depth
estimation, optical flow analysis and point cloud registration method, then
employs 2D Gaussian splatting for scene representation. Building on this, we
introduce an end-to-end dynamic scene optimization algorithm specifically
designed for articulated objects, refining the initial analysis results to
ensure the system can handle 'rotation', 'translation', and even complex
movements ('rotation+translation'), demonstrating high flexibility and
versatility. To validate the robustness and wide applicability of our method,
we created a comprehensive dataset comprising both simulated and real-world
scenarios. Experimental results show that our framework can effectively analyze
articulated object motions in an annotation-free manner, showcasing its
significant potential in future embodied intelligence applications.

Result: PRS-Med在六种成像模态中表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PRS-Med通过自然语言交互提升诊断效率，相关资源将开源以推动研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in prompt-based medical image segmentation have enabled
clinicians to identify tumors using simple input like bounding boxes or text
prompts. However, existing methods face challenges when doctors need to
interact through natural language or when position reasoning is required -
understanding spatial relationships between anatomical structures and
pathologies. We present PRS-Med, a framework that integrates vision-language
models with segmentation capabilities to generate both accurate segmentation
masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. Additionally, we introduce
the MMRS dataset (Multimodal Medical in Positional Reasoning Segmentation),
which provides diverse, spatially-grounded question-answer pairs to address the
lack of position reasoning data in medical imaging. PRS-Med demonstrates
superior performance across six imaging modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, ultrasound,
endoscopy, RGB), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both
segmentation accuracy and position reasoning. Our approach enables intuitive
doctor-system interaction through natural language, facilitating more efficient
diagnoses. Our dataset pipeline, model, and codebase will be released to foster
further research in spatially-aware multimodal reasoning for medical
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出正交残差更新方法，通过分解模块输出并仅添加与输入流正交的分量，以增强特征学习和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准残差更新可能导致模块输出主要强化或调制现有流方向，未能充分利用模块学习全新特征的能力。

Method: 引入正交残差更新，分解模块输出并仅添加与输入流正交的分量。

Result: 在多种架构和数据集上提升泛化精度和训练稳定性，如ViT-B在ImageNet-1k上提升4.3%的top-1准确率。

Conclusion: 正交残差更新策略能有效促进新特征学习，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Residual connections are pivotal for deep neural networks, enabling greater
depth by mitigating vanishing gradients. However, in standard residual updates,
the module's output is directly added to the input stream. This can lead to
updates that predominantly reinforce or modulate the existing stream direction,
potentially underutilizing the module's capacity for learning entirely novel
features. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal Residual Update: we decompose
the module's output relative to the input stream and add only the component
orthogonal to this stream. This design aims to guide modules to contribute
primarily new representational directions, fostering richer feature learning
while promoting more efficient training. We demonstrate that our orthogonal
update strategy improves generalization accuracy and training stability across
diverse architectures (ResNetV2, Vision Transformers) and datasets (CIFARs,
TinyImageNet, ImageNet-1k), achieving, for instance, a +4.3\%p top-1 accuracy
gain for ViT-B on ImageNet-1k.

Motivation: 现有生成式零样本学习方法仅依赖专家标注的强类别语义向量生成视觉特征，导致生成性能不佳且场景泛化有限。

Method: GenZSL采用归纳变分自编码器，从相似已见类别中生成新类别样本，并结合类别多样性促进和目标类别引导信息增强策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，GenZSL显著优于f-VAEGAN，性能提升24.7%，训练速度加快60倍以上。

Conclusion: GenZSL通过弱语义向量和优化策略，有效提升了生成式零样本学习的性能与效率。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in zero-shot learning (ZSL) has been achieved using
generative models. However, existing generative ZSL methods merely generate
(imagine) the visual features from scratch guided by the strong class semantic
vectors annotated by experts, resulting in suboptimal generative performance
and limited scene generalization. To address these and advance ZSL, we propose
an inductive variational autoencoder for generative zero-shot learning, dubbed
GenZSL. Mimicking human-level concept learning, GenZSL operates by inducting
new class samples from similar seen classes using weak class semantic vectors
derived from target class names (i.e., CLIP text embedding). To ensure the
generation of informative samples for training an effective ZSL classifier, our
GenZSL incorporates two key strategies. Firstly, it employs class diversity
promotion to enhance the diversity of class semantic vectors. Secondly, it
utilizes target class-guided information boosting criteria to optimize the
model. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark datasets
showcase the superiority and potential of our GenZSL with significant efficacy
and efficiency over f-VAEGAN, e.g., 24.7% performance gains and more than
$60\times$ faster training speed on AWA2. Codes are available at

Abstract: Face recognition performance based on deep learning heavily relies on
large-scale training data, which is often difficult to acquire in practical

ResNet-V1 based FaceNet discriminator for improved adversarial training, and
(3) an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes data generation and

Method: 提出了一种对抗性校准框架，通过引入模态特定的投影头（仅使用对抗样本训练），保持主干和嵌入层冻结，并探索了三种训练目标和正则化策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在六种模态和三种Bind风格模型上，对抗性鲁棒性提升了47.3%，同时保持了干净的零样本和检索性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了多模态编码器的对抗性鲁棒性，且无需修改预训练编码器或语义中心，兼容现有基础模型。

Abstract: Recent unified multi-modal encoders align a wide range of modalities into a
shared representation space, enabling diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite their
impressive capabilities, the robustness of these models under adversarial
perturbations remains underexplored, which is a critical concern for
safety-sensitive applications. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
study of adversarial vulnerability in unified multi-modal encoders. We find
that even mild adversarial perturbations lead to substantial performance drops
across all modalities. Non-visual inputs, such as audio and point clouds, are
especially fragile, while visual inputs like images and videos also degrade
significantly. To address this, we propose an efficient adversarial calibration
framework that improves robustness across modalities without modifying
pretrained encoders or semantic centers, ensuring compatibility with existing
foundation models. Our method introduces modality-specific projection heads
trained solely on adversarial examples, while keeping the backbone and
embeddings frozen. We explore three training objectives: fixed-center
cross-entropy, clean-to-adversarial L2 alignment, and clean-adversarial
InfoNCE, and we introduce a regularization strategy to ensure
modality-consistent alignment under attack. Experiments on six modalities and
three Bind-style models show that our method improves adversarial robustness by
up to 47.3 percent at epsilon = 4/255, while preserving or even improving clean
zero-shot and retrieval performance with less than 1 percent trainable
parameters.

TLDR: FiGKD是一种基于频率感知的知识蒸馏框架，通过小波变换分解教师模型的输出，选择性传递高频细节信息，提升细粒度视觉任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法在细粒度视觉任务中表现不佳，因传统方法将教师模型的输出视为单一信号，忽略了细节信息的重要性。

Method: 提出FiGKD框架，利用离散小波变换分解教师模型的输出，仅传递高频细节信息，避免冗余信号干扰。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、TinyImageNet等数据集上，FiGKD优于现有基于输出和特征的知识蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 频率感知的logit分解能更高效地传递知识，尤其在资源受限的场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted technique for transferring
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to a smaller student model by
aligning their output distributions. However, existing methods often
underperform in fine-grained visual recognition tasks, where distinguishing
subtle differences between visually similar classes is essential. This
performance gap stems from the fact that conventional approaches treat the
teacher's output logits as a single, undifferentiated signal-assuming all
contained information is equally beneficial to the student. Consequently,
student models may become overloaded with redundant signals and fail to capture
the teacher's nuanced decision boundaries. To address this issue, we propose
Fine-Grained Knowledge Distillation (FiGKD), a novel frequency-aware framework
that decomposes a model's logits into low-frequency (content) and
high-frequency (detail) components using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT).
FiGKD selectively transfers only the high-frequency components, which encode
the teacher's semantic decision patterns, while discarding redundant
low-frequency content already conveyed through ground-truth supervision. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and requires no access to
intermediate feature maps. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet,
and multiple fine-grained recognition benchmarks show that FiGKD consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art logit-based and feature-based distillation methods
across a variety of teacher-student configurations. These findings confirm that
frequency-aware logit decomposition enables more efficient and effective
knowledge transfer, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

Additionally, we present a benchmark covering these challenging object classes,
providing high-quality annotations for evaluating both tracking and

recovering high-fidelity object meshes, setting a new standard for
single-sensor 3D reconstruction in open-world environments.

Result: 评估8种MLLMs（包括GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro），发现模型在全景空间推理中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在全景空间推理中仍有不足，需进一步改进感知能力。

Abstract: The 180x360 omnidirectional field of view captured by 360-degree cameras
enables their use in a wide range of applications such as embodied AI and
virtual reality. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have shown promise in visual-spatial reasoning, most studies focus on
standard pinhole-view images, leaving omnidirectional perception largely
unexplored. In this paper, we ask: Are MLLMs ready for omnidirectional spatial
reasoning? To investigate this, we introduce OSR-Bench, the first benchmark
specifically designed for this setting. OSR-Bench includes over 153,000 diverse
question-answer pairs grounded in high-fidelity panoramic indoor scene maps. It
covers key reasoning types including object counting, relative distance, and
direction. We also propose a negative sampling strategy that inserts
non-existent objects into prompts to evaluate hallucination and grounding
robustness. For fine-grained analysis, we design a two-stage evaluation
framework assessing both cognitive map generation and QA accuracy using
rotation-invariant matching and a combination of rule-based and LLM-based
metrics. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5
Pro, and leading open-source models under zero-shot settings. Results show that
current models struggle with spatial reasoning in panoramic contexts,
highlighting the need for more perceptually grounded MLLMs. OSR-Bench and code

Conclusion: DC-Seg通过解耦和对比学习，显著提升了多模态脑图像分割的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain images typically requires the integration of
complementary information from multiple image modalities. However, clinical
data for all modalities may not be available for every patient, creating a
significant challenge. To address this, previous studies encode multiple
modalities into a shared latent space. While somewhat effective, it remains
suboptimal, as each modality contains distinct and valuable information. In
this study, we propose DC-Seg (Disentangled Contrastive Learning for
Segmentation), a new method that explicitly disentangles images into
modality-invariant anatomical representation and modality-specific
representation, by using anatomical contrastive learning and modality
contrastive learning respectively. This solution improves the separation of
anatomical and modality-specific features by considering the modality gaps,
leading to more robust representations. Furthermore, we introduce a
segmentation-based regularizer that enhances the model's robustness to missing
modalities. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2020 and a private white matter
hyperintensity(WMH) segmentation dataset demonstrate that DC-Seg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in handling incomplete multimodal brain tumor
segmentation tasks with varying missing modalities, while also demonstrate
strong generalizability in WMH segmentation. The code is available at

Result: SafeVid显著提升VLMMs安全性（如LLaVA-NeXT-Video提升42.39%）。

Conclusion: SafeVid通过文本描述桥接安全推理，为VLMMs提供了有效的安全对齐方法。

Abstract: As Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) rapidly advance, their inherent
complexity introduces significant safety challenges, particularly the issue of
mismatched generalization where static safety alignments fail to transfer to
dynamic video contexts. We introduce SafeVid, a framework designed to instill
video-specific safety principles in VLMMs. SafeVid uniquely transfers robust
textual safety alignment capabilities to the video domain by employing detailed
textual video descriptions as an interpretive bridge, facilitating LLM-based
rule-driven safety reasoning. This is achieved through a closed-loop system
comprising: 1) generation of SafeVid-350K, a novel 350,000-pair video-specific
safety preference dataset; 2) targeted alignment of VLMMs using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO); and 3) comprehensive evaluation via our new
SafeVidBench benchmark. Alignment with SafeVid-350K significantly enhances VLMM
safety, with models like LLaVA-NeXT-Video demonstrating substantial
improvements (e.g., up to 42.39%) on SafeVidBench. SafeVid provides critical
resources and a structured approach, demonstrating that leveraging textual
descriptions as a conduit for safety reasoning markedly improves the safety
alignment of VLMMs. We have made SafeVid-350K dataset

Conclusion: iSegMan通过创新的交互技术和高效分割方法，解决了现有3D场景操纵的局限性，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The efficient rendering and explicit nature of 3DGS promote the advancement
of 3D scene manipulation. However, existing methods typically encounter
challenges in controlling the manipulation region and are unable to furnish the
user with interactive feedback, which inevitably leads to unexpected results.
Intuitively, incorporating interactive 3D segmentation tools can compensate for
this deficiency. Nevertheless, existing segmentation frameworks impose a
pre-processing step of scene-specific parameter training, which limits the
efficiency and flexibility of scene manipulation. To deliver a 3D region
control module that is well-suited for scene manipulation with reliable
efficiency, we propose interactive Segment-and-Manipulate 3D Gaussians
(iSegMan), an interactive segmentation and manipulation framework that only
requires simple 2D user interactions in any view. To propagate user
interactions to other views, we propose Epipolar-guided Interaction Propagation
(EIP), which innovatively exploits epipolar constraint for efficient and robust
interaction matching. To avoid scene-specific training to maintain efficiency,
we further propose the novel Visibility-based Gaussian Voting (VGV), which
obtains 2D segmentations from SAM and models the region extraction as a voting
game between 2D Pixels and 3D Gaussians based on Gaussian visibility. Taking
advantage of the efficient and precise region control of EIP and VGV, we put
forth a Manipulation Toolbox to implement various functions on selected
regions, enhancing the controllability, flexibility and practicality of scene
manipulation. Extensive results on 3D scene manipulation and segmentation tasks
fully demonstrate the significant advantages of iSegMan. Project page is

Conclusion: LLaVA-Meteor在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率，为视觉指令调优提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual instruction tuning aims to enable large language models to comprehend
the visual world, with a pivotal challenge lying in establishing an effective
vision-to-language projection. However, existing methods often grapple with the
intractable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we
present LLaVA-Meteor, a novel approach designed to break this deadlock,
equipped with a novel Top-Down Compression paradigm that strategically
compresses visual tokens without compromising core information. Specifically,
we construct a trainable Flash Global Fusion module based on efficient
selective state space operators, which aligns the feature space while enabling
each token to perceive holistic visual context and instruction preference at
low cost. Furthermore, a local-to-single scanning manner is employed to
effectively capture local dependencies, thereby enhancing the model's
capability in vision modeling. To alleviate computational overhead, we explore
a Visual-Native Selection mechanism that independently assesses token
significance by both the visual and native experts, followed by aggregation to
retain the most critical subset. Extensive experiments show that our approach
reduces visual tokens by 75--95% while achieving comparable or superior
performance across 12 benchmarks, significantly improving efficiency.

Conclusion: 数字化P&ID方法显著提升效率和准确性，为工业应用提供了更可靠的数据基础。

Abstract: Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) constitute the foundational
blueprint of a plant, depicting the interconnections among process equipment,
instrumentation for process control, and the flow of fluids and control
signals. In their existing setup, the manual mapping of information from P&ID
sheets holds a significant challenge. This is a time-consuming process, taking
around 3-6 months, and is susceptible to errors. It also depends on the
expertise of the domain experts and often requires multiple rounds of review.
The digitization of P&IDs entails merging detected line segments, which is
essential for linking various detected instruments, thereby creating a
comprehensive digitized P&ID. This paper focuses on explaining how line
segments which are detected using a computer vision model are merged and
eventually building the connection between equipment and merged lines. Hence
presenting a digitized form of information stating the interconnection between
process equipment, instrumentation, flow of fluids and control signals.
Eventually, which can be stored in a knowledge graph and that information along
with the help of advanced algorithms can be leveraged for tasks like finding
optimal routes, detecting system cycles, computing transitive closures, and
more.

Conclusion: AoP-SAM使SAM更适合自动化分割任务，提升了效率和实用性。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a powerful foundation model for image
segmentation, showing robust zero-shot generalization through prompt
engineering. However, relying on manual prompts is impractical for real-world
applications, particularly in scenarios where rapid prompt provision and
resource efficiency are crucial. In this paper, we propose the Automation of
Prompts for SAM (AoP-SAM), a novel approach that learns to generate essential
prompts in optimal locations automatically. AoP-SAM enhances SAM's efficiency
and usability by eliminating manual input, making it better suited for
real-world tasks. Our approach employs a lightweight yet efficient Prompt
Predictor model that detects key entities across images and identifies the
optimal regions for placing prompt candidates. This method leverages SAM's
image embeddings, preserving its zero-shot generalization capabilities without
requiring fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduce a test-time instance-level
Adaptive Sampling and Filtering mechanism that generates prompts in a
coarse-to-fine manner. This notably enhances both prompt and mask generation
efficiency by reducing computational overhead and minimizing redundant mask
refinements. Evaluations of three datasets demonstrate that AoP-SAM
substantially improves both prompt generation efficiency and mask generation
accuracy, making SAM more effective for automated segmentation tasks.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种新颖的在线迭代自对齐（OISA）方法，用于放射学报告生成（RRG），通过自生成多样化数据、自评估多目标偏好数据、自对齐多目标优化和自迭代进一步改进，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RRG模型依赖有限的高质量标注数据，容易过拟合且泛化能力不足。本文旨在通过自对齐方法解决这些问题。

Method: 提出OISA方法，包括四个阶段：自生成多样化数据、自评估多目标偏好数据、自对齐多目标优化和自迭代改进。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个评估指标上超越了现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: OISA方法通过迭代多目标优化显著提升了RRG模型的数据质量和性能。

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is an important research topic for
relieving radiologist' heavy workload. Existing RRG models mainly rely on
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) based on different model architectures using data
pairs of radiological images and corresponding radiologist-annotated reports.
Recent research has shifted focus to post-training improvements, aligning RRG
model outputs with human preferences using reinforcement learning (RL).
However, the limited data coverage of high-quality annotated data poses risks
of overfitting and generalization. This paper proposes a novel Online Iterative
Self-Alignment (OISA) method for RRG that consists of four stages:
self-generation of diverse data, self-evaluation for multi-objective preference
data,self-alignment for multi-objective optimization and self-iteration for
further improvement. Our approach allows for generating varied reports tailored
to specific clinical objectives, enhancing the overall performance of the RRG
model iteratively. Unlike existing methods, our frame-work significantly
increases data quality and optimizes performance through iterative
multi-objective optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
surpasses previous approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance across
multiple evaluation metrics.

Method: 结合视频扩散模型、可训练相机编码器、极线注意力机制和统一尺度估计策略，生成多视角观测并保持3D一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了稀疏视图重建效果，恢复了3D场景的真实外观。

Conclusion: SpatialCrafter通过几何约束和语义特征整合，有效解决了稀疏输入下的3D重建问题。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) boosts immersive experiences in computer vision
and graphics. Existing techniques, though progressed, rely on dense multi-view
observations, restricting their application. This work takes on the challenge
of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from sparse or single-view inputs.
We introduce SpatialCrafter, a framework that leverages the rich knowledge in
video diffusion models to generate plausible additional observations, thereby
alleviating reconstruction ambiguity. Through a trainable camera encoder and an
epipolar attention mechanism for explicit geometric constraints, we achieve
precise camera control and 3D consistency, further reinforced by a unified
scale estimation strategy to handle scale discrepancies across datasets.
Furthermore, by integrating monocular depth priors with semantic features in
the video latent space, our framework directly regresses 3D Gaussian primitives
and efficiently processes long-sequence features using a hybrid network
structure. Extensive experiments show our method enhances sparse view
reconstruction and restores the realistic appearance of 3D scenes.

Motivation: 现有研究多采用多实例学习聚合病理图像特征，但忽略了上下文和层次细节的信息丢失，且病理与基因组数据在粒度和维度上的差异导致模态不平衡。

Method: 提出超图学习捕获病理图像的上下文和层次细节，并采用模态再平衡机制和交互对齐融合策略动态调整两模态的贡献。

Result: 在五个TCGA数据集上的实验表明，模型在C-Index性能上优于先进方法3.4%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了病理与基因组数据的不平衡问题，提升了生存预测性能。

Abstract: Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis has become increasingly prominent in
cancer survival prediction. However, existing studies mainly utilize
multi-instance learning to aggregate patch-level features, neglecting the
information loss of contextual and hierarchical details within pathology
images. Furthermore, the disparity in data granularity and dimensionality
between pathology and genomics leads to a significant modality imbalance. The
high spatial resolution inherent in pathology data renders it a dominant role
while overshadowing genomics in multimodal integration. In this paper, we
propose a multimodal survival prediction framework that incorporates hypergraph
learning to effectively capture both contextual and hierarchical details from
pathology images. Moreover, it employs a modality rebalance mechanism and an
interactive alignment fusion strategy to dynamically reweight the contributions
of the two modalities, thereby mitigating the pathology-genomics imbalance.
Quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on five TCGA datasets,
demonstrating that our model outperforms advanced methods by over 3.4\% in
C-Index performance.

Result: 模型在3D空间和字谜推理任务中表现不佳，推理得分与最终答案存在不一致性。

Conclusion: 强调评估推理准确性的重要性，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在通用推理能力上的局限性。

Abstract: Although large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in a wide range of multimodal tasks, their true reasoning
capabilities on human IQ tests remain underexplored. To advance research on the
fluid intelligence of VLMs, we introduce **IQBench**, a new benchmark designed
to evaluate VLMs on standardized visual IQ tests. We focus on evaluating the
reasoning capabilities of VLMs, which we argue are more important than the
accuracy of the final prediction. **Our benchmark is visually centric,
minimizing the dependence on unnecessary textual content**, thus encouraging
models to derive answers primarily from image-based information rather than
learned textual knowledge. To this end, we manually collected and annotated 500
visual IQ questions to **prevent unintentional data leakage during training**.
Unlike prior work that focuses primarily on the accuracy of the final answer,
we evaluate the reasoning ability of the models by assessing their explanations
and the patterns used to solve each problem, along with the accuracy of the
final prediction and human evaluation. Our experiments show that there are
substantial performance disparities between tasks, with models such as
`o4-mini`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, and `claude-3.7-sonnet` achieving the highest
average accuracies of 0.615, 0.578, and 0.548, respectively. However, all
models struggle with 3D spatial and anagram reasoning tasks, highlighting
significant limitations in current VLMs' general reasoning abilities. In terms
of reasoning scores, `o4-mini`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, and `claude-3.7-sonnet`
achieved top averages of 0.696, 0.586, and 0.516, respectively. These results
highlight inconsistencies between the reasoning processes of the models and
their final answers, emphasizing the importance of evaluating the accuracy of
the reasoning in addition to the final predictions.

TLDR: CHRIS方法通过侧视一致性提升单视角RGB图像生成服装人体的真实感，包括侧视法线判别器和多对一梯度计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单视角图像缺乏侧视信息，导致生成结果在全局拓扑和局部表面一致性上不真实。

Method: 1) 侧视法线判别器提升全局合理性；2) 多对一梯度计算（M2O）确保局部表面一致性。

Result: CHRIS在公开基准测试中表现最优，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: CHRIS通过侧视一致性解决了单视角生成中的全局和局部问题，效果显著。

Abstract: Creating a realistic clothed human from a single-view RGB image is crucial
for applications like mixed reality and filmmaking. Despite some progress in
recent years, mainstream methods often fail to fully utilize side-view
information, as the input single-view image contains front-view information
only. This leads to globally unrealistic topology and local surface
inconsistency in side views. To address these, we introduce Clothed Human
Reconstruction with Side View Consistency, namely CHRIS, which consists of 1) A
Side-View Normal Discriminator that enhances global visual reasonability by
distinguishing the generated side-view normals from the ground truth ones; 2) A
Multi-to-One Gradient Computation (M2O) that ensures local surface consistency.
M2O calculates the gradient of a sampling point by integrating the gradients of
the nearby points, effectively acting as a smooth operation. Experimental
results demonstrate that CHRIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on public
benchmarks and outperforms the prior work.

Result: 在单眼表情识别任务中表现优异，尤其在恶劣光照条件下。

Conclusion: MCO-E Net通过多模态协作和异构专家集成，显著提升了识别性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we proposed a Multi-modal Collaborative Optimization and
Expansion Network (MCO-E Net), to use event modalities to resist challenges
such as low light, high exposure, and high dynamic range in single-eye
expression recognition tasks. The MCO-E Net introduces two innovative designs:
Multi-modal Collaborative Optimization Mamba (MCO-Mamba) and Heterogeneous
Collaborative and Expansion Mixture-of-Experts (HCE-MoE). MCO-Mamba, building
upon Mamba, leverages dual-modal information to jointly optimize the model,
facilitating collaborative interaction and fusion of modal semantics. This
approach encourages the model to balance the learning of both modalities and
harness their respective strengths. HCE-MoE, on the other hand, employs a
dynamic routing mechanism to distribute structurally varied experts (deep,
attention, and focal), fostering collaborative learning of complementary
semantics. This heterogeneous architecture systematically integrates diverse
feature extraction paradigms to comprehensively capture expression semantics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed network achieves
competitive performance in the task of single-eye expression recognition,
especially under poor lighting conditions.

TLDR: 提出了一种针对EHPS模型的新型不可察觉黑盒攻击（UBA），通过潜在空间表示生成对抗噪声，无需模型内部知识即可显著增加估计误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EHPS模型多关注估计精度而忽视安全漏洞，且现有攻击方法需白盒访问或生成明显扰动，实用性不足。

Method: 利用自然图像的潜在空间表示生成对抗噪声，并通过迭代优化攻击方向，仅依赖模型输出查询。

Result: UBA平均增加EHPS模型的姿态估计误差17.27%-58.21%，揭示了严重安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 数字人生成系统亟需解决此类安全风险。

Abstract: Expressive human pose and shape (EHPS) estimation is vital for digital human
generation, particularly in live-streaming applications. However, most existing
EHPS models focus primarily on minimizing estimation errors, with limited
attention on potential security vulnerabilities. Current adversarial attacks on
EHPS models often require white-box access (e.g., model details or gradients)
or generate visually conspicuous perturbations, limiting their practicality and
ability to expose real-world security threats. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel Unnoticeable Black-Box Attack (UBA) against EHPS models. UBA
leverages the latent-space representations of natural images to generate an
optimal adversarial noise pattern and iteratively refine its attack potency
along an optimized direction in digital space. Crucially, this process relies
solely on querying the model's output, requiring no internal knowledge of the
EHPS architecture, while guiding the noise optimization toward greater stealth
and effectiveness. Extensive experiments and visual analyses demonstrate the
superiority of UBA. Notably, UBA increases the pose estimation errors of EHPS
models by 17.27%-58.21% on average, revealing critical vulnerabilities. These
findings underscore the urgent need to address and mitigate security risks
associated with digital human generation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务算术通常假设源模型和目标模型从相同的预训练参数初始化，限制了其在跨模型迁移中的应用。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过少样本正交对齐方法，将任务向量对齐到不同预训练目标模型的参数空间，同时保留任务向量的关键属性（如范数和秩）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在跨模型迁移中优于直接应用任务向量，性能接近少样本微调，同时保持了任务向量的模块化和可重用性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效扩展了任务算术的适用范围，为跨模型迁移提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Task arithmetic enables efficient model editing by representing task-specific
changes as vectors in parameter space. Task arithmetic typically assumes that
the source and target models are initialized from the same pre-trained
parameters. This assumption limits its applicability in cross-model transfer
settings, where models are independently pre-trained on different datasets. To
address this challenge, we propose a method based on few-shot orthogonal
alignment, which aligns task vectors to the parameter space of a differently
pre-trained target model. These transformations preserve key properties of task
vectors, such as norm and rank, and are learned using only a small number of
labeled examples. We evaluate the method using two Vision Transformers
pre-trained on YFCC100M and LAION400M, and test on eight classification
datasets. Experimental results show that our method improves transfer accuracy
over direct task vector application and achieves performance comparable to
few-shot fine-tuning, while maintaining the modularity and reusability of task
vectors. Our code is available at

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition (TSR) systems are crucial for autonomous driving but
are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing physical backdoor attacks either
lack stealth, provide inflexible attack control, or ignore emerging
Vision-Large-Language-Models (VLMs). In this paper, we introduce FIGhost, the
first physical-world backdoor attack leveraging fluorescent ink as triggers.
Fluorescent triggers are invisible under normal conditions and activated
stealthily by ultraviolet light, providing superior stealthiness, flexibility,
and untraceability. Inspired by real-world graffiti, we derive realistic
trigger shapes and enhance their robustness via an interpolation-based
fluorescence simulation algorithm. Furthermore, we develop an automated
backdoor sample generation method to support three attack objectives. Extensive
evaluations in the physical world demonstrate FIGhost's effectiveness against
state-of-the-art detectors and VLMs, maintaining robustness under environmental
variations and effectively evading existing defenses.

Motivation: 现有扩散SR方法计算成本高，且通用加速技术未充分利用低层任务特性。

Method: 通过分析扩散SR的频率和空间域特性，提出TSS策略，结合时间动态采样（TDS）和空间动态采样（SDS）。

Result: TSS在多个基准测试中表现优异，仅用一半步骤即超越现有加速方法，MUSIQ分数提升0.2-3.0。

Conclusion: TSS为扩散SR提供高效加速方案，显著减少计算成本并保持性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have gained attention for their success in modeling complex
distributions, achieving impressive perceptual quality in SR tasks. However,
existing diffusion-based SR methods often suffer from high computational costs,
requiring numerous iterative steps for training and inference. Existing
acceleration techniques, such as distillation and solver optimization, are
generally task-agnostic and do not fully leverage the specific characteristics
of low-level tasks like super-resolution (SR). In this study, we analyze the
frequency- and spatial-domain properties of diffusion-based SR methods,
revealing key insights into the temporal and spatial dependencies of
high-frequency signal recovery. Specifically, high-frequency details benefit
from concentrated optimization during early and late diffusion iterations,
while spatially textured regions demand adaptive denoising strategies. Building
on these observations, we propose the Time-Spatial-aware Sampling strategy
(TSS) for the acceleration of Diffusion SR without any extra training cost. TSS
combines Time Dynamic Sampling (TDS), which allocates more iterations to
refining textures, and Spatial Dynamic Sampling (SDS), which dynamically
adjusts strategies based on image content. Extensive evaluations across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TSS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance with significantly fewer iterations, improving MUSIQ scores by 0.2
- 3.0 and outperforming the current acceleration methods with only half the
number of steps.

Result: VFRTok仅用1/8的token即达到竞争性重建质量和最先进生成保真度。

Conclusion: VFRTok通过紧凑连续的时空表示显著提升了视频生成效率和质量。

Abstract: Modern video generation frameworks based on Latent Diffusion Models suffer
from inefficiencies in tokenization due to the Frame-Proportional Information
Assumption. Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates,
causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with
the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information
Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is
proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this
insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that
enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate
training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes
Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content
modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE
effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation
capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal
representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and
state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to
existing tokenizers.

Abstract: Very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery has emerged as a powerful tool
for monitoring marine animals on a large scale. However, existing deep
learning-based whale detection methods usually require manually created,
high-quality bounding box annotations, which are labor-intensive to produce.
Moreover, existing studies often exclude ``uncertain whales'', individuals that
have ambiguous appearances in satellite imagery, limiting the applicability of
these models in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this study
introduces an automated pipeline for detecting beluga whales and harp seals in
VHR satellite imagery. The pipeline leverages point annotations and the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) to generate precise bounding box annotations, which are
used to train YOLOv8 for multiclass detection of certain whales, uncertain
whales, and harp seals. Experimental results demonstrated that SAM-generated
annotations significantly improved detection performance, achieving higher
$\text{F}_\text{1}$-scores compared to traditional buffer-based annotations.
YOLOv8 trained on SAM-labeled boxes achieved an overall
$\text{F}_\text{1}$-score of 72.2% for whales overall and 70.3% for harp seals,
with superior performance in dense scenes. The proposed approach not only
reduces the manual effort required for annotation but also enhances the
detection of uncertain whales, offering a more comprehensive solution for
marine animal monitoring. This method holds great potential for extending to
other species, habitats, and remote sensing platforms, as well as for
estimating whale biometrics, thereby advancing ecological monitoring and
conservation efforts. The codes for our label and detection pipeline are
publicly available at http://github.com/voyagerxvoyagerx/beluga-seeker .

Abstract: Accurate and fine-grained crop yield prediction plays a crucial role in
advancing global agriculture. However, the accuracy of pixel-level yield
estimation based on satellite remote sensing data has been constrained by the
scarcity of ground truth data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
approach called the Multi-Task Crop Yield Prediction Network (MT-CYP-Net). This
framework introduces an effective multi-task feature-sharing strategy, where
features extracted from a shared backbone network are simultaneously utilized
by both crop yield prediction decoders and crop classification decoders with
the ability to fuse information between them. This design allows MT-CYP-Net to
be trained with extremely sparse crop yield point labels and crop type labels,
while still generating detailed pixel-level crop yield maps. Concretely, we
collected 1,859 yield point labels along with corresponding crop type labels
and satellite images from eight farms in Heilongjiang Province, China, in 2023,
covering soybean, maize, and rice crops, and constructed a sparse crop yield
label dataset. MT-CYP-Net is compared with three classical machine learning and
deep learning benchmark methods in this dataset. Experimental results not only
indicate the superiority of MT-CYP-Net compared to previous methods on multiple
types of crops but also demonstrate the potential of deep networks on precise
pixel-level crop yield prediction, especially with limited data labels.

Motivation: 多实例学习（MIL）在数字病理学中广泛用于全切片图像分类，但其是否能准确学习袋级和实例级分类器仍存疑问。现有方法可能引入噪声标签，因此需要改进。

Method: 通过结合伪标签校正能力，增强袋级和实例级学习过程，从弱到强泛化技术中提取信息，以提升双级MIL算法的性能。

Result: 在公共病理数据集上的实验表明，所提方法在袋级和实例级预测上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效填补了MIL与全监督学习之间的差距，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning is the predominant method for Whole Slide Image
classification in digital pathology, enabling the use of slide-level labels to
supervise model training. Although MIL eliminates the tedious fine-grained
annotation process for supervised learning, whether it can learn accurate bag-
and instance-level classifiers remains a question. To address the issue,
instance-level classifiers and instance masks were incorporated to ground the
prediction on supporting patches. These methods, while practically improving
the performance of MIL methods, may potentially introduce noisy labels. We
propose to bridge the gap between commonly used MIL and fully supervised
learning by augmenting both the bag- and instance-level learning processes with
pseudo-label correction capabilities elicited from weak to strong
generalization techniques. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of
dual-level MIL algorithms on both bag- and instance-level predictions.
Experiments on public pathology datasets showcase the advantage of the proposed
methods.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理多样化视觉感知任务时缺乏统一性，因此需要一种能够整合多种任务并提升推理能力的框架。

Method: 设计了多目标认知学习策略和系统任务重构，生成结构化推理过程以分析视觉输入并解决多样化任务。

Result: 在COCO（检测）、ReasonSeg（分割）和CountBench（计数）任务上，VisionReasoner分别比Qwen2.5VL提升了29.1%、22.1%和15.3%。

Conclusion: VisionReasoner展示了作为统一模型的优越性能，能够高效处理多种视觉感知任务。

Abstract: Large vision-language models exhibit inherent capabilities to handle diverse
visual perception tasks. In this paper, we introduce VisionReasoner, a unified
framework capable of reasoning and solving multiple visual perception tasks
within a shared model. Specifically, by designing novel multi-object cognitive
learning strategies and systematic task reformulation, VisionReasoner enhances
its reasoning capabilities to analyze visual inputs, and addresses diverse
perception tasks in a unified framework. The model generates a structured
reasoning process before delivering the desired outputs responding to user
queries. To rigorously assess unified visual perception capabilities, we
evaluate VisionReasoner on ten diverse tasks spanning three critical domains:
detection, segmentation, and counting. Experimental results show that
VisionReasoner achieves superior performance as a unified model, outperforming
Qwen2.5VL by relative margins of 29.1% on COCO (detection), 22.1% on ReasonSeg
(segmentation), and 15.3% on CountBench (counting).

TLDR: 论文提出了AIGVE-60K数据集和LOVE评估指标，用于多维度评估AI生成视频的质量和文本对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成视频在感知质量和文本对齐性上仍有不足，需要可靠且可扩展的自动评估模型。

Method: 构建AIGVE-60K数据集，包含大规模人类标注，并提出基于LMM的LOVE评估指标。

Result: LOVE在AIGVE-60K上表现优异，并能泛化到其他评估基准。

Conclusion: AIGVE-60K数据集和LOVE指标为AI生成视频评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have driven substantial
progress in both text-to-video (T2V) generation and video-to-text (V2T)
interpretation tasks. However, current AI-generated videos (AIGVs) still
exhibit limitations in terms of perceptual quality and text-video alignment.
Therefore, a reliable and scalable automatic model for AIGV evaluation is
desirable, which heavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations.
To this end, we present AIGVE-60K, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for
AI-Generated Video Evaluation, which features (i) comprehensive tasks,
encompassing 3,050 extensive prompts across 20 fine-grained task dimensions,
(ii) the largest human annotations, including 120K mean-opinion scores (MOSs)
and 60K question-answering (QA) pairs annotated on 58,500 videos generated from
30 T2V models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and evaluating for both T2V
generation and V2T interpretation capabilities. Based on AIGVE-60K, we propose
LOVE, a LMM-based metric for AIGV Evaluation from multiple dimensions including
perceptual preference, text-video correspondence, and task-specific accuracy in
terms of both instance level and model level. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that LOVE not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
AIGVE-60K dataset, but also generalizes effectively to a wide range of other
AIGV evaluation benchmarks. These findings highlight the significance of the
AIGVE-60K dataset. Database and codes are anonymously available at

Result: TinyRS-R1在分类、VQA、视觉定位和开放式问答任务中表现优异，内存和延迟需求更低。

Conclusion: TinyRS-R1是首个针对遥感任务的GRPO对齐CoT推理MSLM，展示了小模型在高效推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Remote-sensing applications often run on edge hardware that cannot host
today's 7B-parameter multimodal language models. This paper introduces TinyRS,
the first 2B-parameter multimodal small language model (MSLM) optimized for
remote sensing tasks, and TinyRS-R1, its reasoning-augmented variant. Built
upon Qwen2-VL-2B, TinyRS is trained through a four-stage pipeline: pre-training
on million satellite images, instruction tuning on visual instruction examples,
fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations from the proposed reasoning
dataset, and alignment via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). TinyRS-R1
achieves or surpasses the performance of recent 7B-parameter remote sensing
models across classification, VQA, visual grounding, and open-ended question
answering-while requiring just one-third of the memory and latency. Our
analysis shows that CoT reasoning substantially benefits spatial grounding and
scene understanding, while the non-reasoning TinyRS excels in concise,
latency-sensitive VQA tasks. TinyRS-R1 represents the first domain-specialized
MSLM with GRPO-aligned CoT reasoning for general-purpose remote sensing.

Motivation: 遥感图像解释任务因标记数据稀缺而受限，EarthSynth旨在通过生成合成数据来提升下游任务的性能。

Method: EarthSynth采用Counterfactual Composition训练策略提升数据多样性，并提出R-Filter方法筛选信息丰富的合成数据。

Result: 在开放世界场景中，EarthSynth在场景分类、目标检测和语义分割任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: EarthSynth为遥感图像解释任务提供了一种实用的解决方案，首次探索了多任务生成方法。

Abstract: Remote sensing image (RSI) interpretation typically faces challenges due to
the scarcity of labeled data, which limits the performance of RSI
interpretation tasks. To tackle this challenge, we propose EarthSynth, a
diffusion-based generative foundation model that enables synthesizing
multi-category, cross-satellite labeled Earth observation for downstream RSI
interpretation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, EarthSynth is the first to
explore multi-task generation for remote sensing. EarthSynth, trained on the
EarthSynth-180K dataset, employs the Counterfactual Composition training
strategy to improve training data diversity and enhance category control.
Furthermore, a rule-based method of R-Filter is proposed to filter more
informative synthetic data for downstream tasks. We evaluate our EarthSynth on
scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation in open-world
scenarios, offering a practical solution for advancing RSI interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在重叠关节或快速变化姿态的场景中表现不佳，需要一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用自下而上的范式生成关键点热图，引入KeyCentroids和MaskCentroids，利用高置信度关键点作为动态质心进行像素聚类。

Result: 在CrowdPose、OCHuman和COCO基准测试中表现出色，验证了方法的准确性和运行效率。

Conclusion: KDC方法在复杂场景中具有高效性和通用性，为人体姿态估计和分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: The dynamic movement of the human body presents a fundamental challenge for
human pose estimation and body segmentation. State-of-the-art approaches
primarily rely on combining keypoint heatmaps with segmentation masks but often
struggle in scenarios involving overlapping joints or rapidly changing poses
during instance-level segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose
Keypoints as Dynamic Centroid (KDC), a new centroid-based representation for
unified human pose estimation and instance-level segmentation. KDC adopts a
bottom-up paradigm to generate keypoint heatmaps for both easily
distinguishable and complex keypoints and improves keypoint detection and
confidence scores by introducing KeyCentroids using a keypoint disk. It
leverages high-confidence keypoints as dynamic centroids in the embedding space
to generate MaskCentroids, allowing for swift clustering of pixels to specific
human instances during rapid body movements in live environments. Our
experimental evaluations on the CrowdPose, OCHuman, and COCO benchmarks
demonstrate KDC's effectiveness and generalizability in challenging scenarios
in terms of both accuracy and runtime performance. The implementation is

Motivation: 视频内容创作中，视觉与音频的协调不足，导致音视频体验不和谐。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的多模态框架，利用电影数据生成伪数据模拟真实场景。

Result: 方法在定量和主观评估中均优于基线，并研究了不同上下文指导和数据集难度的影响。

Conclusion: 视觉引导的音频高亮任务有效提升了音视频协调性，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a significant increase in video content creation and
consumption. Crafting engaging content requires the careful curation of both
visual and audio elements. While visual cue curation, through techniques like
optimal viewpoint selection or post-editing, has been central to media
production, its natural counterpart, audio, has not undergone equivalent
advancements. This often results in a disconnect between visual and acoustic
saliency. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task: visually-guided
acoustic highlighting, which aims to transform audio to deliver appropriate
highlighting effects guided by the accompanying video, ultimately creating a
more harmonious audio-visual experience. We propose a flexible,
transformer-based multimodal framework to solve this task. To train our model,
we also introduce a new dataset -- the muddy mix dataset, leveraging the
meticulous audio and video crafting found in movies, which provides a form of
free supervision. We develop a pseudo-data generation process to simulate
poorly mixed audio, mimicking real-world scenarios through a three-step process
-- separation, adjustment, and remixing. Our approach consistently outperforms
several baselines in both quantitative and subjective evaluation. We also
systematically study the impact of different types of contextual guidance and
difficulty levels of the dataset. Our project page is here:

*Ranit Karmakar,Simon F. Nørrelykke*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的实例分割评估指标SoftPQ，通过引入可调的上限和下限IoU阈值以及子线性惩罚函数，将评估从二元分类转变为连续评分，从而更灵活、稳健地反映分割质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割评估指标（如PQ）依赖硬阈值匹配，忽略了错误之间的质量差异，且无法反映模型的渐进改进。SoftPQ旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SoftPQ通过定义部分匹配区域和应用子线性惩罚函数，将评估扩展为连续评分，同时引入可调IoU阈值以增强灵活性。

Result: 实验表明，SoftPQ能捕捉现有指标忽略的分割质量差异，提供更平滑的评分行为和更有用的模型反馈。

Conclusion: SoftPQ是一种实用且原则性的评估指标，适用于基准测试和模型迭代优化。

Abstract: Segmentation evaluation metrics traditionally rely on binary decision logic:
predictions are either correct or incorrect, based on rigid IoU thresholds.
Detection--based metrics such as F1 and mAP determine correctness at the object
level using fixed overlap cutoffs, while overlap--based metrics like
Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice operate at the pixel level, often
overlooking instance--level structure. Panoptic Quality (PQ) attempts to unify
detection and segmentation assessment, but it remains dependent on
hard-threshold matching--treating predictions below the threshold as entirely
incorrect. This binary framing obscures important distinctions between
qualitatively different errors and fails to reward gradual model improvements.
We propose SoftPQ, a flexible and interpretable instance segmentation metric
that redefines evaluation as a graded continuum rather than a binary
classification. SoftPQ introduces tunable upper and lower IoU thresholds to
define a partial matching region and applies a sublinear penalty function to
ambiguous or fragmented predictions. These extensions allow SoftPQ to exhibit
smoother score behavior, greater robustness to structural segmentation errors,
and more informative feedback for model development and evaluation. Through
controlled perturbation experiments, we show that SoftPQ captures meaningful
differences in segmentation quality that existing metrics overlook, making it a
practical and principled alternative for both benchmarking and iterative model
refinement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督学习研究主要针对干净数据，而噪声数据的应用（如天体物理学、医学影像）仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过训练自监督去噪器构建去噪到噪声的数据课程，结合教师引导的正则化，使模型内化噪声鲁棒性。

Result: 在极端高斯噪声下，线性探测准确率比DINOv2提高4.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过噪声感知预训练实现了无需去噪器的鲁棒性，简化了部署。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has become a powerful solution to extract rich
representations from unlabeled data. Yet, SSL research is mostly focused on
clean, curated and high-quality datasets. As a result, applying SSL on noisy
data remains a challenge, despite being crucial to applications such as
astrophysics, medical imaging, geophysics or finance. In this work, we present
a fully self-supervised framework that enables noise-robust representation
learning without requiring a denoiser at inference or downstream fine-tuning.
Our method first trains an SSL denoiser on noisy data, then uses it to
construct a denoised-to-noisy data curriculum (i.e., training first on
denoised, then noisy samples) for pretraining a SSL backbone (e.g., DINOv2),
combined with a teacher-guided regularization that anchors noisy embeddings to
their denoised counterparts. This process encourages the model to internalize
noise robustness. Notably, the denoiser can be discarded after pretraining,
simplifying deployment. On ImageNet-1k with ViT-B under extreme Gaussian noise
($\sigma=255$, SNR = 0.72 dB), our method improves linear probing accuracy by
4.8% over DINOv2, demonstrating that denoiser-free robustness can emerge from
noise-aware pretraining. The code is available at

TLDR: ACDepth提出了一种鲁棒的单目深度估计方法，通过高质量训练数据生成和域适应解决恶劣天气下的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在恶劣天气下性能下降，主要由于域偏移和场景信息提取困难。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成恶劣天气样本，构建多组退化数据集；采用LoRA适配器微调生成权重；结合循环一致性损失和对抗训练；提出多粒度知识蒸馏策略（MKD）和序数引导蒸馏机制（OGD）。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，ACDepth在夜间和雨天场景的absRel指标上分别比md4all-DD提升2.50%和2.61%。

Conclusion: ACDepth通过数据生成和域适应策略显著提升了恶劣天气下的单目深度估计性能。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is critical for applications such as autonomous
driving and scene reconstruction. While existing methods perform well under
normal scenarios, their performance declines in adverse weather, due to
challenging domain shifts and difficulties in extracting scene information. To
address this issue, we present a robust monocular depth estimation method
called \textbf{ACDepth} from the perspective of high-quality training data
generation and domain adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a one-step
diffusion model for generating samples that simulate adverse weather
conditions, constructing a multi-tuple degradation dataset during training. To
ensure the quality of the generated degradation samples, we employ LoRA
adapters to fine-tune the generation weights of diffusion model. Additionally,
we integrate circular consistency loss and adversarial training to guarantee
the fidelity and naturalness of the scene contents. Furthermore, we elaborate
on a multi-granularity knowledge distillation strategy (MKD) that encourages
the student network to absorb knowledge from both the teacher model and
pretrained Depth Anything V2. This strategy guides the student model in
learning degradation-agnostic scene information from various degradation
inputs. In particular, we introduce an ordinal guidance distillation mechanism
(OGD) that encourages the network to focus on uncertain regions through
differential ranking, leading to a more precise depth estimation. Experimental
results demonstrate that our ACDepth surpasses md4all-DD by 2.50\% for night
scene and 2.61\% for rainy scene on the nuScenes dataset in terms of the absRel
metric.

Conclusion: CompBench为复杂指令引导图像编辑提供了全面评估工具，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: While real-world applications increasingly demand intricate scene
manipulation, existing instruction-guided image editing benchmarks often
oversimplify task complexity and lack comprehensive, fine-grained instructions.
To bridge this gap, we introduce, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed
for complex instruction-guided image editing. CompBench features challenging
editing scenarios that incorporate fine-grained instruction following, spatial
and contextual reasoning, thereby enabling comprehensive evaluation of image
editing models' precise manipulation capabilities. To construct CompBench, We
propose an MLLM-human collaborative framework with tailored task pipelines.
Furthermore, we propose an instruction decoupling strategy that disentangles
editing intents into four key dimensions: location, appearance, dynamics, and
objects, ensuring closer alignment between instructions and complex editing
requirements. Extensive evaluations reveal that CompBench exposes fundamental
limitations of current image editing models and provides critical insights for
the development of next-generation instruction-guided image editing systems.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has demonstrated capabilities across various
domains, but comprehensive benchmarks for agricultural remote sensing (RS)
remain scarce. Existing benchmarks designed for agricultural RS scenarios
exhibit notable limitations, primarily in terms of insufficient scene diversity
in the dataset and oversimplified task design. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AgroMind, a comprehensive agricultural remote sensing benchmark covering four
task dimensions: spatial perception, object understanding, scene understanding,
and scene reasoning, with a total of 13 task types, ranging from crop
identification and health monitoring to environmental analysis. We curate a
high-quality evaluation set by integrating eight public datasets and one
private farmland plot dataset, containing 25,026 QA pairs and 15,556 images.
The pipeline begins with multi-source data preprocessing, including collection,
format standardization, and annotation refinement. We then generate a diverse
set of agriculturally relevant questions through the systematic definition of
tasks. Finally, we employ LMMs for inference, generating responses, and
performing detailed examinations. We evaluated 18 open-source LMMs and 3
closed-source models on AgroMind. Experiments reveal significant performance
gaps, particularly in spatial reasoning and fine-grained recognition, it is
notable that human performance lags behind several leading LMMs. By
establishing a standardized evaluation framework for agricultural RS, AgroMind
reveals the limitations of LMMs in domain knowledge and highlights critical
challenges for future work. Data and code can be accessed at

TLDR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的便携式低场MRI（LF-MRI）的3D重建方法，无需重新训练即可使用，并在多种对比度和分辨率下验证了其准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高场MRI（HF-MRI）在研究和临床中广泛应用，但成本高且不易普及。低场MRI（LF-MRI）是一种经济且易获取的替代方案，但现有工具难以处理其低信噪比和分辨率。

Method: 使用3D U-Net在合成LF-MRI上训练，预测皮质表面的有符号距离函数，并通过几何处理确保拓扑准确性。

Result: 在3mm各向同性T2加权扫描下，LF-MRI与HF-MRI的表面重建结果高度一致（面积相关性r=0.96，皮质分区Dice=0.98，灰质体积r=0.93）。皮质厚度相关性较低（r=0.70）。

Conclusion: 该方法为便携式LF-MRI的皮质表面分析提供了可行方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction of cortical surfaces from MRI for
morphometric analysis is fundamental for understanding brain structure. While
high-field MRI (HF-MRI) is standard in research and clinical settings, its
limited availability hinders widespread use. Low-field MRI (LF-MRI),
particularly portable systems, offers a cost-effective and accessible
alternative. However, existing cortical surface analysis tools are optimized
for high-resolution HF-MRI and struggle with the lower signal-to-noise ratio
and resolution of LF-MRI. In this work, we present a machine learning method
for 3D reconstruction and analysis of portable LF-MRI across a range of
contrasts and resolutions. Our method works "out of the box" without
retraining. It uses a 3D U-Net trained on synthetic LF-MRI to predict signed
distance functions of cortical surfaces, followed by geometric processing to
ensure topological accuracy. We evaluate our method using paired HF/LF-MRI
scans of the same subjects, showing that LF-MRI surface reconstruction accuracy
depends on acquisition parameters, including contrast type (T1 vs T2),
orientation (axial vs isotropic), and resolution. A 3mm isotropic T2-weighted
scan acquired in under 4 minutes, yields strong agreement with HF-derived
surfaces: surface area correlates at r=0.96, cortical parcellations reach
Dice=0.98, and gray matter volume achieves r=0.93. Cortical thickness remains
more challenging with correlations up to r=0.70, reflecting the difficulty of
sub-mm precision with 3mm voxels. We further validate our method on challenging
postmortem LF-MRI, demonstrating its robustness. Our method represents a step
toward enabling cortical surface analysis on portable LF-MRI. Code is available

Abstract: The diffusion model has provided a strong tool for implementing text-to-image
(T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation. Recently, topology and texture
control are popular explorations, e.g., ControlNet, IP-Adapter, Ctrl-X, and
DSG. These methods explicitly consider high-fidelity controllable editing based
on external signals or diffusion feature manipulations. As for diversity, they
directly choose different noise latents. However, the diffused noise is capable
of implicitly representing the topological and textural manifold of the
corresponding image. Moreover, it's an effective workbench to conduct the
trade-off between content preservation and controllable variations. Previous
T2I and I2I diffusion works do not explore the information within the
compressed contextual latent. In this paper, we first propose a plug-and-play
noise finetune NOFT module employed by Stable Diffusion to generate highly
correlated and diverse images. We fine-tune seed noise or inverse noise through
an optimal-transported (OT) information bottleneck (IB) with around only 14K
trainable parameters and 10 minutes of training. Our test-time NOFT is good at
producing high-fidelity image variations considering topology and texture
alignments. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NOFT is a powerful
general reimagine approach to efficiently fine-tune the 2D/3D AIGC assets with
text or image guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs和VLMs在视频理解中表现出强大的推理和泛化能力，但其在视频编辑中的应用尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入L-Storyboard将视频片段转化为结构化语言描述，并提出StoryFlow策略将多路径推理转化为收敛选择机制。

Result: 实验表明L-Storyboard提升了视觉信息与语言描述的映射，StoryFlow增强了逻辑一致性和输出稳定性。

Conclusion: LLMs在智能视频编辑中具有巨大潜力，L-Storyboard和StoryFlow为相关任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities in video
understanding; however, their application in video editing remains largely
underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLMs in the
context of video editing. To bridge the gap between visual information and
language-based reasoning, we introduce L-Storyboard, an intermediate
representation that transforms discrete video shots into structured language
descriptions suitable for LLM processing. We categorize video editing tasks
into Convergent Tasks and Divergent Tasks, focusing on three core tasks: Shot
Attributes Classification, Next Shot Selection, and Shot Sequence Ordering. To
address the inherent instability of divergent task outputs, we propose the
StoryFlow strategy, which converts the divergent multi-path reasoning process
into a convergent selection mechanism, effectively enhancing task accuracy and
logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that L-Storyboard
facilitates a more robust mapping between visual information and language
descriptions, significantly improving the interpretability and privacy
protection of video editing tasks. Furthermore, StoryFlow enhances the logical
consistency and output stability in Shot Sequence Ordering, underscoring the
substantial potential of LLMs in intelligent video editing.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种SD地图增强的场景感知与拓扑推理框架（SEPT），通过结合SD地图与BEV特征提升自动驾驶系统的环境理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶在线场景感知和拓扑推理在长距离或遮挡场景中的局限性，减少对高成本HD地图的依赖。

Method: 提出混合特征融合策略，结合SD地图与BEV特征，并设计辅助的交叉感知关键点检测任务。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上显著提升场景感知和拓扑推理性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SEPT框架通过有效整合SD地图先验知识，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的环境理解能力。

Abstract: Online scene perception and topology reasoning are critical for autonomous
vehicles to understand their driving environments, particularly for mapless
driving systems that endeavor to reduce reliance on costly High-Definition (HD)
maps. However, recent advances in online scene understanding still face
limitations, especially in long-range or occluded scenarios, due to the
inherent constraints of onboard sensors. To address this challenge, we propose
a Standard-Definition (SD) Map Enhanced scene Perception and Topology reasoning
(SEPT) framework, which explores how to effectively incorporate the SD map as
prior knowledge into existing perception and reasoning pipelines. Specifically,
we introduce a novel hybrid feature fusion strategy that combines SD maps with
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, considering both rasterized and vectorized
representations, while mitigating potential misalignment between SD maps and
BEV feature spaces. Additionally, we leverage the SD map characteristics to
design an auxiliary intersection-aware keypoint detection task, which further
enhances the overall scene understanding performance. Experimental results on
the large-scale OpenLane-V2 dataset demonstrate that by effectively integrating
SD map priors, our framework significantly improves both scene perception and
topology reasoning, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像融合方法多遵循计算机视觉标准，忽略了医学图像的丰富语义信息，限制了临床应用的潜力。

Method: 构建多模态医学图像-文本数据集，利用BiomedGPT生成文本描述，通过语义交互对齐模块将文本与图像特征在高维空间对齐，采用交叉注意力线性变换映射关系，嵌入文本注入模块进行特征级融合。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定性和定量评估中均表现优异，能保留更多关键医学信息。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入医学先验知识和语义对齐，显著提升了医学图像融合的效果和临床实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion plays a crucial role in medical diagnosis by
integrating complementary information from different modalities to enhance
image readability and clinical applicability. However, existing methods mainly
follow computer vision standards for feature extraction and fusion strategy
formulation, overlooking the rich semantic information inherent in medical
images. To address this limitation, we propose a novel semantic-guided medical
image fusion approach that, for the first time, incorporates medical prior
knowledge into the fusion process. Specifically, we construct a publicly
available multimodal medical image-text dataset, upon which text descriptions
generated by BiomedGPT are encoded and semantically aligned with image features
in a high-dimensional space via a semantic interaction alignment module. During
this process, a cross attention based linear transformation automatically maps
the relationship between textual and visual features to facilitate
comprehensive learning. The aligned features are then embedded into a
text-injection module for further feature-level fusion. Unlike traditional
methods, we further generate diagnostic reports from the fused images to assess
the preservation of medical information. Additionally, we design a medical
semantic loss function to enhance the retention of textual cues from the source
images. Experimental results on test datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations while preserving more critical medical information.

TLDR: LLaVA-4D提出了一种新的时空提示框架，用于4D场景理解，通过动态感知的4D坐标嵌入增强大模型对静态背景和动态对象的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D大模型仅能理解静态背景，无法捕捉动态对象，因此需要一种新的时空表示方法。

Method: 提出LLaVA-4D框架，将3D位置和1D时间编码为动态感知的4D坐标嵌入，并嵌入到视觉特征中。

Result: 实验证明该方法在4D场景理解任务中有效，能区分背景和动态对象。

Conclusion: LLaVA-4D通过时空提示显著提升了大模型对物理世界的动态场景理解能力。

Abstract: Despite achieving significant progress in 2D image understanding, large
multimodal models (LMMs) struggle in the physical world due to the lack of
spatial representation. Typically, existing 3D LMMs mainly embed 3D positions
as fixed spatial prompts within visual features to represent the scene.
However, these methods are limited to understanding the static background and
fail to capture temporally varying dynamic objects. In this paper, we propose
LLaVA-4D, a general LMM framework with a novel spatiotemporal prompt for visual
representation in 4D scene understanding. The spatiotemporal prompt is
generated by encoding 3D position and 1D time into a dynamic-aware 4D
coordinate embedding. Moreover, we demonstrate that spatial and temporal
components disentangled from visual features are more effective in
distinguishing the background from objects. This motivates embedding the 4D
spatiotemporal prompt into these features to enhance the dynamic scene
representation. By aligning visual spatiotemporal embeddings with language
embeddings, LMMs gain the ability to understand both spatial and temporal
characteristics of static background and dynamic objects in the physical world.
Additionally, we construct a 4D vision-language dataset with spatiotemporal
coordinate annotations for instruction fine-tuning LMMs. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
different tasks in 4D scene understanding.

Abstract: Existing visual place recognition (VPR) datasets predominantly rely on
vehicle-mounted imagery, lack multimodal diversity and underrepresent dense,
mixed-use street-level spaces, especially in non-Western urban contexts. To
address these gaps, we introduce MMS-VPR, a large-scale multimodal dataset for
street-level place recognition in complex, pedestrian-only environments. The
dataset comprises 78,575 annotated images and 2,512 video clips captured across
207 locations in a ~70,800 $\mathrm{m}^2$ open-air commercial district in
Chengdu, China. Each image is labeled with precise GPS coordinates, timestamp,
and textual metadata, and covers varied lighting conditions, viewpoints, and
timeframes. MMS-VPR follows a systematic and replicable data collection
protocol with minimal device requirements, lowering the barrier for scalable
dataset creation. Importantly, the dataset forms an inherent spatial graph with
125 edges, 81 nodes, and 1 subgraph, enabling structure-aware place
recognition. We further define two application-specific subsets --
Dataset_Edges and Dataset_Points -- to support fine-grained and graph-based
evaluation tasks. Extensive benchmarks using conventional VPR models, graph
neural networks, and multimodal baselines show substantial improvements when
leveraging multimodal and structural cues. MMS-VPR facilitates future research
at the intersection of computer vision, geospatial understanding, and
multimodal reasoning. The dataset is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有Transformer视频增强方法计算和内存需求高，难以部署在边缘设备上，而直接应用现有量化方法会导致性能下降和细节丢失。

Conclusion: PMQ-VE为视频增强任务提供了一种高效的量化解决方案，显著提升了低比特模型的性能，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Multi-frame video enhancement tasks aim to improve the spatial and temporal
resolution and quality of video sequences by leveraging temporal information
from multiple frames, which are widely used in streaming video processing,
surveillance, and generation. Although numerous Transformer-based enhancement
methods have achieved impressive performance, their computational and memory
demands hinder deployment on edge devices. Quantization offers a practical
solution by reducing the bit-width of weights and activations to improve
efficiency. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to video
enhancement tasks often leads to significant performance degradation and loss
of fine details. This stems from two limitations: (a) inability to allocate
varying representational capacity across frames, which results in suboptimal
dynamic range adaptation; (b) over-reliance on full-precision teachers, which
limits the learning of low-bit student models. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a novel quantization method for video enhancement: Progressive
Multi-Frame Quantization for Video Enhancement (PMQ-VE). This framework
features a coarse-to-fine two-stage process: Backtracking-based Multi-Frame
Quantization (BMFQ) and Progressive Multi-Teacher Distillation (PMTD). BMFQ
utilizes a percentile-based initialization and iterative search with pruning
and backtracking for robust clipping bounds. PMTD employs a progressive
distillation strategy with both full-precision and multiple high-bit (INT)
teachers to enhance low-bit models' capacity and quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving
state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks and benchmarks.The code will

Motivation: 解决多条件图像生成任务中如何统一处理不同模态条件的问题，同时保持空间对齐和条件区分。

Method: 提出ContextAR框架，嵌入多种条件到token序列，采用混合位置编码（Rotary和Learnable）和条件上下文感知注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明ContextAR在多条件场景下具有强大的可控性和通用性，性能与现有自回归基线相当。

Conclusion: ContextAR为多条件图像生成提供了一种简洁高效的解决方案，支持推理时任意条件组合。

Abstract: Autoregressive transformers have recently shown impressive image generation
quality and efficiency on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models. Unlike
diffusion architectures, autoregressive models can naturally incorporate
arbitrary modalities into a single, unified token sequence--offering a concise
solution for multi-conditional image generation tasks. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{ContextAR}$, a flexible and effective framework for multi-conditional
image generation. ContextAR embeds diverse conditions (e.g., canny edges, depth
maps, poses) directly into the token sequence, preserving modality-specific
semantics. To maintain spatial alignment while enhancing discrimination among
different condition types, we introduce hybrid positional encodings that fuse
Rotary Position Embedding with Learnable Positional Embedding. We design
Conditional Context-aware Attention to reduces computational complexity while
preserving effective intra-condition perception. Without any fine-tuning,
ContextAR supports arbitrary combinations of conditions during inference time.
Experimental results demonstrate the powerful controllability and versatility
of our approach, and show that the competitive perpormance than diffusion-based
multi-conditional control approaches the existing autoregressive baseline
across diverse multi-condition driven scenarios. Project page:

Result: 实验表明，TSSUN能有效适应异构输入并统一多种任务，性能达到或超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: TSSUN展示了在复杂遥感应用中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，无需任务特定调整。

Abstract: The proliferation of diverse remote sensing data has spurred advancements in
dense prediction tasks, yet significant challenges remain in handling data
heterogeneity. Remote sensing imagery exhibits substantial variability across
temporal, spectral, and spatial (TSS) dimensions, complicating unified data
processing. Current deep learning models for dense prediction tasks, such as
semantic segmentation and change detection, are typically tailored to specific
input-output configurations. Consequently, variations in data dimensionality or
task requirements often lead to significant performance degradation or model
incompatibility, necessitating costly retraining or fine-tuning efforts for
different application scenarios. This paper introduces the
Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Network (TSSUN), a novel architecture
designed for unified representation and modeling of remote sensing data across
diverse TSS characteristics and task types. TSSUN employs a
Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Strategy that leverages meta-information to
decouple and standardize input representations from varied temporal, spectral,
and spatial configurations, and similarly unifies output structures for
different dense prediction tasks and class numbers. Furthermore, a Local-Global
Window Attention mechanism is proposed to efficiently capture both local
contextual details and global dependencies, enhancing the model's adaptability
and feature extraction capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets
demonstrate that a single TSSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous
inputs and unifies various dense prediction tasks. The proposed approach
consistently achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance, highlighting
its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing applications
without requiring task-specific modifications.

Motivation: 尽管LMMs在推理和OCR能力上有显著进步，但在涉及文本丰富图像的复杂逻辑推理任务上的表现仍未充分探索。

Method: 通过从中国国家公务员考试中筛选文本语料库，并开发自动化流程将其转化为多模态样本，生成多样化的图像并手动验证质量。

Result: 评估显示LMMs在多模态推理上仍落后于纯文本输入，且对视觉-文本方向敏感。

Conclusion: LogicOCR有望成为推动多模态推理研究的重要资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly improved
their reasoning and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities. However,
their performance on complex logical reasoning tasks involving text-rich images
remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce LogicOCR, a benchmark
comprising 1,100 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate LMMs' logical
reasoning abilities on text-rich images, while minimizing reliance on
domain-specific knowledge (e.g., mathematics). We construct LogicOCR by
curating a text corpus from the Chinese National Civil Servant Examination and
develop a scalable, automated pipeline to convert it into multimodal samples.
First, we design prompt templates to steer GPT-Image-1 to generate images with
diverse backgrounds, interleaved text-illustration layouts, and varied fonts,
ensuring contextual relevance and visual realism. Then, the generated images
are manually verified, with low-quality examples discarded. We evaluate a range
of representative open-source and proprietary LMMs under both Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) and direct-answer settings. Our multi-dimensional analysis reveals key
insights, such as the impact of test-time scaling, input modality differences,
and sensitivity to visual-text orientation. Notably, LMMs still lag in
multimodal reasoning compared to text-only inputs, indicating that they have
not fully bridged visual reading with reasoning. We hope LogicOCR will serve as
a valuable resource for advancing multimodal reasoning research. The dataset is

traditional geometric optimization with end-to-end neural network training,
leveraging an innovative differentiable neural-optimization iteration operator.
In this framework, point-wise motion flow is first estimated using a neural
network, followed by the construction of a cost function based on the
relationship between point motion and pose in 3D space. The radar pose is then
refined using Gauss-Newton updates. Additionally, we design a dual-stream 4D
radar backbone that integrates multi-scale geometric features and
clustering-based class-aware features to enhance the representation of sparse
4D radar point clouds. Extensive experiments on the VoD and Snail-Radar
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model, which outperforms
recent classical and learning-based approaches. Notably, our method even

TLDR: 提出了一种名为Frequency-Pixel Connect的领域自适应框架，通过在频率空间和像素空间引入目标增强，显著提升了OOD鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决领域适应中OOD鲁棒性不足的问题，避免传统通用增强方法在目标域泛化能力有限的缺陷。

Method: 混合源图像和目标图像的振幅谱和像素内容，生成增强样本，同时保留源图像的语义结构。

Result: 在四个真实世界基准测试中显著优于通用方法和数据集特定的目标增强方法。

Conclusion: Frequency-Pixel Connect是一种数据集无关的方法，具有广泛的适用性，显著提升了跨领域连接性。

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness under domain adaptation settings, where
labeled source data and unlabeled target data come from different
distributions, is a key challenge in real-world applications. A common approach
to improving OOD robustness is through data augmentations. However, in
real-world scenarios, models trained with generic augmentations can only
improve marginally when generalized under distribution shifts toward unlabeled
target domains. While dataset-specific targeted augmentations can address this
issue, they typically require expert knowledge and extensive prior data
analysis to identify the nature of the datasets and domain shift. To address
these challenges, we propose Frequency-Pixel Connect, a domain-adaptation
framework that enhances OOD robustness by introducing a targeted augmentation
in both the frequency space and pixel space. Specifically, we mix the amplitude
spectrum and pixel content of a source image and a target image to generate
augmented samples that introduce domain diversity while preserving the semantic
structure of the source image. Unlike previous targeted augmentation methods
that are both dataset-specific and limited to the pixel space, Frequency-Pixel
Connect is dataset-agnostic, enabling broader and more flexible applicability
beyond natural image datasets. We further analyze the effectiveness of
Frequency-Pixel Connect by evaluating the performance of our method connecting
same-class cross-domain samples while separating different-class examples. We
demonstrate that Frequency-Pixel Connect significantly improves cross-domain
connectivity and outperforms previous generic methods on four diverse
real-world benchmarks across vision, medical, audio, and astronomical domains,
and it also outperforms other dataset-specific targeted augmentation methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, such as GANs and Diffusion

serious concerns about misinformation, deepfakes, and copyright infringement.
Although numerous Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AIGI) detectors have
been proposed, often reporting high accuracy, their effectiveness in real-world
scenarios remains questionable. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIGIBench, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the robustness and
generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors. AIGIBench
simulates real-world challenges through four core tasks: multi-source
generalization, robustness to image degradation, sensitivity to data
augmentation, and impact of test-time pre-processing. It includes 23 diverse
fake image subsets that span both advanced and widely adopted image generation
techniques, along with real-world samples collected from social media and AI
art platforms. Extensive experiments on 11 advanced detectors demonstrate that,
despite their high reported accuracy in controlled settings, these detectors
suffer significant performance drops on real-world data, limited benefits from
common augmentations, and nuanced effects of pre-processing, highlighting the
need for more robust detection strategies. By providing a unified and realistic
evaluation framework, AIGIBench offers valuable insights to guide future

Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence, new forgery
methods are rapidly emerging. Social platforms are flooded with vast amounts of
unlabeled synthetic data and authentic data, making it increasingly challenging
to distinguish real from fake. Due to the lack of labels, existing supervised
detection methods struggle to effectively address the detection of unknown
deepfake methods. Moreover, in open world scenarios, the amount of unlabeled
data greatly exceeds that of labeled data. Therefore, we define a new deepfake
detection generalization task which focuses on how to achieve efficient
detection of large amounts of unlabeled data based on limited labeled data to
simulate a open world scenario. To solve the above mentioned task, we propose a
novel Open-World Deepfake Detection Generalization Enhancement Training
Strategy (OWG-DS) to improve the generalization ability of existing methods.
Our approach aims to transfer deepfake detection knowledge from a small amount
of labeled source domain data to large-scale unlabeled target domain data.
Specifically, we introduce the Domain Distance Optimization (DDO) module to
align different domain features by optimizing both inter-domain and
intra-domain distances. Additionally, the Similarity-based Class Boundary
Separation (SCBS) module is used to enhance the aggregation of similar samples
to ensure clearer class boundaries, while an adversarial training mechanism is
adopted to learn the domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments show that
the proposed deepfake detection generalization enhancement training strategy
excels in cross-method and cross-dataset scenarios, improving the model's
generalization.

Conclusion: DIMM通过解耦多方向运动模型和自适应权重分配，显著提升了高机动性3D物体跟踪的准确性。

Abstract: State estimation is challenging for 3D object tracking with high
maneuverability, as the target's state transition function changes rapidly,
irregularly, and is unknown to the estimator. Existing work based on
interacting multiple model (IMM) achieves more accurate estimation than
single-filter approaches through model combination, aligning appropriate models
for different motion modes of the target object over time. However, two
limitations of conventional IMM remain unsolved. First, the solution space of
the model combination is constrained as the target's diverse kinematic
properties in different directions are ignored. Second, the model combination
weights calculated by the observation likelihood are not accurate enough due to
the measurement uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, DIMM,
to effectively combine estimates from different motion models in each
direction, thus increasing the 3D object tracking accuracy. First, DIMM extends
the model combination solution space of conventional IMM from a hyperplane to a
hypercube by designing a 3D-decoupled multi-hierarchy filter bank, which
describes the target's motion with various-order linear models. Second, DIMM
generates more reliable combination weight matrices through a differentiable
adaptive fusion network for importance allocation rather than solely relying on
the observation likelihood; it contains an attention-based twin delayed deep
deterministic policy gradient (TD3) method with a hierarchical reward.
Experiments demonstrate that DIMM significantly improves the tracking accuracy
of existing state estimation methods by 31.61%~99.23%.

Conclusion: ViCA2证明了紧凑模型在空间智能上的高效性，并公开了模型、代码和数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at general
vision-language tasks, visuospatial cognition - reasoning about spatial
layouts, relations, and dynamics - remains a significant challenge. Existing
models often lack the necessary architectural components and specialized
training data for fine-grained spatial understanding. We introduce ViCA2
(Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant 2), a novel MLLM designed to enhance spatial
reasoning. ViCA2 features a dual vision encoder architecture integrating SigLIP
for semantics and Hiera for spatial structure, coupled with a token ratio
control mechanism for efficiency. We also developed ViCA-322K, a new
large-scale dataset with over 322,000 spatially grounded question-answer pairs
for targeted instruction tuning. On the challenging VSI-Bench benchmark, our
ViCA2-7B model achieves a state-of-the-art average score of 56.8, significantly
surpassing larger open-source models (e.g., LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B, 40.9) and
leading proprietary models (Gemini-1.5 Pro, 45.4). This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving strong visuospatial intelligence
with a compact model. We release ViCA2, its codebase, and the ViCA-322K dataset
to facilitate further research.

Result: 在Urban100数据集上，CDASR在×8缩放时PSNR提升0.15dB，×16时提升0.30dB。

Conclusion: CDASR通过语义信息融合和多组件损失函数，在超分辨率任务中表现出色。

Abstract: This work introduces CLIP-aware Domain-Adaptive Super-Resolution (CDASR), a
novel framework that addresses the critical challenge of domain generalization
in single image super-resolution. By leveraging the semantic capabilities of
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), CDASR achieves unprecedented
performance across diverse domains and extreme scaling factors. The proposed
method integrates CLIP-guided feature alignment mechanism with a meta-learning
inspired few-shot adaptation strategy, enabling efficient knowledge transfer
and rapid adaptation to target domains. A custom domain-adaptive module
processes CLIP features alongside super-resolution features through a
multi-stage transformation process, including CLIP feature processing, spatial
feature generation, and feature fusion. This intricate process ensures
effective incorporation of semantic information into the super-resolution
pipeline. Additionally, CDASR employs a multi-component loss function that
combines pixel-wise reconstruction, perceptual similarity, and semantic
consistency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate CDASR's
superiority, particularly in challenging scenarios. On the Urban100 dataset at
$\times$8 scaling, CDASR achieves a significant PSNR gain of 0.15dB over
existing methods, with even larger improvements of up to 0.30dB observed at
$\times$16 scaling.

Motivation: 现有EEG视觉解码方法依赖扁平神经表示，忽视了大脑的视觉层次结构，ViEEG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ViEEG将视觉刺激分解为轮廓、前景对象和上下文场景三个生物对齐组件，通过跨注意力路由逐步整合EEG特征，并采用分层对比学习与CLIP嵌入对齐。

Conclusion: ViEEG不仅提升了性能，还为AI中基于生物学的脑解码设定了新范式。

Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity into visual representations is a
fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial
intelligence. While EEG-based visual decoding has shown promise due to its
non-invasive, low-cost nature and millisecond-level temporal resolution,
existing methods are limited by their reliance on flat neural representations
that overlook the brain's inherent visual hierarchy. In this paper, we
introduce ViEEG, a biologically inspired hierarchical EEG decoding framework
that aligns with the Hubel-Wiesel theory of visual processing. ViEEG decomposes
each visual stimulus into three biologically aligned components-contour,
foreground object, and contextual scene-serving as anchors for a three-stream
EEG encoder. These EEG features are progressively integrated via
cross-attention routing, simulating cortical information flow from V1 to IT to
the association cortex. We further adopt hierarchical contrastive learning to
align EEG representations with CLIP embeddings, enabling zero-shot object
recognition. Extensive experiments on the THINGS-EEG dataset demonstrate that
ViEEG achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 40.9% Top-1 accuracy in
subject-dependent and 22.9% Top-1 accuracy in cross-subject settings,
surpassing existing methods by over 45%. Our framework not only advances the
performance frontier but also sets a new paradigm for biologically grounded
brain decoding in AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在运动监督中特征表示能力有限，且点跟踪搜索空间大，导致精度低和效率差。

Result: DragLoRA显著提升了拖拽编辑的控制精度和计算效率。

Conclusion: DragLoRA为基于拖拽的图像编辑提供了一种更精确和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Drag-based editing within pretrained diffusion model provides a precise and
flexible way to manipulate foreground objects. Traditional methods optimize the
input feature obtained from DDIM inversion directly, adjusting them iteratively
to guide handle points towards target locations. However, these approaches
often suffer from limited accuracy due to the low representation ability of the
feature in motion supervision, as well as inefficiencies caused by the large
search space required for point tracking. To address these limitations, we
present DragLoRA, a novel framework that integrates LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
adapters into the drag-based editing pipeline. To enhance the training of LoRA
adapters, we introduce an additional denoising score distillation loss which
regularizes the online model by aligning its output with that of the original
model. Additionally, we improve the consistency of motion supervision by
adapting the input features using the updated LoRA, giving a more stable and
accurate input feature for subsequent operations. Building on this, we design
an adaptive optimization scheme that dynamically toggles between two modes,
prioritizing efficiency without compromising precision. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DragLoRA significantly enhances the control precision and
computational efficiency for drag-based image editing. The Codes of DragLoRA
are available at: https://github.com/Sylvie-X/DragLoRA.

Motivation: 动态点云（DPC）能捕捉时空变化，但缺乏动态点云质量评估（DPCQA）研究，阻碍了质量导向应用的发展。

Method: 构建DPCD数据库，包含多种失真类型，通过主观实验获取平均意见分数（MOS），并评估客观指标性能。

Result: 实验表明DPCQA比静态点云更具挑战性，DPCD数据库为相关研究提供了可靠基础。

Conclusion: DPCD数据库公开可用，旨在推动动态点云质量评估的进一步研究。

Abstract: Recently, the advancements in Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR) have driven
the demand for Dynamic Point Clouds (DPC). Unlike static point clouds, DPCs are
capable of capturing temporal changes within objects or scenes, offering a more
accurate simulation of the real world. While significant progress has been made
in the quality assessment research of static point cloud, little study has been
done on Dynamic Point Cloud Quality Assessment (DPCQA), which hinders the
development of quality-oriented applications, such as interframe compression
and transmission in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a
large-scale DPCQA database, named DPCD, which includes 15 reference DPCs and
525 distorted DPCs from seven types of lossy compression and noise distortion.
By rendering these samples to Processed Video Sequences (PVS), a comprehensive
subjective experiment is conducted to obtain Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) from 21
viewers for analysis. The characteristic of contents, impact of various
distortions, and accuracy of MOSs are presented to validate the heterogeneity
and reliability of the proposed database. Furthermore, we evaluate the
performance of several objective metrics on DPCD. The experiment results show
that DPCQA is more challenge than that of static point cloud. The DPCD, which
serves as a catalyst for new research endeavors on DPCQA, is publicly available
at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Olivialyt/DPCD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的低秩更新限制表示能力，影响下游性能。

Method: 引入重要性评分和动态重组机制，融合不重要参数并重新初始化新的低秩对。

Result: 在GLUE基准和图像分类任务中，SRLoRA收敛更快且准确率更高。

Conclusion: SRLoRA在保持轻量化的同时提升了表达能力和性能，适用于广泛的PEFT应用。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) method that injects two trainable low-rank matrices (A and
B) into frozen pretrained models. While efficient, LoRA constrains updates to a
fixed low-rank subspace (Delta W = BA), which can limit representational
capacity and hinder downstream performance. We introduce Subspace Recomposition
in Low-Rank Adaptation (SRLoRA) via importance-based fusion and
reinitialization, a novel approach that enhances LoRA's expressiveness without
compromising its lightweight structure. SRLoRA assigns importance scores to
each LoRA pair (a column of B and the corresponding row of A), and dynamically
recomposes the subspace during training. Less important pairs are fused into
the frozen backbone, freeing capacity to reinitialize new pairs along unused
principal directions derived from the pretrained weight's singular value
decomposition. This mechanism enables continual subspace refreshment and richer
adaptation over time, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. We
evaluate SRLoRA on both language and vision tasks, including the GLUE benchmark
and various image classification datasets. SRLoRA consistently achieves faster
convergence and improved accuracy over standard LoRA, demonstrating its
generality, efficiency, and potential for broader PEFT applications.

TLDR: VIDEORFT通过扩展RFT范式，结合自动生成的CoT数据集和语义一致性奖励，显著提升了MLLM在视频推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频推理是人工智能的重要挑战，现有方法难以处理视频中的复杂逻辑和时空结构。

Method: 采用两阶段RFT：SFT阶段使用自动生成的CoT数据集，RL阶段引入语义一致性奖励。

Result: 在六个视频推理基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: VIDEORFT为视频推理任务提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has shown great promise in achieving
humanlevel reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), and has
recently been extended to MLLMs. Nevertheless, reasoning about videos, which is
a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, remains a persistent challenge due
to the complex logic, temporal and causal structures inherent in video data. To
fill this gap, we propose VIDEORFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT
paradigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.
VIDEORFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement
learning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in
the video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT
datasets. We address this by building a fully automatic CoT curation pipeline.
First, we devise a cognitioninspired prompting strategy to elicit a reasoning
LLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich, structured, and literal
representations of video content. Subsequently, these CoTs are revised by a
visual-language model conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual
consistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two
new datasets - VideoRFT-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To
further strength the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward
that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning with visual
evidence. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent, context-aware
reasoning outputs grounded in visual input. Extensive experiments show that
VIDEORFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six video reasoning
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖RGB输入，缺乏精确的空间理解，且现有深度信息整合方法效果不佳。

Method: SSR框架将深度数据转化为文本推理，并通过知识蒸馏压缩为紧凑嵌入，无需重新训练即可集成到现有模型中。

Result: 实验表明，SSR显著提升了深度信息利用和空间推理能力。

Conclusion: SSR推动了视觉语言模型向更接近人类的多模态理解发展。

Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) for
multi-modal tasks, their reliance on RGB inputs limits precise spatial
understanding. Existing methods for integrating spatial cues, such as point
clouds or depth, either require specialized sensors or fail to effectively
exploit depth information for higher-order reasoning. To this end, we propose a
novel Spatial Sense and Reasoning method, dubbed SSR, a novel framework that
transforms raw depth data into structured, interpretable textual rationales.
These textual rationales serve as meaningful intermediate representations to
significantly enhance spatial reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we leverage
knowledge distillation to compress the generated rationales into compact latent
embeddings, which facilitate resource-efficient and plug-and-play integration
into existing VLMs without retraining. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we
introduce a new dataset named SSR-CoT, a million-scale visual-language
reasoning dataset enriched with intermediate spatial reasoning annotations, and
present SSRBench, a comprehensive multi-task benchmark. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmarks demonstrate SSR substantially improves depth utilization
and enhances spatial reasoning, thereby advancing VLMs toward more human-like
multi-modal understanding. Our project page is at

Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）的少样本分类面临标记样本稀缺的问题，现有方法难以适应HSI的空间几何多样性且缺乏足够的光谱先验知识。

Result: 在四个HSI数据集上的实验表明，S4L-FSC方法在少样本HSI分类中表现出色。

Conclusion: S4L-FSC通过空间和光谱预训练及知识融合，显著提升了少样本HSI分类的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot classification of hyperspectral images (HSI) faces the challenge of
scarce labeled samples. Self-Supervised learning (SSL) and Few-Shot Learning
(FSL) offer promising avenues to address this issue. However, existing methods
often struggle to adapt to the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs and lack
sufficient spectral prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
method, Spectral-Spatial Self-Supervised Learning for Few-Shot Hyperspectral
Image Classification (S4L-FSC), aimed at improving the performance of few-shot
HSI classification. Specifically, we first leverage heterogeneous datasets to
pretrain a spatial feature extractor using a designed Rotation-Mirror
Self-Supervised Learning (RM-SSL) method, combined with FSL. This approach
enables the model to learn the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs using
rotation and mirroring labels as supervisory signals, while acquiring
transferable spatial meta-knowledge through few-shot learning. Subsequently,
homogeneous datasets are utilized to pretrain a spectral feature extractor via
a combination of FSL and Masked Reconstruction Self-Supervised Learning
(MR-SSL). The model learns to reconstruct original spectral information from
randomly masked spectral vectors, inferring spectral dependencies. In parallel,
FSL guides the model to extract pixel-level discriminative features, thereby
embedding rich spectral priors into the model. This spectral-spatial
pretraining method, along with the integration of knowledge from heterogeneous
and homogeneous sources, significantly enhances model performance. Extensive
experiments on four HSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of the proposed S4L-FSC approach for few-shot HSI classification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如分割图和深度图）在控制图像生成时过于刚性，限制了扩散模型的多样性。DGM旨在通过几何先验学习，提供更灵活的控制机制。

Method: DGM通过学习几何矩（geometric moments）来捕捉主题的视觉特征和细节，避免了对全局特征或语义的过度依赖。

Result: 实验表明，DGM在扩散模型中有效平衡了控制与多样性，提供了灵活的生成指导。

Conclusion: DGM为扩散模型提供了一种新颖且有效的细粒度控制方法，克服了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable capabilities in
synthesizing images, but often struggle to provide fine-grained control over
the output. Existing guidance approaches, such as segmentation maps and depth
maps, introduce spatial rigidity that restricts the inherent diversity of
diffusion models. In this work, we introduce Deep Geometric Moments (DGM) as a
novel form of guidance that encapsulates the subject's visual features and
nuances through a learned geometric prior. DGMs focus specifically on the
subject itself compared to DINO or CLIP features, which suffer from
overemphasis on global image features or semantics. Unlike ResNets, which are
sensitive to pixel-wise perturbations, DGMs rely on robust geometric moments.
Our experiments demonstrate that DGM effectively balance control and diversity
in diffusion-based image generation, allowing a flexible control mechanism for
steering the diffusion process.

Abstract: GPT has shown its remarkable success in natural language processing. However,
the language sequence is not sufficient to describe spatial-temporal details in
the visual world. Alternatively, the video sequence is good at capturing such
details. Motivated by this fact, we propose a concise Video-GPT in this paper
by treating video as new language for visual world modeling. By analogy to next
token prediction in GPT, we introduce a novel next clip diffusion paradigm for
pretraining Video-GPT. Different from the previous works, this distinct
paradigm allows Video-GPT to tackle both short-term generation and long-term
prediction, by autoregressively denoising the noisy clip according to the clean
clips in the history. Extensive experiments show our Video-GPT achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on video prediction, which is the key factor
towards world modeling (Physics-IQ Benchmark: Video-GPT 34.97 vs. Kling 23.64
vs. Wan 20.89). Moreover, it can be well adapted on 6 mainstream video tasks in
both video generation and understanding, showing its great generalization

Result: 在四个检索基准测试中，GARE显著提升了对齐精度和对噪声监督的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GARE通过间隙感知的张力缓解机制，有效解决了文本-视频检索中的梯度冲突问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-video retrieval have been largely driven by
contrastive learning frameworks. However, existing methods overlook a key
source of optimization tension: the separation between text and video
distributions in the representation space (referred to as the modality gap),
and the prevalence of false negatives in batch sampling. These factors lead to
conflicting gradients under the InfoNCE loss, impeding stable alignment. To
mitigate this, we propose GARE, a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that introduces
a learnable, pair-specific increment Delta_ij between text t_i and video v_j to
offload the tension from the global anchor representation. We first derive the
ideal form of Delta_ij via a coupled multivariate first-order Taylor
approximation of the InfoNCE loss under a trust-region constraint, revealing it
as a mechanism for resolving gradient conflicts by guiding updates along a
locally optimal descent direction. Due to the high cost of directly computing
Delta_ij, we introduce a lightweight neural module conditioned on the semantic
gap between each video-text pair, enabling structure-aware correction guided by
gradient supervision. To further stabilize learning and promote
interpretability, we regularize Delta using three components: a trust-region
constraint to prevent oscillation, a directional diversity term to promote
semantic coverage, and an information bottleneck to limit redundancy.
Experiments across four retrieval benchmarks show that GARE consistently
improves alignment accuracy and robustness to noisy supervision, confirming the
effectiveness of gap-aware tension mitigation.

TLDR: GlobalGeoTree是一个全球树物种分类数据集，包含630万条地理标记的树木记录，覆盖21,001种物种，并配有Sentinel-2图像和27种环境变量。基于此数据集提出的GeoTreeCLIP模型在零样本和少样本分类上表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过公开数据集和模型，旨在推动树物种分类研究，促进生物多样性创新应用。

Abstract: Global tree species mapping using remote sensing data is vital for
biodiversity monitoring, forest management, and ecological research. However,
progress in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
labeled datasets. To address this, we introduce GlobalGeoTree, a comprehensive
global dataset for tree species classification. GlobalGeoTree comprises 6.3
million geolocated tree occurrences, spanning 275 families, 2,734 genera, and
21,001 species across the hierarchical taxonomic levels. Each sample is paired
with Sentinel-2 image time series and 27 auxiliary environmental variables,
encompassing bioclimatic, geographic, and soil data. The dataset is partitioned
into GlobalGeoTree-6M for model pretraining and curated evaluation subsets,
primarily GlobalGeoTree-10kEval for zero-shot and few-shot benchmarking. To
demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we introduce a baseline model,
GeoTreeCLIP, which leverages paired remote sensing data and taxonomic text
labels within a vision-language framework pretrained on GlobalGeoTree-6M.
Experimental results show that GeoTreeCLIP achieves substantial improvements in
zero- and few-shot classification on GlobalGeoTree-10kEval over existing
advanced models. By making the dataset, models, and code publicly available, we
aim to establish a benchmark to advance tree species classification and foster
innovation in biodiversity research and ecological applications.

TLDR: WaveFT是一种新的参数高效微调方法，通过在小波域学习稀疏更新，优于LoRA等现有方法，尤其在低参数情况下表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算和内存资源有限的情况下，高效适应大型基础模型至关重要。现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）在低参数情况下效果有限。

Method: WaveFT在小波域中学习残差矩阵的稀疏更新，实现对可训练参数的精确控制。

Result: 在个性化文本到图像生成任务中，WaveFT显著优于LoRA和其他PEFT方法，尤其在低参数情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: WaveFT为极端参数高效场景提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficiently adapting large foundation models is critical, especially with
tight compute and memory budgets. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
methods such as LoRA offer limited granularity and effectiveness in
few-parameter regimes. We propose Wavelet Fine-Tuning (WaveFT), a novel PEFT
method that learns highly sparse updates in the wavelet domain of residual
matrices. WaveFT allows precise control of trainable parameters, offering
fine-grained capacity adjustment and excelling with remarkably low parameter
count, potentially far fewer than LoRA's minimum -- ideal for extreme
parameter-efficient scenarios. In order to demonstrate the effect of the
wavelet transform, we compare WaveFT with a special case, called SHiRA, that
entails applying sparse updates directly in the weight domain. Evaluated on
personalized text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion XL as baseline,
WaveFT significantly outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods, especially at low
parameter counts; achieving superior subject fidelity, prompt alignment, and
image diversity.

Abstract: In robotics applications, few-shot segmentation is crucial because it allows
robots to perform complex tasks with minimal training data, facilitating their
adaptation to diverse, real-world environments. However, pixel-level
annotations of even small amount of images is highly time-consuming and costly.
In this paper, we present a novel few-shot binary segmentation method based on

efficient prototype-mixture-based method that treats the background class as a
mixture of distributions. Our approach is simple, training-free, and effective,
accommodating coarse annotations with ease. Compared to existing baselines,
ProMi achieves the best results across different datasets with significant

TLDR: VGGT-SLAM是一种基于未校准单目相机的稠密RGB SLAM系统，通过全局对齐子地图优化重建场景，解决了传统相似变换方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对未校准相机场景重建中的模糊性问题，传统相似变换方法不适用，需探索更高自由度的变换方法。

Method: 使用SL(4)流形优化15自由度单应变换对齐子地图，并考虑闭环约束。

Result: 实验表明，VGGT-SLAM在长视频序列中提升了地图质量，克服了VGGT的高GPU需求限制。

Conclusion: VGGT-SLAM通过全局优化和更高自由度变换，显著提升了未校准相机场景重建的精度和适用性。

Abstract: We present VGGT-SLAM, a dense RGB SLAM system constructed by incrementally
and globally aligning submaps created from the feed-forward scene
reconstruction approach VGGT using only uncalibrated monocular cameras. While
related works align submaps using similarity transforms (i.e., translation,
rotation, and scale), we show that such approaches are inadequate in the case
of uncalibrated cameras. In particular, we revisit the idea of reconstruction
ambiguity, where given a set of uncalibrated cameras with no assumption on the
camera motion or scene structure, the scene can only be reconstructed up to a
15-degrees-of-freedom projective transformation of the true geometry. This
inspires us to recover a consistent scene reconstruction across submaps by
optimizing over the SL(4) manifold, thus estimating 15-degrees-of-freedom
homography transforms between sequential submaps while accounting for potential
loop closure constraints. As verified by extensive experiments, we demonstrate
that VGGT-SLAM achieves improved map quality using long video sequences that
are infeasible for VGGT due to its high GPU requirements.

Conclusion: RLQ框架有效解决了低质量图像对衣物更换重识别任务的负面影响，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: This work focuses on Clothes Changing Re-IDentification (CC-ReID) for the
real world. Existing works perform well with high-quality (HQ) images, but
struggle with low-quality (LQ) where we can have artifacts like pixelation,
out-of-focus blur, and motion blur. These artifacts introduce noise to not only
external biometric attributes (e.g. pose, body shape, etc.) but also corrupt
the model's internal feature representation. Models usually cluster LQ image
features together, making it difficult to distinguish between them, leading to
incorrect matches. We propose a novel framework Robustness against Low-Quality
(RLQ) to improve CC-ReID model on real-world data. RLQ relies on Coarse
Attributes Prediction (CAP) and Task Agnostic Distillation (TAD) operating in
alternate steps in a novel training mechanism. CAP enriches the model with
external fine-grained attributes via coarse predictions, thereby reducing the
effect of noisy inputs. On the other hand, TAD enhances the model's internal
feature representation by bridging the gap between HQ and LQ features, via an
external dataset through task-agnostic self-supervision and distillation. RLQ
outperforms the existing approaches by 1.6%-2.9% Top-1 on real-world datasets
like LaST, and DeepChange, while showing consistent improvement of 5.3%-6%
Top-1 on PRCC with competitive performance on LTCC. *The code will be made

Conclusion: e-STURT数据集将推动事件相机在航天关键任务中的应用，支持抖动感知算法开发。

Abstract: Jitter degrades a spacecraft's fine-pointing ability required for optical
communication, earth observation, and space domain awareness. Development of
jitter estimation and compensation algorithms requires high-fidelity sensor
observations representative of on-board jitter. In this work, we present the
Event-based Star Tracking Under Jitter (e-STURT) dataset -- the first event
camera based dataset of star observations under controlled jitter conditions.
Specialized hardware employed for the dataset emulates an event-camera
undergoing on-board jitter. While the event camera provides asynchronous, high
temporal resolution star observations, systematic and repeatable jitter is
introduced using a micrometer accurate piezoelectric actuator. Various jitter
sources are simulated using distinct frequency bands and utilizing both axes of
motion. Ground-truth jitter is captured in hardware from the piezoelectric
actuator. The resulting dataset consists of 200 sequences and is made publicly
available. This work highlights the dataset generation process, technical
challenges and the resulting limitations. To serve as a baseline, we propose a
high-frequency jitter estimation algorithm that operates directly on the event
stream. The e-STURT dataset will enable the development of jitter aware
algorithms for mission critical event-based space sensing applications.

Abstract: Understanding surveillance video content remains a critical yet underexplored
challenge in vision-language research, particularly due to its real-world
complexity, irregular event dynamics, and safety-critical implications. In this
work, we introduce SurveillanceVQA-589K, the largest open-ended video question
answering benchmark tailored to the surveillance domain. The dataset comprises
589,380 QA pairs spanning 12 cognitively diverse question types, including
temporal reasoning, causal inference, spatial understanding, and anomaly
interpretation, across both normal and abnormal video scenarios. To construct
the benchmark at scale, we design a hybrid annotation pipeline that combines
temporally aligned human-written captions with Large Vision-Language
Model-assisted QA generation using prompt-based techniques. We also propose a
multi-dimensional evaluation protocol to assess contextual, temporal, and
causal comprehension. We evaluate eight LVLMs under this framework, revealing
significant performance gaps, especially in causal and anomaly-related tasks,
underscoring the limitations of current models in real-world surveillance
contexts. Our benchmark provides a practical and comprehensive resource for
advancing video-language understanding in safety-critical applications such as
intelligent monitoring, incident analysis, and autonomous decision-making.

<details>

Motivation: 无人机在低能见度条件下依赖可见光相机的导航系统表现不佳，而热成像相机在黑暗和烟雾中仍能有效工作。因此，研究如何将热成像与现有导航系统结合具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅有效提升了热成像与可见光图像的匹配和配准性能，还可与经典匹配和配准流程兼容。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enable operations in remote and hazardous
environments, yet the visible-spectrum, camera-based navigation systems often
relied upon by UAVs struggle in low-visibility conditions. Thermal cameras,
which capture long-wave infrared radiation, are able to function effectively in
darkness and smoke, where visible-light cameras fail. This work explores
learned cross-spectral (thermal-visible) point features as a means to integrate
thermal imagery into established camera-based navigation systems. Existing
methods typically train a feature network's detection and description outputs
directly, which often focuses training on image regions where thermal and
visible-spectrum images exhibit similar appearance. Aiming to more fully
utilize the available data, we propose a method to train the feature network on
the tasks of matching and registration. We run our feature network on
thermal-visible image pairs, then feed the network response into a
differentiable registration pipeline. Losses are applied to the matching and
registration estimates of this pipeline. Our selected model, trained on the
task of matching, achieves a registration error (corner error) below 10 pixels
for more than 75% of estimates on the MultiPoint dataset. We further
demonstrate that our model can also be used with a classical pipeline for
matching and registration.

Result: 最终模型在标准视频理解任务中显著优于之前的LVLMs。

Conclusion: 时间导向的优化方案可有效提升LVLMs的视频理解能力。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed outstanding advances of large vision-language
models (LVLMs). In order to tackle video understanding, most of them depend
upon their implicit temporal understanding capacity. As such, they have not
deciphered important components that contribute to temporal understanding
ability, which might limit the potential of these LVLMs for video
understanding. In this work, we conduct a thorough empirical study to demystify
crucial components that influence the temporal understanding of LVLMs. Our
empirical study reveals that significant impacts are centered around the
intermediate interface between the visual encoder and the large language model.
Building on these insights, we propose a temporal-oriented recipe that
encompasses temporal-oriented training schemes and an upscaled interface. Our
final model developed using our recipe significantly enhances previous LVLMs on
standard video understanding tasks.

Method: Diff-MM利用预训练的Stable Diffusion的UNet作为特征提取器，采用并行特征提取管道和子模块调优方法，实现多模态互补信息的学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，Diff-MM在RGB-N/D/T/E跟踪中表现优异，其AUC在TNL2K数据集上比OneTracker高出8.3%。

Conclusion: Diff-MM通过利用生成模型的先验知识，实现了统一的多模态跟踪，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multi-modal object tracking integrates auxiliary modalities such as depth,
thermal infrared, event flow, and language to provide additional information
beyond RGB images, showing great potential in improving tracking stabilization
in complex scenarios. Existing methods typically start from an RGB-based
tracker and learn to understand auxiliary modalities only from training data.
Constrained by the limited multi-modal training data, the performance of these
methods is unsatisfactory. To alleviate this limitation, this work proposes a
unified multi-modal tracker Diff-MM by exploiting the multi-modal understanding
capability of the pre-trained text-to-image generation model. Diff-MM leverages
the UNet of pre-trained Stable Diffusion as a tracking feature extractor
through the proposed parallel feature extraction pipeline, which enables
pairwise image inputs for object tracking. We further introduce a multi-modal
sub-module tuning method that learns to gain complementary information between
different modalities. By harnessing the extensive prior knowledge in the
generation model, we achieve a unified tracker with uniform parameters for
RGB-N/D/T/E tracking. Experimental results demonstrate the promising
performance of our method compared with recently proposed trackers, e.g., its
AUC outperforms OneTracker by 8.3% on TNL2K.

Abstract: Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis,
amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital
content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on
AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast
development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is
currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for
forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly
treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model
decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the
public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a
large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video
clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further
introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and
explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and
reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable
rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}}
large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the
latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it
\textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for
explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with
state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and
generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.

Motivation: 解决多退化类型图像恢复任务中因共享参数导致的梯度更新方向冲突问题。

Result: 在去噪、去雾、去雨、运动去模糊和低光增强等任务上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DFPIR通过特征扰动有效解决了多任务干扰问题，为全功能图像恢复提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to recover clear images from various
degradation types and levels with a unified model. Nonetheless, the significant
variations among degradation types present challenges for training a universal
model, often resulting in task interference, where the gradient update
directions of different tasks may diverge due to shared parameters. To address
this issue, motivated by the routing strategy, we propose DFPIR, a novel
all-in-one image restorer that introduces Degradation-aware Feature
Perturbations(DFP) to adjust the feature space to align with the unified
parameter space. In this paper, the feature perturbations primarily include
channel-wise perturbations and attention-wise perturbations. Specifically,
channel-wise perturbations are implemented by shuffling the channels in
high-dimensional space guided by degradation types, while attention-wise
perturbations are achieved through selective masking in the attention space. To
achieve these goals, we propose a Degradation-Guided Perturbation Block (DGPB)
to implement these two functions, positioned between the encoding and decoding
stages of the encoder-decoder architecture. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DFPIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
all-in-one image restoration tasks including image denoising, image dehazing,
image deraining, motion deblurring, and low-light image enhancement. Our codes

Motivation: 现有方法因忽略人体运动序列在时空轴上的任意性，难以处理复杂动作预测。

Method: 提出HaarMoDic网络，采用MR-Haar模块通过2D Haar变换将运动序列投影到混合高分辨率坐标。

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上，HaarMoDic在MPJPE指标上全面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MR-Haar模块通过同时利用时空信息，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: The 3D human pose is vital for modern computer vision and computer graphics,
and its prediction has drawn attention in recent years. 3D human pose
prediction aims at forecasting a human's future motion from the previous
sequence. Ignoring that the arbitrariness of human motion sequences has a firm
origin in transition in both temporal and spatial axes limits the performance
of state-of-the-art methods, leading them to struggle with making precise
predictions on complex cases, e.g., arbitrarily posing or greeting. To
alleviate this problem, a network called HaarMoDic is proposed in this paper,
which utilizes the 2D Haar transform to project joints to higher resolution
coordinates where the network can access spatial and temporal information
simultaneously. An ablation study proves that the significant contributing
module within the HaarModic Network is the Multi-Resolution Haar (MR-Haar)
block. Instead of mining in one of two axes or extracting separately, the
MR-Haar block projects whole motion sequences to a mixed-up coordinate in
higher resolution with 2D Haar Transform, allowing the network to give scope to
information from both axes in different resolutions. With the MR-Haar block,
the HaarMoDic network can make predictions referring to a broader range of
information. Experimental results demonstrate that HaarMoDic surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in every testing interval on the Human3.6M dataset in
the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D几何生成已有显著进展，但3D纹理生成研究不足，需解决参考纹理对齐、几何纹理一致性和局部纹理质量等问题。

Method: 采用数据过滤与增强策略提升纹理保真度，引入ControlNet几何条件控制优化对齐，提取PBR属性生成适用于实际渲染的网格。

Result: MVPainter在三个核心维度上均取得最佳性能，并通过人类评估验证。

Conclusion: MVPainter为3D纹理生成提供了高效解决方案，并开源了完整流程以促进研究。

Abstract: Recently, significant advances have been made in 3D object generation.
Building upon the generated geometry, current pipelines typically employ image
diffusion models to generate multi-view RGB images, followed by UV texture
reconstruction through texture baking. While 3D geometry generation has
improved significantly, supported by multiple open-source frameworks, 3D
texture generation remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically
investigate 3D texture generation through the lens of three core dimensions:
reference-texture alignment, geometry-texture consistency, and local texture
quality. To tackle these issues, we propose MVPainter, which employs data
filtering and augmentation strategies to enhance texture fidelity and detail,
and introduces ControlNet-based geometric conditioning to improve
texture-geometry alignment. Furthermore, we extract physically-based rendering
(PBR) attributes from the generated views to produce PBR meshes suitable for
real-world rendering applications. MVPainter achieves state-of-the-art results
across all three dimensions, as demonstrated by human-aligned evaluations. To
facilitate further research and reproducibility, we also release our full
pipeline as an open-source system, including data construction, model
architecture, and evaluation tools.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种改进的双流架构，通过增强层间互补性模型和引入高效的层间互补注意力机制，显著提升了单图像反射去除的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的双流架构在单图像反射去除中未能充分利用层间互补性，限制了图像分离的质量。

Method: 1. 提出了一种新的层间互补性模型，通过低频和高频组件的交互增强互补性；2. 设计了一种高效的层间互补注意力机制，通过通道级重组和注意力计算优化分离效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个公开数据集上实现了最先进的分离质量，同时显著降低了计算成本和模型复杂度。

Conclusion: 改进的双流架构通过增强层间互补性，显著提升了反射去除的性能和效率。

Abstract: Although dual-stream architectures have achieved remarkable success in single
image reflection removal, they fail to fully exploit inter-layer
complementarity in their physical modeling and network design, which limits the
quality of image separation. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose
two targeted improvements to enhance dual-stream architectures: First, we
introduce a novel inter-layer complementarity model where low-frequency
components extracted from the residual layer interact with the transmission
layer through dual-stream architecture to enhance inter-layer complementarity.
Meanwhile, high-frequency components from the residual layer provide inverse
modulation to both streams, improving the detail quality of the transmission
layer. Second, we propose an efficient inter-layer complementarity attention
mechanism which first cross-reorganizes dual streams at the channel level to
obtain reorganized streams with inter-layer complementary structures, then
performs attention computation on the reorganized streams to achieve better
inter-layer separation, and finally restores the original stream structure for
output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art separation quality on multiple public datasets while
significantly reducing both computational cost and model complexity.

### [311] [Use as Many Surrogates as You Want: Selective Ensemble Attack to Unleash Transferability without Sacrificing Resource Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12644)
*Bo Yang,Hengwei Zhang,Jindong Wang,Yuchen Ren,Chenhao Lin,Chao Shen,Zhengyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出选择性集成攻击（SEA），通过动态选择多样化的预训练模型，解决了传统攻击方法在迁移性和效率之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法因假设所有模型在迭代中相同，导致迁移性和效率的权衡问题。

Method: 提出SEA方法，动态选择多样化模型，固定单次迭代模型数量以保持效率，增加跨迭代多样性以提高迁移性。

Result: 在ImageNet实验中，SEA比现有方法迁移性高8.5%，且适用于商业API和大规模视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: SEA为根据资源需求自适应平衡迁移性和效率提供了可能。

Abstract: In surrogate ensemble attacks, using more surrogate models yields higher
transferability but lower resource efficiency. This practical trade-off between
transferability and efficiency has largely limited existing attacks despite
many pre-trained models are easily accessible online. In this paper, we argue
that such a trade-off is caused by an unnecessary common assumption, i.e., all
models should be identical across iterations. By lifting this assumption, we
can use as many surrogates as we want to unleash transferability without
sacrificing efficiency. Concretely, we propose Selective Ensemble Attack (SEA),
which dynamically selects diverse models (from easily accessible pre-trained
models) across iterations based on our new interpretation of decoupling
within-iteration and cross-iteration model diversity.In this way, the number of
within-iteration models is fixed for maintaining efficiency, while only
cross-iteration model diversity is increased for higher transferability.
Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of SEA in various
scenarios. For example, when dynamically selecting 4 from 20 accessible models,
SEA yields 8.5% higher transferability than existing attacks under the same
efficiency. The superiority of SEA also generalizes to real-world systems, such
as commercial vision APIs and large vision-language models. Overall, SEA opens
up the possibility of adaptively balancing transferability and efficiency
according to specific resource requirements.

Conclusion: AutoMat和STEM2Mat-Bench的提出，为材料科学中显微镜与原子模拟的桥梁搭建迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Machine learning-based interatomic potentials and force fields depend
critically on accurate atomic structures, yet such data are scarce due to the
limited availability of experimentally resolved crystals. Although
atomic-resolution electron microscopy offers a potential source of structural
data, converting these images into simulation-ready formats remains
labor-intensive and error-prone, creating a bottleneck for model training and
validation. We introduce AutoMat, an end-to-end, agent-assisted pipeline that
automatically transforms scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
images into atomic crystal structures and predicts their physical properties.
AutoMat combines pattern-adaptive denoising, physics-guided template retrieval,
symmetry-aware atomic reconstruction, fast relaxation and property prediction
via MatterSim, and coordinated orchestration across all stages. We propose the
first dedicated STEM2Mat-Bench for this task and evaluate performance using
lattice RMSD, formation energy MAE, and structure-matching success rate. By
orchestrating external tool calls, AutoMat enables a text-only LLM to
outperform vision-language models in this domain, achieving closed-loop
reasoning throughout the pipeline. In large-scale experiments over 450
structure samples, AutoMat substantially outperforms existing multimodal large
language models and tools. These results validate both AutoMat and
STEM2Mat-Bench, marking a key step toward bridging microscopy and atomistic
simulation in materials science.The code and dataset are publicly available at

Conclusion: SPKLIP在事件驱动的多模态研究中具有潜力，尤其在神经形态部署中表现出高能效。

Abstract: Spike cameras offer unique sensing capabilities but their sparse,
asynchronous output challenges semantic understanding, especially for Spike
Video-Language Alignment (Spike-VLA) where models like CLIP underperform due to
modality mismatch. We introduce SPKLIP, the first architecture specifically for
Spike-VLA. SPKLIP employs a hierarchical spike feature extractor that
adaptively models multi-scale temporal dynamics in event streams, and uses
spike-text contrastive learning to directly align spike video with language,
enabling effective few-shot learning. A full-spiking visual encoder variant,
integrating SNN components into our pipeline, demonstrates enhanced energy
efficiency. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on benchmark spike
datasets and strong few-shot generalization on a newly contributed real-world
dataset. SPKLIP's energy efficiency highlights its potential for neuromorphic
deployment, advancing event-based multimodal research. The source code and

<details>

Motivation: 现有模型难以预测人类在场景理解任务中的反应时间，而视觉语言模型的发展为建模人类场景理解提供了新机会。

Method: 结合注视点视觉和VLMs，提出F-SUM模型，生成空间分辨的场景理解地图和综合评分。

Result: F-SUM评分与人类反应时间（r=0.47）、注视次数（r=0.51）和描述准确性（r=-0.56）显著相关，优于传统图像指标。

Conclusion: F-SUM为预测人类场景理解时间提供了新方法，并揭示了注视点视觉处理对理解难度的重要性。

Abstract: Although models exist that predict human response times (RTs) in tasks such
as target search and visual discrimination, the development of image-computable
predictors for scene understanding time remains an open challenge. Recent
advances in vision-language models (VLMs), which can generate scene
descriptions for arbitrary images, combined with the availability of
quantitative metrics for comparing linguistic descriptions, offer a new
opportunity to model human scene understanding. We hypothesize that the primary
bottleneck in human scene understanding and the driving source of variability
in response times across scenes is the interaction between the foveated nature
of the human visual system and the spatial distribution of task-relevant visual
information within an image. Based on this assumption, we propose a novel
image-computable model that integrates foveated vision with VLMs to produce a
spatially resolved map of scene understanding as a function of fixation
location (Foveated Scene Understanding Map, or F-SUM), along with an aggregate
F-SUM score. This metric correlates with average (N=17) human RTs (r=0.47) and
number of saccades (r=0.51) required to comprehend a scene (across 277 scenes).
The F-SUM score also correlates with average (N=16) human description accuracy
(r=-0.56) in time-limited presentations. These correlations significantly
exceed those of standard image-based metrics such as clutter, visual
complexity, and scene ambiguity based on language entropy. Together, our work
introduces a new image-computable metric for predicting human response times in
scene understanding and demonstrates the importance of foveated visual
processing in shaping comprehension difficulty.

Motivation: 生成视频模型的快速发展增加了对AI生成内容版权保护的需求，而现有的不可见水印技术在视频生成领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出分层粗到细的自适应匹配机制，将水印图像分块并分配到最相似的视频帧中，再通过3D小波变换增强的Mamba架构实现时空融合。

Result: 实验表明，Safe-Sora在视频质量、水印保真度和鲁棒性方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Safe-Sora为视频水印保护提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，并首次将状态空间模型应用于水印领域。

Abstract: The explosive growth of generative video models has amplified the demand for
reliable copyright preservation of AI-generated content. Despite its popularity
in image synthesis, invisible generative watermarking remains largely
underexplored in video generation. To address this gap, we propose Safe-Sora,
the first framework to embed graphical watermarks directly into the video
generation process. Motivated by the observation that watermarking performance
is closely tied to the visual similarity between the watermark and cover
content, we introduce a hierarchical coarse-to-fine adaptive matching
mechanism. Specifically, the watermark image is divided into patches, each
assigned to the most visually similar video frame, and further localized to the
optimal spatial region for seamless embedding. To enable spatiotemporal fusion
of watermark patches across video frames, we develop a 3D wavelet
transform-enhanced Mamba architecture with a novel spatiotemporal local
scanning strategy, effectively modeling long-range dependencies during
watermark embedding and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first attempt to apply state space models to watermarking, opening new avenues
for efficient and robust watermark protection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Safe-Sora achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of
video quality, watermark fidelity, and robustness, which is largely attributed
to our proposals. We will release our code upon publication.

TLDR: TS-VLM是一种轻量级视觉语言模型，通过TGSSP模块动态融合多视角数据，提升自动驾驶场景理解，同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中存在计算开销大和多视角数据融合效率低的问题，限制了实时部署的可行性。

Method: 提出TS-VLM，引入TGSSP模块，基于输入查询语义动态排序和融合多视角视觉特征，避免依赖高成本注意力机制。

Result: 在DriveLM基准测试中，TS-VLM性能优于现有模型（BLEU-4:56.82），计算成本降低90%，参数仅20.1M。

Conclusion: TS-VLM通过高效的多视角融合和轻量化设计，为自动驾驶实时部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable potential in advancing
autonomous driving by leveraging multi-modal fusion in order to enhance scene
perception, reasoning, and decision-making. Despite their potential, existing
models suffer from computational overhead and inefficient integration of
multi-view sensor data that make them impractical for real-time deployment in
safety-critical autonomous driving applications. To address these shortcomings,
this paper is devoted to designing a lightweight VLM called TS-VLM, which
incorporates a novel Text-Guided SoftSort Pooling (TGSSP) module. By resorting
to semantics of the input queries, TGSSP ranks and fuses visual features from
multiple views, enabling dynamic and query-aware multi-view aggregation without
reliance on costly attention mechanisms. This design ensures the query-adaptive
prioritization of semantically related views, which leads to improved
contextual accuracy in multi-view reasoning for autonomous driving. Extensive
evaluations on the DriveLM benchmark demonstrate that, on the one hand, TS-VLM
outperforms state-of-the-art models with a BLEU-4 score of 56.82, METEOR of
41.91, ROUGE-L of 74.64, and CIDEr of 3.39. On the other hand, TS-VLM reduces
computational cost by up to 90%, where the smallest version contains only 20.1
million parameters, making it more practical for real-time deployment in
autonomous vehicles.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为SiD的数据无关、一步蒸馏框架，用于加速高分辨率文本到图像扩散模型，并通过理论分析和实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在蒸馏高分辨率T2I扩散模型时依赖真实或教师合成图像，且使用CFG导致文本-图像对齐与生成多样性之间的权衡。

Method: 提出Score identity Distillation (SiD)框架，优化少步生成，避免步特定网络，并引入Diffusion GAN对抗损失和两种新指导策略（Zero-CFG和Anti-CFG）。

Result: 在SD1.5和SDXL上实现了一步和少步生成的最先进性能，且对无真实图像的情况具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SiD框架在高效性和性能上表现优异，为T2I扩散模型的加速提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion distillation has emerged as a promising strategy for accelerating
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by distilling a pretrained score network
into a one- or few-step generator. While existing methods have made notable
progress, they often rely on real or teacher-synthesized images to perform well
when distilling high-resolution T2I diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion
XL (SDXL), and their use of classifier-free guidance (CFG) introduces a
persistent trade-off between text-image alignment and generation diversity. We
address these challenges by optimizing Score identity Distillation (SiD) -- a
data-free, one-step distillation framework -- for few-step generation. Backed
by theoretical analysis that justifies matching a uniform mixture of outputs
from all generation steps to the data distribution, our few-step distillation
algorithm avoids step-specific networks and integrates seamlessly into existing
pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SDXL at 1024x1024
resolution. To mitigate the alignment-diversity trade-off when real text-image
pairs are available, we introduce a Diffusion GAN-based adversarial loss
applied to the uniform mixture and propose two new guidance strategies:
Zero-CFG, which disables CFG in the teacher and removes text conditioning in
the fake score network, and Anti-CFG, which applies negative CFG in the fake
score network. This flexible setup improves diversity without sacrificing
alignment. Comprehensive experiments on SD1.5 and SDXL demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in both one-step and few-step generation settings,
along with robustness to the absence of real images. Our efficient PyTorch
implementation, along with the resulting one- and few-step distilled
generators, will be released publicly as a separate branch at
https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD-LSG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像模型的发展，生成不安全、侵权或侵犯隐私内容的风险增加，现有安全干预措施存在不足。

Method: CURE采用Spectral Eraser模块，通过奇异值分解识别并隔离不良概念的特征，单步更新模型权重。

Result: CURE在2秒内高效去除目标概念，对原始生成能力影响小，且抗攻击能力强。

Conclusion: CURE提供了一种快速、可解释且高效的概念遗忘方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: As Text-to-Image models continue to evolve, so does the risk of generating
unsafe, copyrighted, or privacy-violating content. Existing safety
interventions - ranging from training data curation and model fine-tuning to
inference-time filtering and guidance - often suffer from incomplete concept
removal, susceptibility to jail-breaking, computational inefficiency, or
collateral damage to unrelated capabilities. In this paper, we introduce CURE,
a training-free concept unlearning framework that operates directly in the
weight space of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling fast, interpretable, and
highly specific suppression of undesired concepts. At the core of our method is
the Spectral Eraser, a closed-form, orthogonal projection module that
identifies discriminative subspaces using Singular Value Decomposition over
token embeddings associated with the concepts to forget and retain.
Intuitively, the Spectral Eraser identifies and isolates features unique to the
undesired concept while preserving safe attributes. This operator is then
applied in a single step update to yield an edited model in which the target
concept is effectively unlearned - without retraining, supervision, or
iterative optimization. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and
preserving unrelated concepts, we further introduce an Expansion Mechanism for
spectral regularization which selectively modulates singular vectors based on
their relative significance to control the strength of forgetting. All the
processes above are in closed-form, guaranteeing extremely efficient erasure in
only $2$ seconds. Benchmarking against prior approaches, CURE achieves a more
efficient and thorough removal for targeted artistic styles, objects,
identities, or explicit content, with minor damage to original generation
ability and demonstrates enhanced robustness against red-teaming.

Motivation: Mamba模型在视觉任务中表现不佳，主要由于序列模型的三个限制：无法访问全局上下文、长程遗忘问题以及空间建模能力弱。

Method: 提出Mamba-Adaptor，包含Adaptor-T（通过可学习位置增强记忆）和Adaptor-S（多尺度空洞卷积增强空间建模），以解决上述问题。

Result: Mamba-Adaptor在ImageNet和COCO等基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Mamba-Adaptor是一种简单而强大的视觉任务适配器，能够显著提升Mamba模型在视觉任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent State Space Models (SSM), especially Mamba, have demonstrated
impressive performance in visual modeling and possess superior model
efficiency. However, the application of Mamba to visual tasks suffers inferior
performance due to three main constraints existing in the sequential model: 1)
Casual computing is incapable of accessing global context; 2) Long-range
forgetting when computing the current hidden states; 3) Weak spatial structural
modeling due to the transformed sequential input. To address these issues, we
investigate a simple yet powerful vision task Adaptor for Mamba models, which
consists of two functional modules: Adaptor-T and Adaptor-S. When solving the
hidden states for SSM, we apply a lightweight prediction module Adaptor-T to
select a set of learnable locations as memory augmentations to ease long-range
forgetting issues. Moreover, we leverage Adapator-S, composed of multi-scale
dilated convolutional kernels, to enhance the spatial modeling and introduce
the image inductive bias into the feature output. Both modules can enlarge the
context modeling in casual computing, as the output is enhanced by the
inaccessible features. We explore three usages of Mamba-Adaptor: A general
visual backbone for various vision tasks; A booster module to raise the
performance of pretrained backbones; A highly efficient fine-tuning module that
adapts the base model for transfer learning tasks. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of Mamba-Adaptor in three settings. Notably, our
Mamba-Adaptor achieves state-of the-art performance on the ImageNet and COCO
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态3D占用预测的性能受限于无效的融合，主要原因是固定融合策略导致的几何-语义不匹配以及稀疏、噪声标注引起的表面细节丢失。

Method: 提出目标尺度自适应的双向对称检索机制，通过动态调整邻域大小实现跨模态特征对齐；引入基于3D高斯泼溅的体积渲染管道，通过光一致性监督优化2D-3D一致性。

Result: 在nuScenes和SemanticKITTI基准测试中验证了TACOcc的有效性。

Conclusion: TACOcc通过自适应融合和体积渲染监督，显著提升了多模态3D占用预测的精度和细节重建能力。

Abstract: The performance of multi-modal 3D occupancy prediction is limited by
ineffective fusion, mainly due to geometry-semantics mismatch from fixed fusion
strategies and surface detail loss caused by sparse, noisy annotations. The
mismatch stems from the heterogeneous scale and distribution of point cloud and
image features, leading to biased matching under fixed neighborhood fusion. To
address this, we propose a target-scale adaptive, bidirectional symmetric
retrieval mechanism. It expands the neighborhood for large targets to enhance
context awareness and shrinks it for small ones to improve efficiency and
suppress noise, enabling accurate cross-modal feature alignment. This mechanism
explicitly establishes spatial correspondences and improves fusion accuracy.
For surface detail loss, sparse labels provide limited supervision, resulting
in poor predictions for small objects. We introduce an improved volume
rendering pipeline based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which takes fused features
as input to render images, applies photometric consistency supervision, and
jointly optimizes 2D-3D consistency. This enhances surface detail
reconstruction while suppressing noise propagation. In summary, we propose
TACOcc, an adaptive multi-modal fusion framework for 3D semantic occupancy
prediction, enhanced by volume rendering supervision. Experiments on the
nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks validate its effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有数据集仅关注短时视频片段，难以应对实际场景中的长期挑战。

Method: 提出了Long-RVOS数据集，包含2000+长视频，并引入新评估指标；提出了基线方法ReferMo，结合运动信息扩展时间感受野。

Result: 现有方法在长视频任务中表现不佳，而ReferMo显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: Long-RVOS和ReferMo为未来研究提供了更现实的长期视频分割基准。

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to identify, track and
segment the objects in a video based on language descriptions, which has
received great attention in recent years. However, existing datasets remain
focus on short video clips within several seconds, with salient objects visible
in most frames. To advance the task towards more practical scenarios, we
introduce \textbf{Long-RVOS}, a large-scale benchmark for long-term referring
video object segmentation. Long-RVOS contains 2,000+ videos of an average
duration exceeding 60 seconds, covering a variety of objects that undergo
occlusion, disappearance-reappearance and shot changing. The objects are
manually annotated with three different types of descriptions to individually
evaluate the understanding of static attributes, motion patterns and
spatiotemporal relationships. Moreover, unlike previous benchmarks that rely
solely on the per-frame spatial evaluation, we introduce two new metrics to
assess the temporal and spatiotemporal consistency. We benchmark 6
state-of-the-art methods on Long-RVOS. The results show that current approaches
struggle severely with the long-video challenges. To address this, we further
propose ReferMo, a promising baseline method that integrates motion information
to expand the temporal receptive field, and employs a local-to-global
architecture to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies.
Despite simplicity, ReferMo achieves significant improvements over current
methods in long-term scenarios. We hope that Long-RVOS and our baseline can
drive future RVOS research towards tackling more realistic and long-form
videos.

Abstract: We propose SpatialLLM, a novel approach advancing spatial intelligence tasks
in complex urban scenes. Unlike previous methods requiring geographic analysis
tools or domain expertise, SpatialLLM is a unified language model directly
addressing various spatial intelligence tasks without any training,
fine-tuning, or expert intervention. The core of SpatialLLM lies in
constructing detailed and structured scene descriptions from raw spatial data
to prompt pre-trained LLMs for scene-based analysis. Extensive experiments show
that, with our designs, pretrained LLMs can accurately perceive spatial
distribution information and enable zero-shot execution of advanced spatial
intelligence tasks, including urban planning, ecological analysis, traffic
management, etc. We argue that multi-field knowledge, context length, and
reasoning ability are key factors influencing LLM performances in urban
analysis. We hope that SpatialLLM will provide a novel viable perspective for
urban intelligent analysis and management. The code and dataset are available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决病理学中多模态数据（如WSI、基因组学和病理报告）融合的高计算成本、缺失模态的鲁棒性需求，以及下游任务多样性带来的统一模型挑战。

Method: 提出ALTER，一种任意到任意三模态预训练框架，支持WSI、基因组学和病理报告的任何子集预训练，学习跨模态表示。

Conclusion: ALTER通过模态自适应设计和跨模态表示学习，为病理学中的多模态问题提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology and artificial intelligence have
significantly enhanced the utilization of gigapixel whole-slide images and and
additional modalities (e.g., genomics) for pathological diagnosis. Although
deep learning has demonstrated strong potential in pathology, several key
challenges persist: (1) fusing heterogeneous data types requires sophisticated
strategies beyond simple concatenation due to high computational costs; (2)
common scenarios of missing modalities necessitate flexible strategies that
allow the model to learn robustly in the absence of certain modalities; (3) the
downstream tasks in CPath are diverse, ranging from unimodal to multimodal,
cnecessitating a unified model capable of handling all modalities. To address
these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining
framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports. The term "any"
emphasizes ALTER's modality-adaptive design, enabling flexible pretraining with
any subset of modalities, and its capacity to learn robust, cross-modal
representations beyond WSI-centric approaches. We evaluate ALTER across
extensive clinical tasks including survival prediction, cancer subtyping, gene
mutation prediction, and report generation, achieving superior or comparable
performance to state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分利用实例深度范围小于整个场景的潜力，且初始阶段的偏差会累积，限制了深度估计精度的进一步提升。

Method: 提出IA-MVS，通过实例级深度假设范围缩小和细化，结合基于深度连续性的过滤机制，并开发了基于条件概率的置信度估计数学模型。

Result: 在DTU基准测试中达到最先进性能，且无需额外训练负担。

Conclusion: IA-MVS通过实例级优化和数学建模显著提升了深度估计精度和鲁棒性，适用于基于MVSNet的模型。

Abstract: Multi-view stereo (MVS) models based on progressive depth hypothesis
narrowing have made remarkable advancements. However, existing methods haven't
fully utilized the potential that the depth coverage of individual instances is
smaller than that of the entire scene, which restricts further improvements in
depth estimation precision. Moreover, inevitable deviations in the initial
stage accumulate as the process advances. In this paper, we propose
Instance-Adaptive MVS (IA-MVS). It enhances the precision of depth estimation
by narrowing the depth hypothesis range and conducting refinement on each
instance. Additionally, a filtering mechanism based on intra-instance depth
continuity priors is incorporated to boost robustness. Furthermore, recognizing
that existing confidence estimation can degrade IA-MVS performance on point
clouds. We have developed a detailed mathematical model for confidence
estimation based on conditional probability. The proposed method can be widely
applied in models based on MVSNet without imposing extra training burdens. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU benchmark. The source

Motivation: 现有融合方法忽视环境条件和传感器输入的细微变化，难以自适应调整模态权重。

Result: 在自动驾驶和军事目标检测数据集上优于传统融合方法，检测精度更高。

Conclusion: VLC Fusion能有效适应环境变化，提升目标检测性能。

Abstract: Although fusing multiple sensor modalities can enhance object detection
performance, existing fusion approaches often overlook subtle variations in
environmental conditions and sensor inputs. As a result, they struggle to
adaptively weight each modality under such variations. To address this
challenge, we introduce Vision-Language Conditioned Fusion (VLC Fusion), a
novel fusion framework that leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
condition the fusion process on nuanced environmental cues. By capturing
high-level environmental context such as as darkness, rain, and camera
blurring, the VLM guides the model to dynamically adjust modality weights based
on the current scene. We evaluate VLC Fusion on real-world autonomous driving
and military target detection datasets that include image, LIDAR, and mid-wave
infrared modalities. Our experiments show that VLC Fusion consistently
outperforms conventional fusion baselines, achieving improved detection
accuracy in both seen and unseen scenarios.

TLDR: FLASH是一种针对多模态模型的推测解码框架，通过轻量级潜在感知令牌压缩和半自回归解码策略，显著提升了推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言和多模态模型（LLMs和LMMs）的推理速度较慢，尤其是LMMs中视觉输入的低信息密度和冗余性加剧了这一问题。

Method: FLASH利用多模态数据的特性，设计了轻量级潜在感知令牌压缩机制和半自回归解码策略，以加速解码过程。

Result: 实验表明，FLASH在视频字幕生成和视觉指令调优任务中分别实现了2.68倍和2.55倍的加速。

Conclusion: FLASH通过优化视觉令牌处理和生成策略，显著提升了多模态模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Large language and multimodal models (LLMs and LMMs) exhibit strong inference
capabilities but are often limited by slow decoding speeds. This challenge is
especially acute in LMMs, where visual inputs typically comprise more tokens
with lower information density than text -- an issue exacerbated by recent
trends toward finer-grained visual tokenizations to boost performance.
Speculative decoding has been effective in accelerating LLM inference by using
a smaller draft model to generate candidate tokens, which are then selectively
verified by the target model, improving speed without sacrificing output
quality. While this strategy has been extended to LMMs, existing methods
largely overlook the unique properties of visual inputs and depend solely on
text-based draft models. In this work, we propose \textbf{FLASH} (Fast
Latent-Aware Semi-Autoregressive Heuristics), a speculative decoding framework
designed specifically for LMMs, which leverages two key properties of
multimodal data to design the draft model. First, to address redundancy in
visual tokens, we propose a lightweight latent-aware token compression
mechanism. Second, recognizing that visual objects often co-occur within a
scene, we employ a semi-autoregressive decoding strategy to generate multiple
tokens per forward pass. These innovations accelerate draft decoding while
maintaining high acceptance rates, resulting in faster overall inference.
Experiments show that FLASH significantly outperforms prior speculative
decoding approaches in both unimodal and multimodal settings, achieving up to
\textbf{2.68$\times$} speed-up on video captioning and \textbf{2.55$\times$} on
visual instruction tuning tasks compared to the original LMM.

Motivation: 传统方法在视觉生成中存在尺度和空间冗余，导致计算复杂度和内存消耗高。

Method: MVAR引入尺度马尔可夫轨迹和空间马尔可夫注意力，分别限制输入和注意范围，降低复杂度。

Result: 实验显示MVAR在性能相当或更优的同时，GPU内存占用减少3.0倍。

Conclusion: MVAR通过简化条件概率建模，显著提升了视觉生成的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Essential to visual generation is efficient modeling of visual data priors.
Conventional next-token prediction methods define the process as learning the
conditional probability distribution of successive tokens. Recently, next-scale
prediction methods redefine the process to learn the distribution over
multi-scale representations, significantly reducing generation latency.
However, these methods condition each scale on all previous scales and require
each token to consider all preceding tokens, exhibiting scale and spatial
redundancy. To better model the distribution by mitigating redundancy, we
propose Markovian Visual AutoRegressive modeling (MVAR), a novel autoregressive
framework that introduces scale and spatial Markov assumptions to reduce the
complexity of conditional probability modeling. Specifically, we introduce a
scale-Markov trajectory that only takes as input the features of adjacent
preceding scale for next-scale prediction, enabling the adoption of a parallel
training strategy that significantly reduces GPU memory consumption.
Furthermore, we propose spatial-Markov attention, which restricts the attention
of each token to a localized neighborhood of size k at corresponding positions
on adjacent scales, rather than attending to every token across these scales,
for the pursuit of reduced modeling complexity. Building on these improvements,
we reduce the computational complexity of attention calculation from O(N^2) to
O(Nk), enabling training with just eight NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs and eliminating
the need for KV cache during inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
demonstrate that MVAR achieves comparable or superior performance with both
small model trained from scratch and large fine-tuned models, while reducing
the average GPU memory footprint by 3.0x.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于LiDAR的两阶段DETR变换器方法，用于解决稀疏点云数据中的多目标跟踪问题，通过平滑和跟踪两阶段提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR点云数据的稀疏性和不规则性，以及传统跟踪系统在拥挤或快速移动场景中难以保持目标一致性的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：平滑阶段优化检测结果，跟踪阶段使用DETR注意力块关联目标。

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上表现优异，在线模式aMOTA为0.722，aMOTP为0.475，离线模式性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在多目标跟踪中显著优于基线和其他先进模型，尤其在在线模式下表现突出。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking from LiDAR point clouds presents unique challenges due
to the sparse and irregular nature of the data, compounded by the need for
temporal coherence across frames. Traditional tracking systems often rely on
hand-crafted features and motion models, which can struggle to maintain
consistent object identities in crowded or fast-moving scenes. We present a
lidar-based two-staged DETR inspired transformer; a smoother and tracker. The
smoother stage refines lidar object detections, from any off-the-shelf
detector, across a moving temporal window. The tracker stage uses a DETR-based
attention block to maintain tracks across time by associating tracked objects
with the refined detections using the point cloud as context. The model is
trained on the datasets nuScenes and KITTI in both online and offline (forward
peeking) modes demonstrating strong performance across metrics such as
ID-switch and multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA). The numerical results
indicate that the online mode outperforms the lidar-only baseline and SOTA
models on the nuScenes dataset, with an aMOTA of 0.722 and an aMOTP of 0.475,
while the offline mode provides an additional 3 pp aMOTP

Method: 使用街景图像进行大规模视觉感知调查，覆盖五国45种国籍的1000名参与者，分析六项传统和四项新感知指标。

Result: 发现人口统计和人格特质对感知有显著影响，机器学习模型存在高估积极指标和低估消极指标的问题。

Conclusion: 城市规划应考虑本地化和多样化的人口统计及人格特质，避免模型偏差。

Abstract: Understanding people's preferences and needs is crucial for urban planning
decisions, yet current approaches often combine them from multi-cultural and
multi-city populations, obscuring important demographic differences and risking
amplifying biases. We conducted a large-scale urban visual perception survey of
streetscapes worldwide using street view imagery, examining how demographics --
including gender, age, income, education, race and ethnicity, and, for the
first time, personality traits -- shape perceptions among 1,000 participants,
with balanced demographics, from five countries and 45 nationalities. This
dataset, introduced as Street Perception Evaluation Considering Socioeconomics
(SPECS), exhibits statistically significant differences in perception scores in
six traditionally used indicators (safe, lively, wealthy, beautiful, boring,
and depressing) and four new ones we propose (live nearby, walk, cycle, green)
among demographics and personalities. We revealed that location-based
sentiments are carried over in people's preferences when comparing urban
streetscapes with other cities. Further, we compared the perception scores
based on where participants and streetscapes are from. We found that an
off-the-shelf machine learning model trained on an existing global perception
dataset tends to overestimate positive indicators and underestimate negative
ones compared to human responses, suggesting that targeted intervention should
consider locals' perception. Our study aspires to rectify the myopic treatment
of street perception, which rarely considers demographics or personality
traits.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have become increasingly versatile,
accompanied by impressive Optical Character Recognition (OCR) related
capabilities. Existing OCR-related benchmarks emphasize evaluating LMMs'
abilities of relatively simple visual question answering, visual-text parsing,
etc. However, the extent to which LMMs can deal with complex logical reasoning
problems based on OCR cues is relatively unexplored. To this end, we introduce
the Reasoning-OCR benchmark, which challenges LMMs to solve complex reasoning
problems based on the cues that can be extracted from rich visual-text.
Reasoning-OCR covers six visual scenarios and encompasses 150 meticulously
designed questions categorized into six reasoning challenges. Additionally,
Reasoning-OCR minimizes the impact of field-specialized knowledge. Our
evaluation offers some insights for proprietary and open-source LMMs in
different reasoning challenges, underscoring the urgent to improve the
reasoning performance. We hope Reasoning-OCR can inspire and facilitate future
research on enhancing complex reasoning ability based on OCR cues.

Conclusion: PST是一种简单、硬件友好的增强模块，适用于检测和分类任务，能有效平衡计算复杂度和性能。

Abstract: Feature fusion is critical for high-performance vision models but often
incurs prohibitive complexity. However, prevailing attention-based fusion
methods often involve significant computational complexity and implementation
challenges, limiting their efficiency in resource-constrained environments. To
address these issues, we introduce the Pyramid Sparse Transformer (PST), a
lightweight, plug-and-play module that integrates coarse-to-fine token
selection and shared attention parameters to reduce computation while
preserving spatial detail. PST can be trained using only coarse attention and
seamlessly activated at inference for further accuracy gains without
retraining. When added to state-of-the-art real-time detection models, such as
YOLOv11-N/S/M, PST yields mAP improvements of 0.9%, 0.5%, and 0.4% on MS COCO
with minimal latency impact. Likewise, embedding PST into ResNet-18/50/101 as
backbones, boosts ImageNet top-1 accuracy by 6.5%, 1.7%, and 1.0%,
respectively. These results demonstrate PST's effectiveness as a simple,
hardware-friendly enhancement for both detection and classification tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法具有广泛适用性，能显著改进Transformer的训练效果。

Abstract: Transformers have transformed modern machine learning, driving breakthroughs
in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. At the core of
their success lies the attention mechanism, which enables the modeling of
global dependencies among input tokens. However, we reveal that the attention
block in transformers suffers from inherent ill-conditioning, which hampers
gradient-based optimization and leads to inefficient training. To address this,
we develop a theoretical framework that establishes a direct relationship
between the conditioning of the attention block and that of the embedded
tokenized data. Building on this insight, we introduce conditioned embedded
tokens, a method that systematically modifies the embedded tokens to improve
the conditioning of the attention mechanism. Our analysis demonstrates that
this approach significantly mitigates ill-conditioning, leading to more stable
and efficient training. We validate our methodology across various transformer
architectures, achieving consistent improvements in image classification,
object detection, instance segmentation, and natural language processing,
highlighting its broad applicability and effectiveness.

Result: 在开放集识别、闭集分类和分布外检测中表现优于现有方法，提升模型鲁棒性和自监督学习性能。

Conclusion: GradMix能有效提升模型泛化能力，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Open set recognition (OSR) is devised to address the problem of detecting
novel classes during model inference. Even in recent vision models, this
remains an open issue which is receiving increasing attention. Thereby, a
crucial challenge is to learn features that are relevant for unseen categories
from given data, for which these features might not be discriminative. To
facilitate this process and "optimize to learn" more diverse features, we
propose GradMix, a data augmentation method that dynamically leverages
gradient-based attribution maps of the model during training to mask out
already learned concepts. Thus GradMix encourages the model to learn a more
complete set of representative features from the same data source. Extensive
experiments on open set recognition, close set classification, and
out-of-distribution detection reveal that our method can often outperform the
state-of-the-art. GradMix can further increase model robustness to corruptions
as well as downstream classification performance for self-supervised learning,
indicating its benefit for model generalization.

Conclusion: 提出的二次特征对齐方案（SA）有效解决了特征融合问题，适用于实时检测。

Abstract: Multi-head detectors typically employ a features-fused-pyramid-neck for
multi-scale detection and are widely adopted in the industry. However, this
approach faces feature misalignment when representations from different
hierarchical levels of the feature pyramid are forcibly fused point-to-point.
To address this issue, we designed an independent hierarchy pyramid (IHP)
architecture to evaluate the effectiveness of the features-unfused-pyramid-neck
for multi-head detectors. Subsequently, we introduced soft nearest neighbor
interpolation (SNI) with a weight downscaling factor to mitigate the impact of
feature fusion at different hierarchies while preserving key textures.
Furthermore, we present a features adaptive selection method for down sampling
in extended spatial windows (ESD) to retain spatial features and enhance
lightweight convolutional techniques (GSConvE). These advancements culminate in
our secondary features alignment solution (SA) for real-time detection,
achieving state-of-the-art results on Pascal VOC and MS COCO. Code will be

Conclusion: 时间感知的激活工程框架是减少VideoLLMs幻觉的有效方法，无需额外微调。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
video understanding.However, hallucination, where the model generates plausible
yet incorrect outputs, persists as a significant and under-addressed challenge
in the video domain. Among existing solutions, activation engineering has
proven successful in mitigating hallucinations in LLMs and ImageLLMs, yet its
applicability to VideoLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we are the
first to systematically investigate the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms
of activation engineering for mitigating hallucinations in VideoLLMs. We
initially conduct an investigation of the key factors affecting the performance
of activation engineering and find that a model's sensitivity to hallucination
depends on $\textbf{temporal variation}$ rather than task type. Moreover,
selecting appropriate internal modules and dataset for activation engineering
is critical for reducing hallucination. Guided by these findings, we propose a
temporal-aware activation engineering framework for VideoLLMs, which adaptively
identifies and manipulates hallucination-sensitive modules based on the
temporal variation characteristic, substantially mitigating hallucinations
without additional LLM fine-tuning. Experiments across multiple models and
benchmarks demonstrate that our method markedly reduces hallucination in
VideoLLMs, thereby validating the robustness of our findings.

Abstract: Handwritten fonts have a distinct expressive character, but they are often

a dataset of handwritten fonts and demonstrate that it significantly enhances
the readability of the original fonts while preserving their unique aesthetic.
Our method has the potential to improve the readability of handwritten fonts,
which would be helpful for a variety of applications including document

Abstract: Image generation models have achieved widespread applications. As an
instance, the TarFlow model combines the transformer architecture with
Normalizing Flow models, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple

computation, TarFlow's sampling process is extremely slow. In this paper, we
demonstrate that through a series of optimization strategies, TarFlow sampling
can be greatly accelerated by using the Gauss-Seidel-Jacobi (abbreviated as
GS-Jacobi) iteration method. Specifically, we find that blocks in the TarFlow
model have varying importance: a small number of blocks play a major role in
image generation tasks, while other blocks contribute relatively little; some
blocks are sensitive to initial values and prone to numerical overflow, while
others are relatively robust. Based on these two characteristics, we propose
the Convergence Ranking Metric (CRM) and the Initial Guessing Metric (IGM): CRM
is used to identify whether a TarFlow block is "simple" (converges in few
iterations) or "tough" (requires more iterations); IGM is used to evaluate
whether the initial value of the iteration is good. Experiments on four TarFlow
models demonstrate that GS-Jacobi sampling can significantly enhance sampling
efficiency while maintaining the quality of generated images (measured by FID),
achieving speed-ups of 4.53x in Img128cond, 5.32x in AFHQ, 2.96x in
Img64uncond, and 2.51x in Img64cond without degrading FID scores or sample
quality. Code and checkpoints are accessible on

Abstract: Detecting an athlete's position on a route and identifying hold usage are
crucial in various climbing-related applications. However, no climbing dataset
with detailed hold usage annotations exists to our knowledge. To address this
issue, we introduce a dataset of 22 annotated climbing videos, providing
ground-truth labels for hold locations, usage order, and time of use.
Furthermore, we explore the application of keypoint-based 2D pose-estimation
models for detecting hold usage in sport climbing. We determine usage by
analyzing the key points of certain joints and the corresponding overlap with
climbing holds. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art models and analyze their
accuracy on our dataset, identifying and highlighting climbing-specific
challenges. Our dataset and results highlight key challenges in
climbing-specific pose estimation and establish a foundation for future
research toward AI-assisted systems for sports climbing.

Conclusion: 该模型为图像退化合成提供了通用解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Image degradation synthesis is highly desirable in a wide variety of
applications ranging from image restoration to simulating artistic effects.
Existing models are designed to generate one specific or a narrow set of
degradations, which often require user-provided degradation parameters. As a
result, they lack the generalizability to synthesize degradations beyond their
initial design or adapt to other applications. Here we propose the first
universal degradation model that can synthesize a broad spectrum of complex and
realistic degradations containing both homogeneous (global) and inhomogeneous
(spatially varying) components. Our model automatically extracts and
disentangles homogeneous and inhomogeneous degradation features, which are
later used for degradation synthesis without user intervention. A
disentangle-by-compression method is proposed to separate degradation
information from images. Two novel modules for extracting and incorporating
inhomogeneous degradations are created to model inhomogeneous components in
complex degradations. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and adaptability in
film-grain simulation and blind image restoration tasks. The demo video, code,
and dataset of this project will be released upon publication at
github.com/yangwenbo99/content-degradation-disentanglement.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为RobustSeg的两阶段框架，通过HPDM和RRM模块增强多模态鲁棒性，显著提升了多模态语义分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态语义分割在动态环境、传感器故障和噪声干扰下面临挑战，理论与实际性能存在差距。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段预训练多模态教师模型；第二阶段通过HPDM和RRM训练学生模型，利用随机模态丢失和知识蒸馏。

Result: 在三个公开基准测试中，RobustSeg性能优于现有方法，分别提升2.76%、4.56%和0.98%。

Conclusion: RobustSeg通过知识蒸馏和表示正则化有效解决了多模态语义分割的鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Multi-modal semantic segmentation (MMSS) faces significant challenges in
real-world scenarios due to dynamic environments, sensor failures, and noise
interference, creating a gap between theoretical models and practical
performance. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework called
RobustSeg, which enhances multi-modal robustness through two key components:
the Hybrid Prototype Distillation Module (HPDM) and the Representation
Regularization Module (RRM). In the first stage, RobustSeg pre-trains a
multi-modal teacher model using complete modalities. In the second stage, a
student model is trained with random modality dropout while learning from the
teacher via HPDM and RRM. HPDM transforms features into compact prototypes,
enabling cross-modal hybrid knowledge distillation and mitigating bias from
missing modalities. RRM reduces representation discrepancies between the
teacher and student by optimizing functional entropy through the log-Sobolev
inequality. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that
RobustSeg outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements
of +2.76%, +4.56%, and +0.98%, respectively. Code is available at:

Conclusion: ORQA为手术室智能提供了可扩展的统一建模方法，显著推进了多模态手术智能的进步。

Abstract: The real-world complexity of surgeries necessitates surgeons to have deep and
holistic comprehension to ensure precision, safety, and effective
interventions. Computational systems are required to have a similar level of
comprehension within the operating room. Prior works, limited to single-task
efforts like phase recognition or scene graph generation, lack scope and
generalizability. In this work, we introduce ORQA, a novel OR question
answering benchmark and foundational multimodal model to advance OR
intelligence. By unifying all four public OR datasets into a comprehensive
benchmark, we enable our approach to concurrently address a diverse range of OR
challenges. The proposed multimodal large language model fuses diverse OR
signals such as visual, auditory, and structured data, for a holistic modeling
of the OR. Finally, we propose a novel, progressive knowledge distillation
paradigm, to generate a family of models optimized for different speed and
memory requirements. We show the strong performance of ORQA on our proposed
benchmark, and its zero-shot generalization, paving the way for scalable,
unified OR modeling and significantly advancing multimodal surgical
intelligence. We will release our code and data upon acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后处理方法提供的解释过于粗糙，而先验方法需要专用架构和训练过程，限制了其适用性。EPIC旨在弥合这两种方法的差距。

Method: EPIC在预训练模型上运行，无需架构修改，通过原型提供直观解释，结合了后处理和先验技术的优势。

Result: EPIC在CUB-200-2011、Stanford Cars和ImageNet等数据集上表现良好，能够提供清晰、高质量的解释。

Conclusion: EPIC是首个能够完全复制固有可解释模型核心解释能力的后处理方法，为XAI提供了灵活且易于理解的工具。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods generally fall into two categories. Post-hoc
approaches generate explanations for pre-trained models and are compatible with
various neural network architectures. These methods often use feature
importance visualizations, such as saliency maps, to indicate which input
regions influenced the model's prediction. Unfortunately, they typically offer
a coarse understanding of the model's decision-making process. In contrast,
ante-hoc (inherently explainable) methods rely on specially designed model
architectures trained from scratch. A notable subclass of these methods
provides explanations through prototypes, representative patches extracted from
the training data. However, prototype-based approaches have limitations: they
require dedicated architectures, involve specialized training procedures, and
perform well only on specific datasets. In this work, we propose EPIC
(Explanation of Pretrained Image Classification), a novel approach that bridges
the gap between these two paradigms. Like post-hoc methods, EPIC operates on
pre-trained models without architectural modifications. Simultaneously, it
delivers intuitive, prototype-based explanations inspired by ante-hoc
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, EPIC is the first post-hoc method
capable of fully replicating the core explanatory power of inherently
interpretable models. We evaluate EPIC on benchmark datasets commonly used in
prototype-based explanations, such as CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars, alongside
large-scale datasets like ImageNet, typically employed by post-hoc methods.
EPIC uses prototypes to explain model decisions, providing a flexible and
easy-to-understand tool for creating clear, high-quality explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于RGB相机的跟踪算法在高延迟和资源受限环境下表现不佳，事件相机因其低延迟特性成为新的研究方向。

Method: 采用图表示学习从事件流中提取信息，并集成到两种FlashAttention视觉骨干网络中，分别实现慢速（高精度）和快速（低延迟）跟踪。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试（FE240、COESOT、EventVOT）上验证了方法的有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: SFTrack通过慢快跟踪范式和知识蒸馏策略，在低延迟和高精度跟踪任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing tracking algorithms typically rely on low-frame-rate RGB cameras
coupled with computationally intensive deep neural network architectures to
achieve effective tracking. However, such frame-based methods inherently face
challenges in achieving low-latency performance and often fail in
resource-constrained environments. Visual object tracking using bio-inspired
event cameras has emerged as a promising research direction in recent years,
offering distinct advantages for low-latency applications. In this paper, we
propose a novel Slow-Fast Tracking paradigm that flexibly adapts to different
operational requirements, termed SFTrack. The proposed framework supports two
complementary modes, i.e., a high-precision slow tracker for scenarios with
sufficient computational resources, and an efficient fast tracker tailored for
latency-aware, resource-constrained environments. Specifically, our framework
first performs graph-based representation learning from
high-temporal-resolution event streams, and then integrates the learned
graph-structured information into two FlashAttention-based vision backbones,
yielding the slow and fast trackers, respectively. The fast tracker achieves
low latency through a lightweight network design and by producing multiple
bounding box outputs in a single forward pass. Finally, we seamlessly combine
both trackers via supervised fine-tuning and further enhance the fast tracker's
performance through a knowledge distillation strategy. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks, including FE240, COESOT, and EventVOT, demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method across different real-world
scenarios. The source code has been released on

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: CvHeat-DET在事件流目标检测中实现了效率和精度的平衡，代码将开源。

Abstract: Event-based Vision Sensors (EVS) have demonstrated significant advantages
over traditional RGB frame-based cameras in low-light conditions, high-speed
motion capture, and low latency. Consequently, object detection based on EVS
has attracted increasing attention from researchers. Current event stream
object detection algorithms are typically built upon Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) or Transformers, which either capture limited local features
using convolutional filters or incur high computational costs due to the
utilization of self-attention. Recently proposed vision heat conduction
backbone networks have shown a good balance between efficiency and accuracy;
however, these models are not specifically designed for event stream data. They
exhibit weak capability in modeling object contour information and fail to
exploit the benefits of multi-scale features. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a novel dynamic graph induced contour-aware heat conduction
network for event stream based object detection, termed CvHeat-DET. The
proposed model effectively leverages the clear contour information inherent in
event streams to predict the thermal diffusivity coefficients within the heat
conduction model, and integrates hierarchical structural graph features to
enhance feature learning across multiple scales. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets for event stream-based object detection fully validated the
effectiveness of the proposed model. The source code of this paper will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenEvDET.

Motivation: 人类活动复杂多变，但其变异性具有潜在的分层结构，可以从非脚本视频中自然涌现，用于更好地推理内容。

Method: HiERO通过视频片段与叙述描述的对齐，利用分层架构推断上下文、语义和时间关系。

Result: 在多个视频-文本对齐基准测试（EgoMCQ、EgoNLQ）和零样本程序学习任务（EgoProceL、Ego4D Goal-Step）中，HiERO表现优异，甚至大幅超越全监督方法。

Conclusion: 研究证明了利用人类活动分层知识在自我中心视觉中进行多任务推理的有效性。

Abstract: Human activities are particularly complex and variable, and this makes
challenging for deep learning models to reason about them. However, we note
that such variability does have an underlying structure, composed of a
hierarchy of patterns of related actions. We argue that such structure can
emerge naturally from unscripted videos of human activities, and can be
leveraged to better reason about their content. We present HiERO, a
weakly-supervised method to enrich video segments features with the
corresponding hierarchical activity threads. By aligning video clips with their
narrated descriptions, HiERO infers contextual, semantic and temporal reasoning
with an hierarchical architecture. We prove the potential of our enriched
features with multiple video-text alignment benchmarks (EgoMCQ, EgoNLQ) with
minimal additional training, and in zero-shot for procedure learning tasks
(EgoProceL and Ego4D Goal-Step). Notably, HiERO achieves state-of-the-art
performance in all the benchmarks, and for procedure learning tasks it
outperforms fully-supervised methods by a large margin (+12.5% F1 on EgoProceL)
in zero shot. Our results prove the relevance of using knowledge of the
hierarchy of human activities for multiple reasoning tasks in egocentric
vision.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为UnInfo的新方法，用于解决预训练视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在传感器退化导致的分布偏移下的零样本分类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等模型在面对传感器退化（如天气、光线或噪声）时表现不佳，而收集新数据成本高，因此需要一种无需标注数据的测试时适应方法。

Method: 提出了UnInfo方法，通过均匀性感知置信度最大化、信息感知损失平衡和EMA教师的知识蒸馏来解决图像嵌入的“损坏”问题。

Result: 实验表明，UnInfo通过保持均匀性信息，显著提高了传感器退化条件下的分类准确率。

Conclusion: UnInfo是一种有效的测试时适应方法，能够提升CLIP在传感器退化场景下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models such as contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) have demonstrated a remarkable generalizability, which has
enabled a wide range of applications represented by zero-shot classification.
However, vision-language models still suffer when they face datasets with large
gaps from training ones, i.e., distribution shifts. We found that CLIP is
especially vulnerable to sensor degradation, a type of realistic distribution
shift caused by sensor conditions such as weather, light, or noise. Collecting
a new dataset from a test distribution for fine-tuning highly costs since
sensor degradation occurs unexpectedly and has a range of variety. Thus, we
investigate test-time adaptation (TTA) of zero-shot classification, which
enables on-the-fly adaptation to the test distribution with unlabeled test
data. Existing TTA methods for CLIP mainly focus on modifying image and text
embeddings or predictions to address distribution shifts. Although these
methods can adapt to domain shifts, such as fine-grained labels spaces or
different renditions in input images, they fail to adapt to distribution shifts
caused by sensor degradation. We found that this is because image embeddings
are "corrupted" in terms of uniformity, a measure related to the amount of
information. To make models robust to sensor degradation, we propose a novel
method called uniformity-aware information-balanced TTA (UnInfo). To address
the corruption of image embeddings, we introduce uniformity-aware confidence
maximization, information-aware loss balancing, and knowledge distillation from
the exponential moving average (EMA) teacher. Through experiments, we
demonstrate that our UnInfo improves accuracy under sensor degradation by
retaining information in terms of uniformity.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实低质量图像上达到最优性能，并可适应任意输出尺寸。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了复杂退化问题，减少了计算开销，提升了图像恢复效果。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) for
image restoration (IR) tasks due to their ability to model effectively the
distribution of natural images. While significant progress has been made, there
are still key challenges that need to be addressed. First, many approaches
depend on a predefined degradation operator, making them ill-suited for complex
or unknown degradations that deviate from standard analytical models. Second,
many methods struggle to provide a stable guidance in the latent space and
finally most methods convert latent representations back to the pixel domain
for guidance at every sampling iteration, which significantly increases
computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
a wavelet-inspired invertible neural network (INN) that simulates degradations
through a forward transform and reconstructs lost details via the inverse
transform. We further integrate this design into a latent diffusion pipeline
through two proposed approaches: LatentINDIGO-PixelINN, which operates in the
pixel domain, and LatentINDIGO-LatentINN, which stays fully in the latent space
to reduce complexity. Both approaches alternate between updating intermediate
latent variables under the guidance of our INN and refining the INN forward
model to handle unknown degradations. In addition, a regularization step
preserves the proximity of latent variables to the natural image manifold.
Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world low-quality images, and can be readily
adapted to arbitrary output sizes.

Conclusion: MACB-DF方法在多模态深度伪造检测中表现出色，解决了模态不平衡问题并提升了性能。

Abstract: Advances in computer vision and deep learning have blurred the line between
deepfakes and authentic media, undermining multimedia credibility through
audio-visual forgery. Current multimodal detection methods remain limited by
unbalanced learning between modalities. To tackle this issue, we propose an
Audio-Visual Joint Learning Method (MACB-DF) to better mitigate modality
conflicts and neglect by leveraging contrastive learning to assist in
multi-level and cross-modal fusion, thereby fully balancing and exploiting
information from each modality. Additionally, we designed an
orthogonalization-multimodal pareto module that preserves unimodal information
while addressing gradient conflicts in audio-video encoders caused by differing
optimization targets of the loss functions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies conducted on mainstream deepfake datasets demonstrate consistent
performance gains of our model across key evaluation metrics, achieving an
average accuracy of 95.5% across multiple datasets. Notably, our method
exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization capabilities, with absolute
improvements of 8.0% and 7.7% in ACC scores over the previous best-performing
approach when trained on DFDC and tested on DefakeAVMiT and FakeAVCeleb

Conclusion: TFUScapes和DeepTFUS为计算声学、神经技术和深度学习的交叉研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is an emerging modality for
non-invasive brain stimulation and therapeutic intervention, offering
millimeter-scale spatial precision and the ability to target deep brain
structures. However, the heterogeneous and anisotropic nature of the human
skull introduces significant distortions to the propagating ultrasound
wavefront, which require time-consuming patient-specific planning and
corrections using numerical solvers for accurate targeting. To enable
data-driven approaches in this domain, we introduce TFUScapes, the first
large-scale, high-resolution dataset of tFUS simulations through anatomically
realistic human skulls derived from T1-weighted MRI images. We have developed a
scalable simulation engine pipeline using the k-Wave pseudo-spectral solver,
where each simulation returns a steady-state pressure field generated by a
focused ultrasound transducer placed at realistic scalp locations. In addition
to the dataset, we present DeepTFUS, a deep learning model that estimates
normalized pressure fields directly from input 3D CT volumes and transducer
position. The model extends a U-Net backbone with transducer-aware
conditioning, incorporating Fourier-encoded position embeddings and MLP layers
to create global transducer embeddings. These embeddings are fused with U-Net
encoder features via feature-wise modulation, dynamic convolutions, and
cross-attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of
spatially weighted and gradient-sensitive loss functions, enabling it to
approximate high-fidelity wavefields. The TFUScapes dataset is publicly
released to accelerate research at the intersection of computational acoustics,
neurotechnology, and deep learning. The project page is available at

Method: 提出Anti-Inpainting方法，包含多级深度特征提取器、多尺度语义保留数据增强和分布偏差优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，Anti-Inpainting在InpaintGuardBench和CelebA-HQ数据集上对未知条件下的篡改具有显著防御效果，且具备鲁棒性和跨模型迁移性。

Conclusion: Anti-Inpainting为未知条件下的图像篡改提供了有效的主动防御方案，并展示了广泛的适用性。

Abstract: As diffusion-based malicious image manipulation becomes increasingly
prevalent, multiple proactive defense methods are developed to safeguard images
against unauthorized tampering. However, most proactive defense methods only
can safeguard images against manipulation under known conditions, and fail to
protect images from manipulations guided by tampering conditions crafted by
malicious users. To tackle this issue, we propose Anti-Inpainting, a proactive
defense method that achieves adequate protection under unknown conditions
through a triple mechanism to address this challenge. Specifically, a
multi-level deep feature extractor is presented to obtain intricate features
during the diffusion denoising process to improve protective effectiveness. We
design multi-scale semantic-preserving data augmentation to enhance the
transferability of adversarial perturbations across unknown conditions by
multi-scale transformations while preserving semantic integrity. In addition,
we propose a selection-based distribution deviation optimization strategy to
improve the protection of adversarial perturbation against manipulation under
diverse random seeds. Extensive experiments indicate the proactive defensive
performance of Anti-Inpainting against diffusion-based inpainters guided by
unknown conditions in InpaintGuardBench and CelebA-HQ. At the same time, we
also demonstrate the proposed approach's robustness under various image
purification methods and its transferability across different versions of
diffusion models.

receptive field (RF), small asymmetric RFs, or pyramid RFs to learn different
feature representations, still encountering two significant challenges in
medical image classification tasks: 1) They have limitations in capturing
diverse lesion characteristics efficiently, e.g., tiny, coordination, small and
salient, which have unique roles on results, especially imbalanced medical
image classification. 2) The predictions generated by those CNNs are often
unfair/biased, bringing a high risk by employing them to real-world medical
diagnosis conditions. To tackle these issues, we develop a new concept,
Expert-Like Reparameterization of Heterogeneous Pyramid Receptive Fields
(ERoHPRF), to simultaneously boost medical image classification performance and
fairness. This concept aims to mimic the multi-expert consultation mode by
applying the well-designed heterogeneous pyramid RF bags to capture different
lesion characteristics effectively via convolution operations with multiple
heterogeneous kernel sizes. Additionally, ERoHPRF introduces an expert-like
structural reparameterization technique to merge its parameters with the
two-stage strategy, ensuring competitive computation cost and inference speed
through comparisons to a single RF. To manifest the effectiveness and
generalization ability of ERoHPRF, we incorporate it into mainstream efficient
CNN architectures. The extensive experiments show that our method maintains a
better trade-off than state-of-the-art methods in terms of medical image
classification, fairness, and computation overhead. The codes of this paper
will be released soon.

*Hao-Ran Yang,Xiaohui Chen,Chuan-Xian Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有CDGE方法仅提取域不变特征，未能完全解决域偏移问题，GLS理论揭示了其不足。本文旨在从GLS角度重新建模跨域问题。

Method: 引入GLS视角，提出基于截断高斯分布的重要性重加权策略，并结合概率感知的条件算子差异估计方法。

Result: 在标准CDGE任务上的实验表明，该方法在不同骨干模型中均表现出优异的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过GLS校正框架和条件不变学习，有效提升了跨域视线估计的泛化性和适用性。

Abstract: Aiming to generalize the well-trained gaze estimation model to new target
domains, Cross-domain Gaze Estimation (CDGE) is developed for real-world
application scenarios. Existing CDGE methods typically extract the
domain-invariant features to mitigate domain shift in feature space, which is
proved insufficient by Generalized Label Shift (GLS) theory. In this paper, we
introduce a novel GLS perspective to CDGE and modelize the cross-domain problem
by label and conditional shift problem. A GLS correction framework is presented
and a feasible realization is proposed, in which a importance reweighting
strategy based on truncated Gaussian distribution is introduced to overcome the
continuity challenges in label shift correction. To embed the reweighted source
distribution to conditional invariant learning, we further derive a
probability-aware estimation of conditional operator discrepancy. Extensive
experiments on standard CDGE tasks with different backbone models validate the
superior generalization capability across domain and applicability on various
models of proposed method.

Motivation: 偏振图像比标准RGB图像包含更多物理信息，但获取偏振图像成本高且复杂，因此需要从RGB图像推断偏振信息。

Result: 基准确立了RGB到偏振估计的性能上限，揭示了不同模型家族的优缺点。

Conclusion: 论文为偏振估计的未来研究提供了方向，并作为设计和评估新方法的基础资源。

Abstract: Polarization images provide rich physical information that is fundamentally
absent from standard RGB images, benefiting a wide range of computer vision
applications such as reflection separation and material classification.
However, the acquisition of polarization images typically requires additional
optical components, which increases both the cost and the complexity of the
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task: RGB-to-polarization
image estimation, which aims to infer polarization information directly from
RGB images. In this work, we establish the first comprehensive benchmark for
this task by leveraging existing polarization datasets and evaluating a diverse
set of state-of-the-art deep learning models, including both
restoration-oriented and generative architectures. Through extensive
quantitative and qualitative analysis, our benchmark not only establishes the
current performance ceiling of RGB-to-polarization estimation, but also
systematically reveals the respective strengths and limitations of different
model families -- such as direct reconstruction versus generative synthesis,
and task-specific training versus large-scale pre-training. In addition, we
provide some potential directions for future research on polarization
estimation. This benchmark is intended to serve as a foundational resource to
facilitate the design and evaluation of future methods for polarization
estimation from standard RGB inputs.

Conclusion: 3D视觉错觉对机器视觉系统有显著影响，新方法能有效提升深度估计的鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D visual illusion is a perceptual phenomenon where a two-dimensional plane
is manipulated to simulate three-dimensional spatial relationships, making a
flat artwork or object look three-dimensional in the human visual system. In
this paper, we reveal that the machine visual system is also seriously fooled
by 3D visual illusions, including monocular and binocular depth estimation. In
order to explore and analyze the impact of 3D visual illusion on depth
estimation, we collect a large dataset containing almost 3k scenes and 200k
images to train and evaluate SOTA monocular and binocular depth estimation
methods. We also propose a robust depth estimation framework that uses common
sense from a vision-language model to adaptively select reliable depth from
binocular disparity and monocular depth. Experiments show that SOTA monocular,
binocular, and multi-view depth estimation approaches are all fooled by various
3D visual illusions, while our method achieves SOTA performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常忽略RGB图像的辐射信息，导致在几何数据不足的区域配准效果不佳。

Method: CoFF通过两阶段融合3D点云特征和2D图像特征，包括像素级和块级特征融合，以及粗到细的匹配模块。

Conclusion: CoFF通过跨模态特征融合显著提升了点云配准性能，尤其在几何模糊区域表现突出。

Abstract: Point cloud registration has seen significant advancements with the
application of deep learning techniques. However, existing approaches often
overlook the potential of integrating radiometric information from RGB images.
This limitation reduces their effectiveness in aligning point clouds pairs,
especially in regions where geometric data alone is insufficient. When used
effectively, radiometric information can enhance the registration process by
providing context that is missing from purely geometric data. In this paper, we
propose CoFF, a novel Cross-modal Feature Fusion method that utilizes both
point cloud geometry and RGB images for pairwise point cloud registration.
Assuming that the co-registration between point clouds and RGB images is
available, CoFF explicitly addresses the challenges where geometric information
alone is unclear, such as in regions with symmetric similarity or planar
structures, through a two-stage fusion of 3D point cloud features and 2D image
features. It incorporates a cross-modal feature fusion module that assigns
pixel-wise image features to 3D input point clouds to enhance learned 3D point
features, and integrates patch-wise image features with superpoint features to
improve the quality of coarse matching. This is followed by a coarse-to-fine
matching module that accurately establishes correspondences using the fused
features. We extensively evaluate CoFF on four common datasets: 3DMatch,
3DLoMatch, IndoorLRS, and the recently released ScanNet++ datasets. In
addition, we assess CoFF on specific subset datasets containing geometrically
ambiguous cases. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoFF achieves
state-of-the-art registration performance across all benchmarks, including
remarkable registration recalls of 95.9% and 81.6% on the widely-used 3DMatch
and 3DLoMatch datasets, respectively...(Truncated to fit arXiv abstract length)

Result: 实验验证了重建质量，触觉探索策略进一步提升了重建性能。

Conclusion: Touch2Shape模型通过触觉信息有效解决了现有3D扩散模型的局部细节和条件限制问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have made breakthroughs in 3D generation tasks. Current 3D
diffusion models focus on reconstructing target shape from images or a set of
partial observations. While excelling in global context understanding, they
struggle to capture the local details of complex shapes and limited to the
occlusion and lighting conditions. To overcome these limitations, we utilize
tactile images to capture the local 3D information and propose a Touch2Shape
model, which leverages a touch-conditioned diffusion model to explore and
reconstruct the target shape from touch. For shape reconstruction, we have
developed a touch embedding module to condition the diffusion model in creating
a compact representation and a touch shape fusion module to refine the
reconstructed shape. For shape exploration, we combine the diffusion model with
reinforcement learning to train a policy. This involves using the generated
latent vector from the diffusion model to guide the touch exploration policy
training through a novel reward design. Experiments validate the reconstruction
quality thorough both qualitatively and quantitative analysis, and our touch
exploration policy further boosts reconstruction performance.

TLDR: 提出InsCore合成数据集，无需真实图像或人工标注，显著提升工业场景实例分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业应用中因法律限制和领域差异导致的预训练模型性能下降问题。

Method: 基于公式驱动监督学习（FDSL）生成合成数据集InsCore，模拟工业数据特征。

Result: 在五个工业数据集上，InsCore预训练模型性能优于COCO、ImageNet-21k和微调SAM，提升6.2分。

Conclusion: InsCore为工业应用提供高效、免许可的视觉基础模型。

Abstract: Pre-training on real-image datasets has been widely proven effective for
improving instance segmentation. However, industrial applications face two key
challenges: (1) legal and ethical restrictions, such as ImageNet's prohibition
of commercial use, and (2) limited transferability due to the domain gap
between web images and industrial imagery. Even recent vision foundation
models, including the segment anything model (SAM), show notable performance
degradation in industrial settings. These challenges raise critical questions:
Can we build a vision foundation model for industrial applications without
relying on real images or manual annotations? And can such models outperform
even fine-tuned SAM on industrial datasets? To address these questions, we
propose the Instance Core Segmentation Dataset (InsCore), a synthetic
pre-training dataset based on formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL).
InsCore generates fully annotated instance segmentation images that reflect key
characteristics of industrial data, including complex occlusions, dense
hierarchical masks, and diverse non-rigid shapes, distinct from typical web
imagery. Unlike previous methods, InsCore requires neither real images nor
human annotations. Experiments on five industrial datasets show that models
pre-trained with InsCore outperform those trained on COCO and ImageNet-21k, as
well as fine-tuned SAM, achieving an average improvement of 6.2 points in
instance segmentation performance. This result is achieved using only 100k
synthetic images, more than 100 times fewer than the 11 million images in SAM's
SA-1B dataset, demonstrating the data efficiency of our approach. These
findings position InsCore as a practical and license-free vision foundation
model for industrial applications.

Conclusion: ARIW-Framework为图像版权保护提供了一种高效解决方案，显著提升了水印技术的性能。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of large models, copyright protection for generated image
content has become a critical security challenge. Although deep learning
watermarking techniques offer an effective solution for digital image copyright
protection, they still face limitations in terms of visual quality, robustness
and generalization. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive
robust iterative watermarking framework (ARIW-Framework) that achieves
high-quality watermarked images while maintaining exceptional robustness and
generalization performance. Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach to
optimize the encoder for generating robust residuals. The encoder incorporates
noise layers and a decoder to compute robustness weights for residuals under
various noise attacks. By employing a parallel optimization strategy, the
framework enhances robustness against multiple types of noise attacks.
Furthermore, we leverage image gradients to determine the embedding strength at
each pixel location, significantly improving the visual quality of the
watermarked images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior visual quality while exhibiting remarkable robustness and
generalization against noise attacks.

TLDR: PI-VAD是一种弱监督视频异常检测方法，通过引入五种额外模态增强RGB特征，提高复杂场景下的检测可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB特征在区分视觉相似事件（如商店盗窃）时不够显著，限制了检测的可靠性，因此需要多模态增强。

Method: PI-VAD通过伪模态生成模块和跨模态诱导模块，将五种模态（姿态、深度、全景掩码、光流、语言）信息融入RGB特征。

Result: 在三个主流VAD数据集上达到最优性能，且推理时无需额外模态主干网络。

Conclusion: 多模态增强显著提升了视频异常检测的鲁棒性，PI-VAD为复杂场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are
conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to
limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that
RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such
as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex
real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by
additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced
framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations
by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity
to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity
representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion
(optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an
axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two
plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal
Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation
and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules
operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five
modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing
real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five
modality backbones at inference.

Conclusion: 该研究为实时图像修复提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: One of the major challenges in the field of computer vision especially for
detection, segmentation, recognition, monitoring, and automated solutions, is
the quality of images. Image degradation, often caused by factors such as rain,
fog, lighting, etc., has a negative impact on automated
decision-making.Furthermore, several image restoration solutions exist,
including restoration models for single degradation and restoration models for
multiple degradations. However, these solutions are not suitable for real-time
processing. In this study, the aim was to develop a real-time image restoration
solution for video surveillance. To achieve this, using transfer learning with
ResNet_50, we developed a model for automatically identifying the types of
degradation present in an image to reference the necessary treatment(s) for
image restoration. Our solution has the advantage of being flexible and
scalable.

Motivation: 位置信息在图像分类中具有双重性：既需要平移不变性，又依赖位置偏差（如天空在上）。研究位置偏差对Vision Transformers性能的影响。

Method: 提出Position-SHAP直接测量位置偏差，并开发Auto-PE方法，通过调节位置嵌入的范数自适应学习位置信息。

Result: 不同数据集显示不同程度的位置偏差，Auto-PE能结合现有位置嵌入方法提升分类准确率。

Conclusion: 位置偏差对分类性能至关重要，Auto-PE提供了一种灵活的位置嵌入解决方案。

Abstract: How discriminative position information is for image classification depends
on the data. On the one hand, the camera position is arbitrary and objects can
appear anywhere in the image, arguing for translation invariance. At the same
time, position information is key for exploiting capture/center bias, and scene
layout, e.g.: the sky is up. We show that position bias, the level to which a
dataset is more easily solved when positional information on input features is
used, plays a crucial role in the performance of Vision Transformers image
classifiers. To investigate, we propose Position-SHAP, a direct measure of
position bias by extending SHAP to work with position embeddings. We show
various levels of position bias in different datasets, and find that the
optimal choice of position embedding depends on the position bias apparent in
the dataset. We therefore propose Auto-PE, a single-parameter position
embedding extension, which allows the position embedding to modulate its norm,
enabling the unlearning of position information. Auto-PE combines with existing
PEs to match or improve accuracy on classification datasets.

Conclusion: CacheFlow在速度和精度上均优于现有方法，适用于实时3D人体运动预测。

Abstract: Many density estimation techniques for 3D human motion prediction require a
significant amount of inference time, often exceeding the duration of the
predicted time horizon. To address the need for faster density estimation for
3D human motion prediction, we introduce a novel flow-based method for human
motion prediction called CacheFlow. Unlike previous conditional generative
models that suffer from time efficiency, CacheFlow takes advantage of an
unconditional flow-based generative model that transforms a Gaussian mixture
into the density of future motions. The results of the computation of the
flow-based generative model can be precomputed and cached. Then, for
conditional prediction, we seek a mapping from historical trajectories to
samples in the Gaussian mixture. This mapping can be done by a much more
lightweight model, thus saving significant computation overhead compared to a
typical conditional flow model. In such a two-stage fashion and by caching
results from the slow flow model computation, we build our CacheFlow without
loss of prediction accuracy and model expressiveness. This inference process is
completed in approximately one millisecond, making it 4 times faster than
previous VAE methods and 30 times faster than previous diffusion-based methods
on standard benchmarks such as Human3.6M and AMASS datasets. Furthermore, our
method demonstrates improved density estimation accuracy and comparable
prediction accuracy to a SOTA method on Human3.6M. Our code and models will be
publicly available.

Method: 提出MRAM框架，通过将瞥视位置生成和任务执行功能解耦到两个循环层中，模拟人类视觉处理的神经层次结构。

Result: MRAM不仅表现出更接近人类眼动的注意力动态，还在标准图像分类基准上优于CNN、RAM和DRAM。

Conclusion: MRAM通过层次化建模实现了更平衡的注意力行为，同时提升了性能，为硬注意力模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Inspired by foveal vision, hard attention models promise interpretability and
parameter economy. However, existing models like the Recurrent Model of Visual
Attention (RAM) and Deep Recurrent Attention Model (DRAM) failed to model the
hierarchy of human vision system, that compromise on the visual exploration
dynamics. As a result, they tend to produce attention that are either overly
fixational or excessively saccadic, diverging from human eye movement behavior.
In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Recurrent Attention Model (MRAM), a
novel hard attention framework that explicitly models the neural hierarchy of
human visual processing. By decoupling the function of glimpse location
generation and task execution in two recurrent layers, MRAM emergent a balanced
behavior between fixation and saccadic movement. Our results show that MRAM not
only achieves more human-like attention dynamics, but also consistently
outperforms CNN, RAM and DRAM baselines on standard image classification
benchmarks.

*Qingling Shu,Sibao Chen,Zhihui You,Wei Lu,Jin Tang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了RB-SCD数据集和MFDCD框架，用于精细语义变化检测，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在交通场景中缺乏高质量标注数据，难以提取细粒度语义变化信息。

Method: 引入RB-SCD数据集，提出MFDCD框架，结合多模态频率域特征，包括DFC和TFF模块。

Result: 在RB-SCD和三个公共基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MFDCD框架在道路和桥梁语义变化检测中具有显著效果。

Abstract: Accurate detection of changes in roads and bridges, such as construction,
renovation, and demolition, is essential for urban planning and traffic
management. However, existing methods often struggle to extract fine-grained
semantic change information due to the lack of high-quality annotated datasets
in traffic scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Road and Bridge
Semantic Change Detection (RB-SCD) dataset, a comprehensive benchmark
comprising 260 pairs of high-resolution remote sensing images from diverse
cities and countries. RB-SCD captures 11 types of semantic changes across
varied road and bridge structures, enabling detailed structural and functional
analysis. Building on this dataset, we propose a novel framework, Multimodal
Frequency-Driven Change Detector (MFDCD), which integrates multimodal features
in the frequency domain. MFDCD includes a Dynamic Frequency Coupler (DFC) that
fuses hierarchical visual features with wavelet-based frequency components, and
a Textual Frequency Filter (TFF) that transforms CLIP-derived textual features
into the frequency domain and applies graph-based filtering. Experimental
results on RB-SCD and three public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach.

*Seungjun Oh,Younggeun Lee,Hyejin Jeon,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种混合3D-4D高斯泼溅方法（3D-4DGS），通过自适应地将静态区域表示为3D高斯，动态区域保留为4D高斯，显著减少计算和内存开销，同时保持或提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D高斯泼溅方法在静态区域冗余分配4D高斯，导致计算和内存开销大，且可能降低图像质量。

Method: 从完全4D高斯表示开始，迭代地将时间不变的高斯转换为3D，动态高斯保留4D表示。

Result: 相比基线4D高斯泼溅方法，训练时间显著缩短，视觉质量保持或提升。

Conclusion: 3D-4DGS是一种高效且高质量的动态3D场景重建方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in dynamic 3D scene reconstruction have shown promising
results, enabling high-fidelity 3D novel view synthesis with improved temporal
consistency. Among these, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has emerged as an
appealing approach due to its ability to model high-fidelity spatial and
temporal variations. However, existing methods suffer from substantial
computational and memory overhead due to the redundant allocation of 4D
Gaussians to static regions, which can also degrade image quality. In this
work, we introduce hybrid 3D-4D Gaussian Splatting (3D-4DGS), a novel framework
that adaptively represents static regions with 3D Gaussians while reserving 4D
Gaussians for dynamic elements. Our method begins with a fully 4D Gaussian
representation and iteratively converts temporally invariant Gaussians into 3D,
significantly reducing the number of parameters and improving computational
efficiency. Meanwhile, dynamic Gaussians retain their full 4D representation,
capturing complex motions with high fidelity. Our approach achieves
significantly faster training times compared to baseline 4D Gaussian Splatting
methods while maintaining or improving the visual quality.

*Jiafu Wu,Yabiao Wang,Jian Li,Jinlong Peng,Yun Cao,Chengjie Wang,Jiangning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为PSWA的注意力机制和PCCA策略，显著降低了DiTs的全局计算冗余，并通过Swin-DiT模型在图像生成任务中实现了更高的性能和更低的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DiTs在处理高分辨率图像时计算成本高，且全局信息建模存在冗余。研究发现图像生成对全局信息的依赖并不强，因此需要优化注意力机制以减少冗余。

Method: 提出PSWA（伪移位窗口注意力）和PCCA（渐进覆盖通道分配）策略。PSWA通过窗口注意力实现局部-全局信息交互，并引入高频分支模拟移位窗口操作；PCCA则高效捕获高阶注意力相似性。

Result: 提出的Swin-DiT-L模型在FID指标上比DiT-XL/2提升了54%，同时计算成本更低。

Conclusion: PSWA和PCCA策略有效解决了DiTs的全局计算冗余问题，Swin-DiT在性能和效率上均优于传统DiTs。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve remarkable performance within the
domain of image generation through the incorporation of the transformer
architecture. Conventionally, DiTs are constructed by stacking serial isotropic
global information modeling transformers, which face significant computational
cost when processing high-resolution images. We empirically analyze that latent
space image generation does not exhibit a strong dependence on global
information as traditionally assumed. Most of the layers in the model
demonstrate redundancy in global computation. In addition, conventional
attention mechanisms exhibit low-frequency inertia issues. To address these
issues, we propose \textbf{P}seudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{W}indow
\textbf{A}ttention (PSWA), which fundamentally mitigates global model
redundancy. PSWA achieves intermediate global-local information interaction
through window attention, while employing a high-frequency bridging branch to
simulate shifted window operations, supplementing appropriate global and
high-frequency information. Furthermore, we propose the Progressive Coverage
Channel Allocation(PCCA) strategy that captures high-order attention similarity
without additional computational cost. Building upon all of them, we propose a
series of Pseudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{Win}dow DiTs (\textbf{Swin DiT}),
accompanied by extensive experiments demonstrating their superior performance.
For example, our proposed Swin-DiT-L achieves a 54%$\uparrow$ FID improvement
over DiT-XL/2 while requiring less computational.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为ACSP的全自动剪枝方法，结合结构化剪枝和基于激活的剪枝，高效移除冗余组件并保留关键部分，适用于监督学习任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法需要手动定义剪枝量，效率低且不灵活。ACSP旨在实现全自动化，减少冗余并保持网络性能。

Method: 通过构建图空间编码组件的分离能力，利用互补选择原则和聚类算法，自动确定最优组件子集。

Result: 在多种架构和数据集上验证，ACSP在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: ACSP是一种高效、全自动的剪枝方法，适用于实际部署，无需人工干预。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Automatic Complementary Separation Pruning (ACSP),
a novel and fully automated pruning method for convolutional neural networks.
ACSP integrates the strengths of both structured pruning and activation-based
pruning, enabling the efficient removal of entire components such as neurons
and channels while leveraging activations to identify and retain the most
relevant components. Our approach is designed specifically for supervised
learning tasks, where we construct a graph space that encodes the separation
capabilities of each component with respect to all class pairs. By employing
complementary selection principles and utilizing a clustering algorithm, ACSP
ensures that the selected components maintain diverse and complementary
separation capabilities, reducing redundancy and maintaining high network
performance. The method automatically determines the optimal subset of
components in each layer, utilizing a knee-finding algorithm to select the
minimal subset that preserves performance without requiring user-defined
pruning volumes. Extensive experiments on multiple architectures, including
VGG-16, ResNet-50, and MobileNet-V2, across datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet-1K, demonstrate that ACSP achieves competitive accuracy compared
to other methods while significantly reducing computational costs. This fully
automated approach not only enhances scalability but also makes ACSP especially
practical for real-world deployment by eliminating the need for manually
defining the pruning volume.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于注意力的选择方法（ABS），通过注意力引导的裁剪和特征选择，提升视觉语言模型在零样本任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉增强技术（如随机裁剪）可能引入背景噪声或过度关注局部细节，影响全局语义理解。

Method: 提出ABS方法，结合注意力引导的裁剪和特征选择，补充全局语义信息，并引入软匹配技术优化语言模型描述的对齐。

Result: ABS在分布外泛化和零样本分类任务中达到最优性能，且无需训练，甚至优于少样本和测试时适应方法。

Conclusion: ABS通过注意力机制和特征选择有效解决了视觉增强技术的局限性，显著提升了零样本任务的性能。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), e.g., CLIP, demonstrate impressive
zero-shot capabilities on downstream tasks. Prior research highlights the
crucial role of visual augmentation techniques, like random cropping, in
alignment with fine-grained class descriptions generated by large language
models (LLMs), significantly enhancing zero-shot performance by incorporating
multi-view information. However, the inherent randomness of these augmentations
can inevitably introduce background artifacts and cause models to overly focus
on local details, compromising global semantic understanding. To address these
issues, we propose an \textbf{A}ttention-\textbf{B}ased \textbf{S}election
(\textbf{ABS}) method from local details to global context, which applies
attention-guided cropping in both raw images and feature space, supplement
global semantic information through strategic feature selection. Additionally,
we introduce a soft matching technique to effectively filter LLM descriptions
for better alignment. \textbf{ABS} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
out-of-distribution generalization and zero-shot classification tasks. Notably,
\textbf{ABS} is training-free and even rivals few-shot and test-time adaptation
methods. Our code is available at

TLDR: WriteViT是一个基于Vision Transformers的单样本手写文本合成框架，通过分离内容和风格，在低数据场景下生成高质量的手写文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能快速从单一样本中泛化手写风格，而机器在低数据场景下难以捕捉细微的空间和风格线索，因此提出WriteViT填补这一差距。

Method: WriteViT结合ViT-based Writer Identifier提取风格嵌入，多尺度生成器（Transformer编码器-解码器块+条件位置编码）和轻量级ViT识别器。

Result: 在越南语和英语数据集上，WriteViT生成高质量且风格一致的手写文本，并在低资源场景下保持强识别性能。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的设计在多语言手写生成和高效风格适应中具有潜力。

Abstract: Humans can quickly generalize handwriting styles from a single example by
intuitively separating content from style. Machines, however, struggle with
this task, especially in low-data settings, often missing subtle spatial and
stylistic cues. Motivated by this gap, we introduce WriteViT, a one-shot
handwritten text synthesis framework that incorporates Vision Transformers
(ViT), a family of models that have shown strong performance across various
computer vision tasks. WriteViT integrates a ViT-based Writer Identifier for
extracting style embeddings, a multi-scale generator built with Transformer
encoder-decoder blocks enhanced by conditional positional encoding (CPE), and a
lightweight ViT-based recognizer. While previous methods typically rely on CNNs
or CRNNs, our design leverages transformers in key components to better capture
both fine-grained stroke details and higher-level style information. Although
handwritten text synthesis has been widely explored, its application to
Vietnamese -- a language rich in diacritics and complex typography -- remains
limited. Experiments on Vietnamese and English datasets demonstrate that
WriteViT produces high-quality, style-consistent handwriting while maintaining
strong recognition performance in low-resource scenarios. These results
highlight the promise of transformer-based designs for multilingual handwriting
generation and efficient style adaptation.

Motivation: 现有SP-LiDAR方法通常单独或顺序恢复深度和反射率，且在动态场景中效果有限。

Method: 通过理论分析深度与反射率的相互关联，提出联合估计方法SPLiDER，利用共享信息增强信号恢复。

Result: 在合成和真实SP-LiDAR数据上，SPLiDER表现优于现有方法，实现了更优的联合重建质量。

Conclusion: SPLiDER方法在动态场景中高效且有效，为SP-LiDAR技术提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Single-Photon Light Detection and Ranging (SP-LiDAR is emerging as a leading
technology for long-range, high-precision 3D vision tasks. In SP-LiDAR,
timestamps encode two complementary pieces of information: pulse travel time
(depth) and the number of photons reflected by the object (reflectivity).
Existing SP-LiDAR reconstruction methods typically recover depth and
reflectivity separately or sequentially use one modality to estimate the other.
Moreover, the conventional 3D histogram construction is effective mainly for
slow-moving or stationary scenes. In dynamic scenes, however, it is more
efficient and effective to directly process the timestamps. In this paper, we
introduce an estimation method to simultaneously recover both depth and
reflectivity in fast-moving scenes. We offer two contributions: (1) A
theoretical analysis demonstrating the mutual correlation between depth and
reflectivity and the conditions under which joint estimation becomes
beneficial. (2) A novel reconstruction method, "SPLiDER", which exploits the
shared information to enhance signal recovery. On both synthetic and real
SP-LiDAR data, our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior
joint reconstruction quality.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how explicitly modeling problem's difficulty
prior information shapes the effectiveness of reinforcement learning based
fine-tuning for multimodal reasoning. Our exploration mainly comprises of
following three perspective: First, through offline data curation, we analyze
the U-shaped difficulty distribution of two given datasets using the base model
by multi-round sampling, and then filter out prompts that are either too simple
or extremely difficult to provide meaningful gradients and perform subsequent
two-stage training. Second, we implement an online advantage differentiation,
computing group-wise empirical accuracy as a difficulty proxy to adaptively
reweight advantages estimation, providing stronger learning signals for more
challenging problems. Finally, we introduce difficulty hints as explicit
prompts for more complex samples in the second training stage, encouraging the
model to calibrate its reasoning depth and perform reflective validation
checks. Our comprehensive approach demonstrates significant performances across
various multi-modal mathematical reasoning benchmarks with only 2K+0.6K
two-stage training data.

Motivation: 当前基于BEV的车道检测方法因缺乏深度信息而依赖平坦地面假设，深度估计与车道检测任务融合效果不佳。

Method: 设计了特征提取模块（集成深度网络）、特征降维模块和融合模块，有效结合FV特征与深度信息生成BEV特征。

Result: 在Apollo和OpenLane数据集上表现与最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: 深度感知BEV特征转换方法能有效提升3D车道检测精度，减少对平坦地面假设的依赖。

Abstract: 3D Lane detection plays an important role in autonomous driving. Recent
advances primarily build Birds-Eye-View (BEV) feature from front-view (FV)
images to perceive 3D information of Lane more effectively. However,
constructing accurate BEV information from FV image is limited due to the
lacking of depth information, causing previous works often rely heavily on the
assumption of a flat ground plane. Leveraging monocular depth estimation to
assist in constructing BEV features is less constrained, but existing methods
struggle to effectively integrate the two tasks. To address the above issue, in
this paper, an accurate 3D lane detection method based on depth-aware BEV
feature transtormation is proposed. In detail, an effective feature extraction
module is designed, in which a Depth Net is integrated to obtain the vital
depth information for 3D perception, thereby simplifying the complexity of view
transformation. Subquently a feature reduce module is proposed to reduce height
dimension of FV features and depth features, thereby enables effective fusion
of crucial FV features and depth features. Then a fusion module is designed to
build BEV feature from prime FV feature and depth information. The proposed
method performs comparably with state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic
Apollo, realistic OpenLane datasets.

TLDR: 论文提出EventDC，首个事件驱动的深度补全框架，通过事件调制对齐和局部深度过滤模块，在动态场景中显著提升深度补全质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景中，快速的自运动和物体运动会导致RGB图像和LiDAR测量质量下降，传统RGB-D传感器难以精确对齐和捕获可靠深度。事件相机的高时间分辨率和像素级运动敏感性为此提供了互补信息。

Method: EventDC包含事件调制对齐（EMA）和局部深度过滤（LDF）两个模块，分别通过事件流自适应学习卷积操作的偏移和权重。EMA在编码器中调制RGB-D特征的采样位置，LDF在解码器中通过事件学习运动感知掩码优化深度估计。

Result: 实验表明EventDC在动态场景中表现优越，并建立了首个事件驱动的深度补全基准数据集。

Conclusion: EventDC通过事件驱动的深度补全框架，有效解决了动态场景中的深度补全问题，为未来研究提供了新方向和基准。

Abstract: Depth completion in dynamic scenes poses significant challenges due to rapid
ego-motion and object motion, which can severely degrade the quality of input
modalities such as RGB images and LiDAR measurements. Conventional RGB-D
sensors often struggle to align precisely and capture reliable depth under such
conditions. In contrast, event cameras with their high temporal resolution and
sensitivity to motion at the pixel level provide complementary cues that are
%particularly beneficial in dynamic environments.To this end, we propose
EventDC, the first event-driven depth completion framework. It consists of two
key components: Event-Modulated Alignment (EMA) and Local Depth Filtering
(LDF). Both modules adaptively learn the two fundamental components of
convolution operations: offsets and weights conditioned on motion-sensitive
event streams. In the encoder, EMA leverages events to modulate the sampling
positions of RGB-D features to achieve pixel redistribution for improved
alignment and fusion. In the decoder, LDF refines depth estimations around
moving objects by learning motion-aware masks from events. Additionally,
EventDC incorporates two loss terms to further benefit global alignment and
enhance local depth recovery. Moreover, we establish the first benchmark for
event-based depth completion comprising one real-world and two synthetic
datasets to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments on this benchmark
demonstrate the superiority of our EventDC.

Method: 使用卷积神经网络（CNNs）、Transformer模型和视觉语言模型，在包含43种GT概念的odd-one-out任务中测试其表现。

Result: Transformer模型表现最优，超越儿童水平，且与儿童表现高度一致；视觉语言模型表现较差，偏离人类模式。

Conclusion: 支持学习解释人类GT敏感性的充分性，但多模态整合可能对几何敏感性产生负面影响。

Abstract: With the rapid improvement of machine learning (ML) models, cognitive
scientists are increasingly asking about their alignment with how humans think.
Here, we ask this question for computer vision models and human sensitivity to
geometric and topological (GT) concepts. Under the core knowledge account,
these concepts are innate and supported by dedicated neural circuitry. In this
work, we investigate an alternative explanation, that GT concepts are learned
``for free'' through everyday interaction with the environment. We do so using
computer visions models, which are trained on large image datasets. We build on
prior studies to investigate the overall performance and human alignment of
three classes of models -- convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
transformer-based models, and vision-language models -- on an odd-one-out task
testing 43 GT concepts spanning seven classes. Transformer-based models achieve
the highest overall accuracy, surpassing that of young children. They also show
strong alignment with children's performance, finding the same classes of
concepts easy vs. difficult. By contrast, vision-language models underperform
their vision-only counterparts and deviate further from human profiles,
indicating that na\"ive multimodality might compromise abstract geometric
sensitivity. These findings support the use of computer vision models to
evaluate the sufficiency of the learning account for explaining human
sensitivity to GT concepts, while also suggesting that integrating linguistic
and visual representations might have unpredicted deleterious consequences.

Result: DD-Ranking为不同方法提供了更公平和全面的性能评估标准。

Conclusion: DD-Ranking为数据集蒸馏领域的未来研究提供了更可靠的评价基准。

Abstract: In recent years, dataset distillation has provided a reliable solution for
data compression, where models trained on the resulting smaller synthetic
datasets achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original
datasets. To further improve the performance of synthetic datasets, various
training pipelines and optimization objectives have been proposed, greatly
advancing the field of dataset distillation. Recent decoupled dataset
distillation methods introduce soft labels and stronger data augmentation
during the post-evaluation phase and scale dataset distillation up to larger
datasets (e.g., ImageNet-1K). However, this raises a question: Is accuracy
still a reliable metric to fairly evaluate dataset distillation methods? Our
empirical findings suggest that the performance improvements of these methods
often stem from additional techniques rather than the inherent quality of the
images themselves, with even randomly sampled images achieving superior
results. Such misaligned evaluation settings severely hinder the development of
DD. Therefore, we propose DD-Ranking, a unified evaluation framework, along
with new general evaluation metrics to uncover the true performance
improvements achieved by different methods. By refocusing on the actual
information enhancement of distilled datasets, DD-Ranking provides a more
comprehensive and fair evaluation standard for future research advancements.

Motivation: 传统跨模态检索方法在少样本情况下无法有效建模数据的多峰分布，导致模态内和模态间的偏差，影响检索准确性。

Method: GCRDP结合高斯混合模型（GMM）和多正样本对比学习机制，并引入新的跨模态语义对齐策略。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，GCRDP优于六种现有方法。

Conclusion: GCRDP有效解决了少样本跨模态检索中的偏差问题，显著提升了检索准确性。

Abstract: Few-shot cross-modal retrieval focuses on learning cross-modal
representations with limited training samples, enabling the model to handle
unseen classes during inference. Unlike traditional cross-modal retrieval
tasks, which assume that both training and testing data share the same class
distribution, few-shot retrieval involves data with sparse representations
across modalities. Existing methods often fail to adequately model the
multi-peak distribution of few-shot cross-modal data, resulting in two main
biases in the latent semantic space: intra-modal bias, where sparse samples
fail to capture intra-class diversity, and inter-modal bias, where
misalignments between image and text distributions exacerbate the semantic gap.
These biases hinder retrieval accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a
novel method, GCRDP, for few-shot cross-modal retrieval. This approach
effectively captures the complex multi-peak distribution of data using a
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and incorporates a multi-positive sample
contrastive learning mechanism for comprehensive feature modeling.
Additionally, we introduce a new strategy for cross-modal semantic alignment,
which constrains the relative distances between image and text feature
distributions, thereby improving the accuracy of cross-modal representations.
We validate our approach through extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets, demonstrating superior performance over six state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The combined use of event-based vision and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) is
expected to significantly impact robotics, particularly in tasks like visual
odometry and obstacle avoidance. While existing real-world event-based datasets
for optical flow prediction, typically captured with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs), offer valuable insights, they are limited in diversity, scalability,
and are challenging to collect. Moreover, there is a notable lack of labelled
datasets for underwater applications, which hinders the integration of
event-based vision with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). To address this,
synthetic datasets could provide a scalable solution while bridging the gap
between simulation and reality. In this work, we introduce eStonefish-scenes, a
synthetic event-based optical flow dataset based on the Stonefish simulator.
Along with the dataset, we present a data generation pipeline that enables the
creation of customizable underwater environments. This pipeline allows for

Motivation: 现有技术主要关注高保真重建，需要较多比特，而低比特率点云压缩在带宽受限应用中至关重要。

Method: 采用DDPM架构，结合PointNet编码器生成条件向量，并通过可学习量化器进行量化。

Result: 在ShapeNet和ModelNet40上的实验表明，该方法在低比特率下优于标准化和前沿方法。

Conclusion: DDPM-PCC在低比特率下实现了更好的率失真性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Efficient compression of low-bit-rate point clouds is critical for
bandwidth-constrained applications. However, existing techniques mainly focus
on high-fidelity reconstruction, requiring many bits for compression. This
paper proposes a "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model" (DDPM) architecture
for point cloud compression (DDPM-PCC) at low bit-rates. A PointNet encoder
produces the condition vector for the generation, which is then quantized via a
learnable vector quantizer. This configuration allows to achieve a low bitrates
while preserving quality. Experiments on ShapeNet and ModelNet40 show improved
rate-distortion at low rates compared to standardized and state-of-the-art
approaches. We publicly released the code at
https://github.com/EIDOSLAB/DDPM-PCC.

Conclusion: 首次以自回归方式生成血管，技术具有潜力，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Anatomical trees are critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning,
yet their complex and diverse geometry make accurate representation a
significant challenge. Motivated by the latest advances in large language
models, we introduce an autoregressive method for synthesizing anatomical
trees. Our approach first embeds vessel structures into a learned discrete
vocabulary using a VQ-VAE architecture, then models their generation
autoregressively with a GPT-2 model. This method effectively captures intricate
geometries and branching patterns, enabling realistic vascular tree synthesis.
Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveal that our
technique achieves high-fidelity tree reconstruction with compact discrete
representations. Moreover, our B-spline representation of vessel cross-sections
preserves critical morphological details that are often overlooked in previous'
methods parameterizations. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first
to generate blood vessels in an autoregressive manner. Code, data, and trained
models will be made available.

TLDR: 论文提出UniAttackData+数据集和HiPTune框架，解决现有统一人脸攻击检测模型的不足，通过大规模数据和分层提示调优提升检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型单独训练，无法应对未知攻击且部署负担重，缺乏统一检测模型和可靠分类标准。

Method: 提出UniAttackData+数据集和HiPTune框架，包括视觉提示树和动态提示集成模块。

Result: 在12个数据集上验证了方法的有效性，为UAD领域提供创新方向。

Conclusion: UniAttackData+和HiPTune为统一人脸攻击检测提供了新思路和工具。

Abstract: Presentation Attack Detection and Face Forgery Detection are designed to
protect face data from physical media-based Presentation Attacks and digital
editing-based DeepFakes respectively. But separate training of these two models
makes them vulnerable to unknown attacks and burdens deployment environments.
The lack of a Unified Face Attack Detection model to handle both types of
attacks is mainly due to two factors. First, there's a lack of adequate
benchmarks for models to explore. Existing UAD datasets have limited attack
types and samples, restricting the model's ability to address advanced threats.
To address this, we propose UniAttackDataPlus (UniAttackData+), the most
extensive and sophisticated collection of forgery techniques to date. It
includes 2,875 identities and their 54 kinds of falsified samples, totaling
697,347 videos. Second, there's a lack of a reliable classification criterion.
Current methods try to find an arbitrary criterion within the same semantic
space, which fails when encountering diverse attacks. So, we present a novel
Visual-Language Model-based Hierarchical Prompt Tuning Framework (HiPTune) that
adaptively explores multiple classification criteria from different semantic
spaces. We build a Visual Prompt Tree to explore various classification rules
hierarchically. Then, by adaptively pruning the prompts, the model can select
the most suitable prompts to guide the encoder to extract discriminative
features at different levels in a coarse-to-fine way. Finally, to help the
model understand the classification criteria in visual space, we propose a
Dynamically Prompt Integration module to project the visual prompts to the text
encoder for more accurate semantics. Experiments on 12 datasets have shown the
potential to inspire further innovations in the UAD field.

TLDR: RoPECraft是一种无需训练的视频运动迁移方法，通过修改扩散变换器的旋转位置嵌入（RoPE）实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过直接操作RoPE编码运动信息，简化视频运动迁移过程，避免复杂的训练需求。

Method: 提取参考视频的光流，利用运动偏移扭曲RoPE的复数指数张量，并通过流匹配目标优化轨迹对齐。

Result: 实验表明，RoPECraft在质量和数量上均优于近期发表的其他方法。

Conclusion: RoPECraft通过修改RoPE实现了高效且高质量的视频运动迁移，无需额外训练。

Abstract: We propose RoPECraft, a training-free video motion transfer method for
diffusion transformers that operates solely by modifying their rotary
positional embeddings (RoPE). We first extract dense optical flow from a
reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the
complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the
generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during
denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target
velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the
text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization
term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform,
projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency
artifacts. Experiments on benchmarks reveal that RoPECraft outperforms all
recently published methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出VSA，一种可训练的稀疏注意力机制，通过分阶段处理显著减少计算量，提升视频扩散模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散变换器的3D注意力计算复杂度高，限制了模型扩展。

Method: VSA采用两阶段稀疏注意力：粗阶段池化并识别关键token，细阶段仅计算关键区域的token级注意力。

Result: VSA减少2.53倍训练FLOPS，注意力时间提升6倍，生成时间从31秒降至18秒，质量相当。

Conclusion: VSA为视频扩散模型提供了一种高效的可训练稀疏注意力方案，支持进一步扩展。

Abstract: Scaling video diffusion transformers (DiTs) is limited by their quadratic 3D
attention, even though most of the attention mass concentrates on a small
subset of positions. We turn this observation into VSA, a trainable,
hardware-efficient sparse attention that replaces full attention at \emph{both}
training and inference. In VSA, a lightweight coarse stage pools tokens into
tiles and identifies high-weight \emph{critical tokens}; a fine stage computes
token-level attention only inside those tiles subjecting to block computing
layout to ensure hard efficiency. This leads to a single differentiable kernel
that trains end-to-end, requires no post-hoc profiling, and sustains 85\% of
FlashAttention3 MFU. We perform a large sweep of ablation studies and
scaling-law experiments by pretraining DiTs from 60M to 1.4B parameters. VSA
reaches a Pareto point that cuts training FLOPS by 2.53$\times$ with no drop in
diffusion loss. Retrofitting the open-source Wan-2.1 model speeds up attention
time by 6$\times$ and lowers end-to-end generation time from 31s to 18s with
comparable quality. These results establish trainable sparse attention as a
practical alternative to full attention and a key enabler for further scaling
of video diffusion models.

Result: FEALLM在FEABench上表现优异，并在RAF-DB、AffectNet等数据集上展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: FEALLM和FEABench为面部情感分析任务提供了更高效和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) plays a crucial role in visual affective
computing, aiming to infer a person's emotional state based on facial data.
Scientifically, facial expressions (FEs) result from the coordinated movement
of facial muscles, which can be decomposed into specific action units (AUs)
that provide detailed emotional insights. However, traditional methods often
struggle with limited interpretability, constrained generalization and
reasoning abilities. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
shown exceptional performance in various visual tasks, while they still face
significant challenges in FEA due to the lack of specialized datasets and their
inability to capture the intricate relationships between FEs and AUs. To
address these issues, we introduce a novel FEA Instruction Dataset that
provides accurate and aligned FE and AU descriptions and establishes causal
reasoning relationships between them, followed by constructing a new benchmark,
FEABench. Moreover, we propose FEALLM, a novel MLLM architecture designed to
capture more detailed facial information, enhancing its capability in FEA
tasks. Our model demonstrates strong performance on FEABench and impressive
generalization capability through zero-shot evaluation on various datasets,
including RAF-DB, AffectNet, BP4D, and DISFA, showcasing its robustness and
effectiveness in FEA tasks. The dataset and code will be available at

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in many direct multimodal tasks but
struggle to translate this prowess into effective decision-making within
interactive, visually rich environments like games. This ``knowing-doing'' gap
significantly limits their potential as autonomous agents, as leading VLMs
often performing badly in simple games. To address this, we introduce VLM-Gym,
a curated reinforcement learning (RL) environment featuring diverse visual
games with unified interfaces and adjustable, compositional difficulty,
specifically designed for scalable multi-game parallel training. Leveraging
VLM-Gym, we train G0 models using pure RL-driven self-evolution, which
demonstrate emergent perception and reasoning patterns. To further mitigate
challenges arising from game diversity, we develop G1 models. G1 incorporates a
perception-enhanced cold start prior to RL fine-tuning. Our resulting G1 models
consistently surpass their teacher across all games and outperform leading
proprietary models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking. Systematic analysis reveals
an intriguing finding: perception and reasoning abilities mutually bootstrap
each other throughout the RL training process. Source code including VLM-Gym
and RL training are released at https://github.com/chenllliang/G1 to foster
future research in advancing VLMs as capable interactive agents.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach to analyzing query complexity in Video
Question Answering (VideoQA). Previous efforts in benchmark design have relied
on human expertise to design challenging questions, yet we experimentally show
that humans struggle to predict which questions are difficult for machine
learning models. Our automatic approach leverages recent advances in code
generation for visual question answering, using the complexity of generated
code as a proxy for question difficulty. We demonstrate that this measure
correlates significantly better with model performance than human estimates. To
operationalize this insight, we propose an algorithm for estimating question
complexity from code. It identifies fine-grained primitives that correlate with
the hardest questions for any given set of models, making it easy to scale to
new approaches in the future. Finally, to further illustrate the utility of our
method, we extend it to automatically generate complex questions, constructing
a new benchmark that is 1.9 times harder than the popular NExT-QA.

Abstract: Broader access to high-quality movement analysis could greatly benefit
movement science and rehabilitation, such as allowing more detailed
characterization of movement impairments and responses to interventions, or
even enabling early detection of new neurological conditions or fall risk.
While emerging technologies are making it easier to capture kinematics with
biomechanical models, or how joint angles change over time, inferring the
underlying physics that give rise to these movements, including ground reaction
forces, joint torques, or even muscle activations, is still challenging. Here
we explore whether imitation learning applied to a biomechanical model from a
large dataset of movements from able-bodied and impaired individuals can learn
to compute these inverse dynamics. Although imitation learning in human pose
estimation has seen great interest in recent years, our work differences in
several ways: we focus on using an accurate biomechanical model instead of
models adopted for computer vision, we test it on a dataset that contains
participants with impaired movements, we reported detailed tracking metrics
relevant for the clinical measurement of movement including joint angles and
ground contact events, and finally we apply imitation learning to a
muscle-driven neuromusculoskeletal model. We show that our imitation learning
policy, KinTwin, can accurately replicate the kinematics of a wide range of
movements, including those with assistive devices or therapist assistance, and
that it can infer clinically meaningful differences in joint torques and muscle
activations. Our work demonstrates the potential for using imitation learning
to enable high-quality movement analysis in clinical practice.

Motivation: 当前视频生成方法在建模细粒度语义和复杂时间动态时表现不佳，尤其是生成如体操动作等高难度动作时效果不理想。

Method: FinePhys通过在线估计2D姿态，利用上下文学习进行2D到3D的维度提升，并引入基于物理的运动重估计模块（基于欧拉-拉格朗日方程）来优化3D姿态。

Conclusion: FinePhys通过结合数据驱动和物理学方法，有效解决了细粒度人体动作生成的挑战。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video generation, synthesizing physically
plausible human actions remains a persistent challenge, particularly in
modeling fine-grained semantics and complex temporal dynamics. For instance,
generating gymnastics routines such as "switch leap with 0.5 turn" poses
substantial difficulties for current methods, often yielding unsatisfactory
results. To bridge this gap, we propose FinePhys, a Fine-grained human action
generation framework that incorporates Physics to obtain effective skeletal
guidance. Specifically, FinePhys first estimates 2D poses in an online manner
and then performs 2D-to-3D dimension lifting via in-context learning. To
mitigate the instability and limited interpretability of purely data-driven 3D
poses, we further introduce a physics-based motion re-estimation module
governed by Euler-Lagrange equations, calculating joint accelerations via
bidirectional temporal updating. The physically predicted 3D poses are then
fused with data-driven ones, offering multi-scale 2D heatmap guidance for the
diffusion process. Evaluated on three fine-grained action subsets from FineGym
(FX-JUMP, FX-TURN, and FX-SALTO), FinePhys significantly outperforms
competitive baselines. Comprehensive qualitative results further demonstrate
FinePhys's ability to generate more natural and plausible fine-grained human
actions.

Motivation: 当前离散VT在图像重建和细节保留方面表现不佳，缺乏专门的评估基准，因此需要系统评估VT性能。

Method: 引入VTBench，通过图像重建、细节保留和文本保留三个任务评估VT，并使用多种指标衡量重建质量。

Result: 连续VAE在视觉表示上优于离散VT，离散VT易导致重建失真和细节丢失。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发更强的开源VT，并公开了基准和代码以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have recently shown strong performance in image
generation, where a critical component is the visual tokenizer (VT) that maps
continuous pixel inputs to discrete token sequences. The quality of the VT
largely defines the upper bound of AR model performance. However, current
discrete VTs fall significantly behind continuous variational autoencoders
(VAEs), leading to degraded image reconstructions and poor preservation of
details and text. Existing benchmarks focus on end-to-end generation quality,
without isolating VT performance. To address this gap, we introduce VTBench, a
comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates VTs across three core
tasks: Image Reconstruction, Detail Preservation, and Text Preservation, and
covers a diverse range of evaluation scenarios. We systematically assess
state-of-the-art VTs using a set of metrics to evaluate the quality of
reconstructed images. Our findings reveal that continuous VAEs produce superior
visual representations compared to discrete VTs, particularly in retaining
spatial structure and semantic detail. In contrast, the degraded
representations produced by discrete VTs often lead to distorted
reconstructions, loss of fine-grained textures, and failures in preserving text
and object integrity. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on GPT-4o image
generation and discuss its potential AR nature, offering new insights into the
role of visual tokenization. We release our benchmark and codebase publicly to
support further research and call on the community to develop strong,
general-purpose open-source VTs.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖标定相机或几何先验，限制了在大规模无标定数据上的应用。本文旨在通过自监督训练解决这一问题。

Method: 两阶段策略：1) 隐式学习场景和相机潜在特征；2) 显式预测3D高斯基元，结合渲染和深度投影损失优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无标定数据上实现了高质量视图合成和准确的相机姿态估计，优于依赖标定或深度信息的方法。

Conclusion: 两阶段策略互补且有效，为无标定数据上的视图合成和重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Currently almost all state-of-the-art novel view synthesis and reconstruction
models rely on calibrated cameras or additional geometric priors for training.
These prerequisites significantly limit their applicability to massive
uncalibrated data. To alleviate this requirement and unlock the potential for
self-supervised training on large-scale uncalibrated videos, we propose a novel
two-stage strategy to train a view synthesis model from only raw video frames
or multi-view images, without providing camera parameters or other priors. In
the first stage, we learn to reconstruct the scene implicitly in a latent space
without relying on any explicit 3D representation. Specifically, we predict
per-frame latent camera and scene context features, and employ a view synthesis
model as a proxy for explicit rendering. This pretraining stage substantially
reduces the optimization complexity and encourages the network to learn the
underlying 3D consistency in a self-supervised manner. The learned latent
camera and implicit scene representation have a large gap compared with the
real 3D world. To reduce this gap, we introduce the second stage training by
explicitly predicting 3D Gaussian primitives. We additionally apply explicit
Gaussian Splatting rendering loss and depth projection loss to align the
learned latent representations with physically grounded 3D geometry. In this
way, Stage 1 provides a strong initialization and Stage 2 enforces 3D
consistency - the two stages are complementary and mutually beneficial.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
high-quality novel view synthesis and accurate camera pose estimation, compared
to methods that employ supervision with calibration, pose, or depth
information. The code is available at https://github.com/Dwawayu/Pensieve.

Conclusion: 研究为设计师提供了实用指导，并公开数据集以支持可重复性，推动了以人为中心的3D形状美学研究。

Abstract: Human aesthetic preferences for 3D shapes are central to industrial design,
virtual reality, and consumer product development. However, most computational
models of 3D aesthetics lack empirical grounding in large-scale human
judgments, limiting their practical relevance. We present a large-scale study
of human preferences. We collected 22,301 pairwise comparisons across five
object categories (chairs, tables, mugs, lamps, and dining chairs) via Amazon
Mechanical Turk. Building on a previously published
dataset~\cite{dev2020learning}, we introduce new non-linear modeling and
cross-category analysis to uncover the geometric drivers of aesthetic
preference. We apply the Bradley-Terry model to infer latent aesthetic scores
and use Random Forests with SHAP analysis to identify and interpret the most
influential geometric features (e.g., symmetry, curvature, compactness). Our
cross-category analysis reveals both universal principles and domain-specific
trends in aesthetic preferences. We focus on human interpretable geometric
features to ensure model transparency and actionable design insights, rather
than relying on black-box deep learning approaches. Our findings bridge
computational aesthetics and cognitive science, providing practical guidance
for designers and a publicly available dataset to support reproducibility. This
work advances the understanding of 3D shape aesthetics through a human-centric,

Method: 提出UniHM框架，包括混合运动表示、LFQ-VAE和增强的Lingo数据集。

Result: 在OMOMO和HumanML3D基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: UniHM在复杂3D场景中实现了高效的运动合成。

Abstract: Human motion synthesis in complex scenes presents a fundamental challenge,
extending beyond conventional Text-to-Motion tasks by requiring the integration
of diverse modalities such as static environments, movable objects, natural
language prompts, and spatial waypoints. Existing language-conditioned motion
models often struggle with scene-aware motion generation due to limitations in
motion tokenization, which leads to information loss and fails to capture the
continuous, context-dependent nature of 3D human movement. To address these
issues, we propose UniHM, a unified motion language model that leverages
diffusion-based generation for synthesizing scene-aware human motion. UniHM is
the first framework to support both Text-to-Motion and Text-to-Human-Object
Interaction (HOI) in complex 3D scenes. Our approach introduces three key
contributions: (1) a mixed-motion representation that fuses continuous 6DoF
motion with discrete local motion tokens to improve motion realism; (2) a novel
Look-Up-Free Quantization VAE (LFQ-VAE) that surpasses traditional VQ-VAEs in
both reconstruction accuracy and generative performance; and (3) an enriched
version of the Lingo dataset augmented with HumanML3D annotations, providing
stronger supervision for scene-specific motion learning. Experimental results
demonstrate that UniHM achieves comparative performance on the OMOMO benchmark
for text-to-HOI synthesis and yields competitive results on HumanML3D for
general text-conditioned motion generation.

Method: 提出AdaToken-3D框架，通过空间贡献分析和注意力模式挖掘动态剪枝冗余令牌。

Result: 在LLaVA-3D上实现21%推理速度提升和63%FLOPs减少，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: 揭示了多模态空间信息流中的冗余模式，为高效3D多模态学习奠定理论基础。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have become a pivotal research focus in deep
learning, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in 3D scene understanding.
However, current 3D LMMs employing thousands of spatial tokens for multimodal
reasoning suffer from critical inefficiencies: excessive computational overhead
and redundant information flows. Unlike 2D VLMs processing single images, 3D
LMMs exhibit inherent architectural redundancy due to the heterogeneous
mechanisms between spatial tokens and visual tokens. To address this challenge,
we propose AdaToken-3D, an adaptive spatial token optimization framework that
dynamically prunes redundant tokens through spatial contribution analysis. Our
method automatically tailors pruning strategies to different 3D LMM
architectures by quantifying token-level information flows via attention
pattern mining. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-3D (a 7B parameter 3D-LMM)
demonstrate that AdaToken-3D achieves 21\% faster inference speed and 63\%
FLOPs reduction while maintaining original task accuracy. Beyond efficiency
gains, this work systematically investigates redundancy patterns in multimodal
spatial information flows through quantitative token interaction analysis. Our
findings reveal that over 60\% of spatial tokens contribute minimally ($<$5\%)
to the final predictions, establishing theoretical foundations for efficient 3D
multimodal learning.

### [396] [Bridging Human Oversight and Black-box Driver Assistance: Vision-Language Models for Predictive Alerting in Lane Keeping Assist Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11535)
*Yuhang Wang,Hao Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TLDR: LKAlert是一种新型监督警报系统，利用VLM提前1-3秒预测LKA风险，通过多模态数据和可解释模型增强驾驶员信任和情境意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LKA系统因黑盒特性导致的不可预测故障和驾驶员信任不足的问题。

Method: 结合VLM、CAN数据和可解释模型特征，生成预测警报和自然语言解释。

Result: 预测准确率69.8%，F1分数58.6%，解释质量高（71.7 ROUGE-L），实时性2 Hz。

Conclusion: LKAlert提升了ADAS的安全性和可用性，为黑盒自动化的人机监督提供了可扩展范例。

Abstract: Lane Keeping Assist systems, while increasingly prevalent, often suffer from
unpredictable real-world failures, largely due to their opaque, black-box
nature, which limits driver anticipation and trust. To bridge the gap between
automated assistance and effective human oversight, we present LKAlert, a novel
supervisory alert system that leverages VLM to forecast potential LKA risk 1-3
seconds in advance. LKAlert processes dash-cam video and CAN data, integrating
surrogate lane segmentation features from a parallel interpretable model as
automated guiding attention. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, LKAlert
issues both predictive alert and concise natural language explanation,
enhancing driver situational awareness and trust. To support the development
and evaluation of such systems, we introduce OpenLKA-Alert, the first benchmark
dataset designed for predictive and explainable LKA failure warnings. It
contains synchronized multimodal inputs and human-authored justifications
across annotated temporal windows. We further contribute a generalizable
methodological framework for VLM-based black-box behavior prediction, combining
surrogate feature guidance with LoRA. This framework enables VLM to reason over
structured visual context without altering its vision backbone, making it
broadly applicable to other complex, opaque systems requiring interpretable
oversight. Empirical results correctly predicts upcoming LKA failures with
69.8% accuracy and a 58.6\% F1-score. The system also generates high-quality
textual explanations for drivers (71.7 ROUGE-L) and operates efficiently at
approximately 2 Hz, confirming its suitability for real-time, in-vehicle use.
Our findings establish LKAlert as a practical solution for enhancing the safety
and usability of current ADAS and offer a scalable paradigm for applying VLMs
to human-centered supervision of black-box automation.

TLDR: 论文提出HOVA-500K数据集和GLOVER++框架，用于从人类演示视频中学习可操作的功能性知识，并实现跨场景和任务的鲁棒迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决功能性知识迁移中的两大挑战：缺乏大规模精确标注的数据集和对多样化操作场景中功能性知识的探索不足。

Method: 引入HOVA-500K数据集（50万张图像，1726个对象类别，675种动作）和GLOVER++框架，通过全局到局部的方法训练功能性知识。

Result: GLOVER++在HOVA-500K基准测试中达到最优性能，并在多样化机器人操作任务中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: HOVA-500K和GLOVER++为连接人类演示与机器人操作能力提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos offers a
promising path toward generalizable and interpretable robotic
intelligence-particularly through the lens of actionable affordances. However,
transferring such knowledge remains challenging due to: 1) a lack of
large-scale datasets with precise affordance annotations, and 2) insufficient
exploration of affordances in diverse manipulation contexts. To address these
gaps, we introduce HOVA-500K, a large-scale, affordance-annotated dataset
comprising 500,000 images across 1,726 object categories and 675 actions. We
also release a standardized benchmarking suite for multi-modal affordance
reasoning. Built upon HOVA-500K, we present GLOVER++, a global-to-local
affordance training framework that effectively transfers actionable affordance
knowledge from human demonstrations to downstream open-vocabulary reasoning
tasks. GLOVER++ achieves state-of-the-art results on the HOVA-500K benchmark
and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse downstream robotic
manipulation tasks. By explicitly modeling actionable affordances, GLOVER++
facilitates robust transfer across scenes, modalities, and tasks. We hope that
HOVA-500K and the GLOVER++ framework will serve as valuable resources for
bridging the gap between human demonstrations and robotic manipulation
capabilities.

Conclusion: 该研究为包装自动化提供了创新解决方案，显著提升了机器人系统的实用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a pioneering experimental study on the automated
packing of a catering package using a two-fingered gripper affixed to a
3-degree-of-freedom Delta parallel robot. A distinctive contribution lies in
the application of a deep learning approach to tackle this challenge. A custom
dataset, comprising 1,500 images, is meticulously curated for this endeavor,
representing a noteworthy initiative as the first dataset focusing on
Persian-manufactured products. The study employs the YOLOV5 model for object
detection, followed by segmentation using the FastSAM model. Subsequently,
rotation angle calculation is facilitated with segmentation masks, and a
rotated rectangle encapsulating the object is generated. This rectangle forms
the basis for calculating two grasp points using a novel geometrical approach
involving eigenvectors. An extensive experimental study validates the proposed
model, where all pertinent information is seamlessly transmitted to the 3-DOF
Delta parallel robot. The proposed algorithm ensures real-time detection,
calibration, and the fully autonomous packing process of a catering package,
boasting an impressive over 80\% success rate in automatic grasping. This study
marks a significant stride in advancing the capabilities of robotic systems for
practical applications in packaging automation.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉感知的灵巧全身控制框架（PDC），通过强化学习实现多任务家庭操作，无需特权状态信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类行为依赖视觉感知，受此启发，研究旨在开发一种仅依赖视觉输入的灵巧控制框架，模拟人类行为。

Method: 提出PDC框架，仅使用自我中心视觉输入，通过强化学习训练单一策略完成多任务（如抓取、放置等）。

Result: PDC能实现多任务操作，并涌现出主动搜索等行为，验证了视觉驱动控制的潜力。

Conclusion: 视觉驱动控制是实现感知-动作闭环的关键，适用于动画、机器人和具身AI。

Abstract: Human behavior is fundamentally shaped by visual perception -- our ability to
interact with the world depends on actively gathering relevant information and
adapting our movements accordingly. Behaviors like searching for objects,
reaching, and hand-eye coordination naturally emerge from the structure of our
sensory system. Inspired by these principles, we introduce Perceptive Dexterous
Control (PDC), a framework for vision-driven dexterous whole-body control with
simulated humanoids. PDC operates solely on egocentric vision for task
specification, enabling object search, target placement, and skill selection
through visual cues, without relying on privileged state information (e.g., 3D
object positions and geometries). This perception-as-interface paradigm enables
learning a single policy to perform multiple household tasks, including
reaching, grasping, placing, and articulated object manipulation. We also show
that training from scratch with reinforcement learning can produce emergent
behaviors such as active search. These results demonstrate how vision-driven
control and complex tasks induce human-like behaviors and can serve as the key
ingredients in closing the perception-action loop for animation, robotics, and
embodied AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉惯性里程计（VIO）中，定位与建图模块紧密耦合，导致效率受限。本文旨在探索一种无需地图的高效定位方案。

Method: 移除了传统VIO框架中的视觉地图模块，提出了一种无结构的VIO方法。

Result: 实验表明，与基于结构的VIO基线相比，无结构VIO在计算效率和精度上均有显著优势。

Conclusion: 无结构VIO是一种高效且精确的定位解决方案，突破了传统VIO的耦合限制。

Abstract: Visual odometry (VO) is typically considered as a chicken-and-egg problem, as
the localization and mapping modules are tightly-coupled. The estimation of
visual map relies on accurate localization information. Meanwhile, localization
requires precise map points to provide motion constraints. This classical
design principle is naturally inherited by visual-inertial odometry (VIO).
Efficient localization solution that does not require a map has not been fully
investigated. To this end, we propose a novel structureless VIO, where the
visual map is removed from the odometry framework. Experimental results
demonstrated that, compared to the structure-based VIO baseline, our
structureless VIO not only substantially improves computational efficiency but
also has advantages in accuracy.

Motivation: 目前缺乏统一的基准测试来公平、可重复地比较不同的远程操作系统，因此提出了TeleOpBench。

Method: 设计了30个任务环境，涵盖多种操作难度，并实现了四种远程操作模式（MoCap、VR设备、外骨骼和单目视觉跟踪），通过共同协议和指标进行评估。

Result: 在模拟器和物理硬件上的实验表现高度相关，验证了TeleOpBench的外部有效性。

Conclusion: TeleOpBench为远程操作研究提供了统一的衡量标准，并为未来的算法和硬件创新提供了可扩展平台。

Abstract: Teleoperation is a cornerstone of embodied-robot learning, and bimanual
dexterous teleoperation in particular provides rich demonstrations that are
difficult to obtain with fully autonomous systems. While recent studies have
proposed diverse hardware pipelines-ranging from inertial motion-capture gloves
to exoskeletons and vision-based interfaces-there is still no unified benchmark
that enables fair, reproducible comparison of these systems. In this paper, we
introduce TeleOpBench, a simulator-centric benchmark tailored to bimanual
dexterous teleoperation. TeleOpBench contains 30 high-fidelity task
environments that span pick-and-place, tool use, and collaborative
manipulation, covering a broad spectrum of kinematic and force-interaction
difficulty. Within this benchmark we implement four representative
teleoperation modalities-(i) MoCap, (ii) VR device, (iii) arm-hand
exoskeletons, and (iv) monocular vision tracking-and evaluate them with a
common protocol and metric suite. To validate that performance in simulation is
predictive of real-world behavior, we conduct mirrored experiments on a
physical dual-arm platform equipped with two 6-DoF dexterous hands. Across 10
held-out tasks we observe a strong correlation between simulator and hardware
performance, confirming the external validity of TeleOpBench. TeleOpBench
establishes a common yardstick for teleoperation research and provides an
extensible platform for future algorithmic and hardware innovation.

Result: IG Parser能够高效地编码和转换规则与策略，支持多样化的分析方法。

Conclusion: IG Parser是一个强大的工具，适用于制度分析，其语法和架构设计为研究提供了便利。

Abstract: This article provides an overview of IG Parser, a software that facilitates
qualitative content analysis of formal (e.g., legal) rules or informal (e.g.,
socio-normative) norms, and strategies (such as conventions) -- referred to as
\emph{institutions} -- that govern social systems and operate configurally to
describe \emph{institutional systems}. To this end, the IG Parser employs a
distinctive syntax that ensures rigorous encoding of natural language, while
automating the transformation into various formats that support the downstream
analysis using diverse analytical techniques. The conceptual core of the IG
Parser is an associated syntax, IG Script, that operationalizes the conceptual
foundations of the Institutional Grammar, and more specifically Institutional
Grammar 2.0, an analytical paradigm for institutional analysis. This article
presents the IG Parser, including its conceptual foundations, syntactic
specification of IG Script, alongside architectural principles. This

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在应对现代软件系统的规模和复杂性时表现不足，特别是在设计模式检测和代码重构方面，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出了ASE范式，并通过BSS（语言无关的代码表示）和ODR（优化代码重构的启发式算法）两个框架进行验证。

Result: BSS实现了精确的设计模式检测，ODR通过统一表示优化了代码重构，减少了计算开销。

Conclusion: ASE为复杂软件问题的建模和解决提供了结构化方法，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: As modern software systems expand in scale and complexity, the challenges
associated with their modeling and formulation grow increasingly intricate.
Traditional approaches often fall short in effectively addressing these
complexities, particularly in tasks such as design pattern detection for
maintenance and assessment, as well as code refactoring for optimization and
long-term sustainability. This growing inadequacy underscores the need for a
paradigm shift in how such challenges are approached and resolved. This paper
presents Analytical Software Engineering (ASE), a novel design paradigm aimed
at balancing abstraction, tool accessibility, compatibility, and scalability.
ASE enables effective modeling and resolution of complex software engineering
problems. The paradigm is evaluated through two frameworks
Behavioral-Structural Sequences (BSS) and Optimized Design Refactoring (ODR),
both developed in accordance with ASE principles. BSS offers a compact,
language-agnostic representation of codebases to facilitate precise design
pattern detection. ODR unifies artifact and solution representations to
optimize code refactoring via heuristic algorithms while eliminating iterative
computational overhead. By providing a structured approach to software design
challenges, ASE lays the groundwork for future research in encoding and
analyzing complex software metrics.

TLDR: EVALOOP是一个新的评估框架，通过自一致性循环评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在编程任务中的鲁棒性，发现模型鲁棒性与初始性能并不总是一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法主要关注静态基准测试的代码生成准确性，忽略了模型在编程任务中的鲁棒性，且现有对抗攻击方法效果有限且不一致。

Method: EVALOOP通过自反馈循环（如代码生成与代码摘要的循环）评估模型鲁棒性，无需外部攻击设置。

Result: 在16个主流LLMs上测试，EVALOOP通常在10次循环内导致pass@1性能下降5.01%-19.31%，且鲁棒性与初始性能不一定相关。

Conclusion: EVALOOP提供了一种统一的鲁棒性评估方法，揭示了模型在持续任务中的性能变化，为LLMs的编程能力评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations,
however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static
benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during
programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model
robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained.
Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent
results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We
introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness
from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality
inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code
summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM
generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language
specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new
output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats
the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical
strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack
setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming.
We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found
that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1
performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align
with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo,
despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated
lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.

Abstract: Geospatial code generation is emerging as a key direction in the integration

lack of standardized tools for automatic evaluation in this domain. To address
this gap, we propose AutoGEEval, the first multimodal, unit-level automated

GEE Python API, AutoGEEval establishes a benchmark suite (AutoGEEval-Bench)
comprising 1325 test cases that span 26 GEE data types. The framework
integrates both question generation and answer verification components to
enable an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline-from function invocation to
execution validation. AutoGEEval supports multidimensional quantitative
analysis of model outputs in terms of accuracy, resource consumption, execution
efficiency, and error types. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art LLMs-including
general-purpose, reasoning-augmented, code-centric, and geoscience-specialized
models-revealing their performance characteristics and potential optimization
pathways in GEE code generation. This work provides a unified protocol and
foundational resource for the development and assessment of geospatial code
generation models, advancing the frontier of automated natural language to

Result: 文本语气对预测误差和修订有预测力，且这种关系在语言更模糊、不确定性更高或分析师更忙时更强。

Conclusion: 语言传递了一些模糊但有用的信息，这些信息无法通过数值预测传达。

Abstract: People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for
which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with
differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less
known-role in subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their
reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not
numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has
predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical
forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is
vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our
theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and
only communicated through language.

Motivation: 前列腺癌早期检测需求迫切，但传统超声方法灵敏度低，超声CT在临床应用中面临挑战。

Method: 使用解剖学准确的3D数字前列腺模型生成2D声速幻影和超声全波形数据，采用先进声波求解器模拟。

Result: 深度学习方法在效率和精度上优于传统物理方法，但仍未达到临床高分辨率要求。

Conclusion: 公开OpenPros数据集以促进机器学习算法发展，填补性能差距，实现临床可用高分辨率图像。

Abstract: Prostate cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers among men,
making its early detection critically important. Although ultrasound imaging
offers greater accessibility and cost-effectiveness compared to MRI,
traditional transrectal ultrasound methods suffer from low sensitivity,
especially in detecting anteriorly located tumors. Ultrasound computed
tomography provides quantitative tissue characterization, but its clinical
implementation faces significant challenges, particularly under anatomically
constrained limited-angle acquisition conditions specific to prostate imaging.
To address these unmet needs, we introduce OpenPros, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset explicitly developed for limited-view prostate USCT. Our
dataset includes over 280,000 paired samples of realistic 2D speed-of-sound
(SOS) phantoms and corresponding ultrasound full-waveform data, generated from
anatomically accurate 3D digital prostate models derived from real clinical
MRI/CT scans and ex vivo ultrasound measurements, annotated by medical experts.
Simulations are conducted under clinically realistic configurations using
advanced finite-difference time-domain and Runge-Kutta acoustic wave solvers,
both provided as open-source components. Through comprehensive baseline
experiments, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art deep learning methods surpass
traditional physics-based approaches in both inference efficiency and
reconstruction accuracy. Nevertheless, current deep learning models still fall
short of delivering clinically acceptable high-resolution images with
sufficient accuracy. By publicly releasing OpenPros, we aim to encourage the
development of advanced machine learning algorithms capable of bridging this
performance gap and producing clinically usable, high-resolution, and highly
accurate prostate ultrasound images. The dataset is publicly accessible at
https://open-pros.github.io/.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have become ubiquitous in everyday

demographic groups persist. In this work, we introduce the ASR-FAIRBENCH
leaderboard which is designed to assess both the accuracy and equity of ASR
models in real-time. Leveraging the Meta's Fair-Speech dataset, which captures
diverse demographic characteristics, we employ a mixed-effects Poisson
regression model to derive an overall fairness score. This score is integrated
with traditional metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) to compute the Fairness
Adjusted ASR Score (FAAS), providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. Our
approach reveals significant performance disparities in SOTA ASR models across
demographic groups and offers a benchmark to drive the development of more
inclusive ASR technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语音克隆中表现出色，但也增加了恶意滥用的风险。现有防御方法不适用于扩散模型，因此需要一种新的防御框架。

Method: VoiceCloak通过分析扩散模型的漏洞，引入对抗性扰动干扰克隆过程，包括扭曲说话人身份表示和破坏条件引导过程，同时通过噪声引导的语义破坏降低输出质量。

Result: 实验表明，VoiceCloak在防御未经授权的扩散模型语音克隆方面表现出色。

Conclusion: VoiceCloak为扩散模型提供了一种有效的主动防御方案，保护语音数据免受滥用。

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice
cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing
proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the
forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the
intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of
obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential
unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to
identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt
the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference
audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets
speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize
identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles.
Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes,
particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal
characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to

TLDR: MMAR是一个新的音频-语言模型（ALM）基准测试，用于评估跨多学科任务的深度推理能力，包含1000个高质量音频-问题-答案三元组，覆盖广泛的真实场景和复杂推理层次。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试局限于特定音频领域，缺乏对多模态和深度推理的评估，MMAR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MMAR通过精心筛选和迭代修正构建数据集，问题分为四个推理层次（信号、感知、语义、文化），并附带链式思维（CoT）标注。

Result: 测试显示当前模型在MMAR上表现不佳，揭示其在理解和推理能力上的局限性。

Conclusion: MMAR有望推动音频推理领域的研究，促进模型能力的提升。

Abstract: We introduce MMAR, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the deep reasoning
capabilities of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) across massive multi-disciplinary
tasks. MMAR comprises 1,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer
triplets, collected from real-world internet videos and refined through
iterative error corrections and quality checks to ensure high quality. Unlike
existing benchmarks that are limited to specific domains of sound, music, or
speech, MMAR extends them to a broad spectrum of real-world audio scenarios,
including mixed-modality combinations of sound, music, and speech. Each
question in MMAR is hierarchically categorized across four reasoning layers:
Signal, Perception, Semantic, and Cultural, with additional sub-categories
within each layer to reflect task diversity and complexity. To further foster
research in this area, we annotate every question with a Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
rationale to promote future advancements in audio reasoning. Each item in the
benchmark demands multi-step deep reasoning beyond surface-level understanding.
Moreover, a part of the questions requires graduate-level perceptual and
domain-specific knowledge, elevating the benchmark's difficulty and depth. We
evaluate MMAR using a broad set of models, including Large Audio-Language
Models (LALMs), Large Audio Reasoning Models (LARMs), Omni Language Models
(OLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), with
audio caption inputs. The performance of these models on MMAR highlights the
benchmark's challenging nature, and our analysis further reveals critical
limitations of understanding and reasoning capabilities among current models.
We hope MMAR will serve as a catalyst for future advances in this important but
little-explored area.

TLDR: 提出了一种统一的多模态音乐翻译方法，通过大规模数据集和统一的分词框架，显著提升了跨模态翻译任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去的多模态音乐翻译任务通常针对单一任务训练专用模型，缺乏统一性和效率。本文旨在通过统一的方法解决这一问题。

Method: 使用大规模数据集（1,300小时音频-乐谱图像配对数据）和统一的分词框架，将不同模态离散化为令牌序列，采用单一编码器-解码器Transformer模型处理多任务。

Result: 统一模型在多个任务中表现优于单任务基线，如光学音乐识别的符号错误率从24.58%降至13.67%，并首次实现了乐谱图像条件音频生成。

Conclusion: 统一的多任务方法显著提升了跨模态音乐翻译的性能，为音乐信息检索和生成开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Music exists in various modalities, such as score images, symbolic scores,
MIDI, and audio. Translations between each modality are established as core
tasks of music information retrieval, such as automatic music transcription
(audio-to-MIDI) and optical music recognition (score image to symbolic score).
However, most past work on multimodal translation trains specialized models on
individual translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified approach,
where we train a general-purpose model on many translation tasks
simultaneously. Two key factors make this unified approach viable: a new
large-scale dataset and the tokenization of each modality. Firstly, we propose
a new dataset that consists of more than 1,300 hours of paired audio-score
image data collected from YouTube videos, which is an order of magnitude larger
than any existing music modal translation datasets. Secondly, our unified
tokenization framework discretizes score images, audio, MIDI, and MusicXML into
a sequence of tokens, enabling a single encoder-decoder Transformer to tackle
multiple cross-modal translation as one coherent sequence-to-sequence task.
Experimental results confirm that our unified multitask model improves upon
single-task baselines in several key areas, notably reducing the symbol error
rate for optical music recognition from 24.58% to a state-of-the-art 13.67%,
while similarly substantial improvements are observed across the other
translation tasks. Notably, our approach achieves the first successful
score-image-conditioned audio generation, marking a significant breakthrough in
cross-modal music generation.

*Jiacheng Hou,Zhenjie Song,Ercan Engin Kuruoglu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于纯MLP的方法BrainNetMLP，用于功能脑网络分类，展示了MLP在高效计算和较少参数下的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习模型复杂度增加，但性能提升不明显，因此重新审视最简单的MLP架构。

Method: 提出BrainNetMLP，采用双分支结构融合空间连接和频谱信息。

Result: 在HCP和ABIDE数据集上实现了最先进性能。

Conclusion: MLP模型是功能脑网络分类中高效且有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have made great progress in functional brain network
classification by modeling the brain as a network of Regions of Interest (ROIs)
and leveraging their connections to understand brain functionality and diagnose
mental disorders. Various deep learning architectures, including Convolutional
Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, and the recent Transformer, have been
developed. However, despite the increasing complexity of these models, the
performance gain has not been as salient. This raises a question: Does
increasing model complexity necessarily lead to higher classification accuracy?
In this paper, we revisit the simplest deep learning architecture, the
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and propose a pure MLP-based method, named
BrainNetMLP, for functional brain network classification, which capitalizes on
the advantages of MLP, including efficient computation and fewer parameters.
Moreover, BrainNetMLP incorporates a dual-branch structure to jointly capture
both spatial connectivity and spectral information, enabling precise
spatiotemporal feature fusion. We evaluate our proposed BrainNetMLP on two
public and popular brain network classification datasets, the Human Connectome
Project (HCP) and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Experimental
results demonstrate pure MLP-based methods can achieve state-of-the-art
performance, revealing the potential of MLP-based models as more efficient yet
effective alternatives in functional brain network classification. The code

Motivation: 现有研究对LALMs在语音和音频处理任务中的表现进行了广泛研究，但其多跳推理能力（即整合多个事实的能力）缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 作者提出了SAKURA基准，专门评估LALMs基于语音和音频信息的多跳推理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，LALMs在多跳推理中难以整合语音/音频表征，即使能正确提取相关信息。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LALMs在多模态推理中的根本性挑战，为未来研究提供了资源和方向。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend the large language models with
multimodal understanding in speech, audio, etc. While their performances on
speech and audio-processing tasks are extensively studied, their reasoning
abilities remain underexplored. Particularly, their multi-hop reasoning, the
ability to recall and integrate multiple facts, lacks systematic evaluation.
Existing benchmarks focus on general speech and audio-processing tasks,
conversational abilities, and fairness but overlook this aspect. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SAKURA, a benchmark assessing LALMs' multi-hop reasoning
based on speech and audio information. Results show that LALMs struggle to
integrate speech/audio representations for multi-hop reasoning, even when they
extract the relevant information correctly, highlighting a fundamental
challenge in multimodal reasoning. Our findings expose a critical limitation in
LALMs, offering insights and resources for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN感受野有限和Transformer计算复杂度高的问题，探索Mamba和KAN在医学图像分割中的潜力。

Result: 在五个公开医学图像分割数据集上，MedVKAN在四个数据集上表现最佳，另一个排名第二。

Conclusion: MedVKAN展示了Mamba和KAN在医学图像分割中的潜力，提供了一种创新且高效的特征提取框架。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation relies heavily on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and Transformer-based models. However, CNNs are constrained by limited
receptive fields, while Transformers suffer from scalability challenges due to
their quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, recent
advances have explored alternative architectures. The state-space model Mamba
offers near-linear complexity while capturing long-range dependencies, and the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) enhances nonlinear expressiveness by replacing
fixed activation functions with learnable ones. Building on these strengths, we
propose MedVKAN, an efficient feature extraction model integrating Mamba and
KAN. Specifically, we introduce the EFC-KAN module, which enhances KAN with
convolutional operations to improve local pixel interaction. We further design
the VKAN module, integrating Mamba with EFC-KAN as a replacement for
Transformer modules, significantly improving feature extraction. Extensive
experiments on five public medical image segmentation datasets show that
MedVKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets and ranks second
on the remaining one. These results validate the potential of Mamba and KAN for
medical image segmentation while introducing an innovative and computationally
efficient feature extraction framework. The code is available at:

Motivation: 放疗期间器官运动影响治疗精度，现有方法依赖PCA且难以捕捉周期性动态。

Method: 将器官运动预测建模为自回归过程，利用4D CT扫描数据预测未来运动相位。

Result: 在50名患者和公开数据集上测试，预测性能优于现有基准。

Conclusion: 该方法有望提升放疗前规划精度，实现更精准的放射治疗。

Abstract: Radiotherapy often involves a prolonged treatment period. During this time,
patients may experience organ motion due to breathing and other physiological
factors. Predicting and modeling this motion before treatment is crucial for
ensuring precise radiation delivery. However, existing pre-treatment organ
motion prediction methods primarily rely on deformation analysis using
principal component analysis (PCA), which is highly dependent on registration
quality and struggles to capture periodic temporal dynamics for motion
modeling.In this paper, we observe that organ motion prediction closely
resembles an autoregressive process, a technique widely used in natural
language processing (NLP). Autoregressive models predict the next token based
on previous inputs, naturally aligning with our objective of predicting future
organ motion phases. Building on this insight, we reformulate organ motion
prediction as an autoregressive process to better capture patient-specific
motion patterns. Specifically, we acquire 4D CT scans for each patient before
treatment, with each sequence comprising multiple 3D CT phases. These phases
are fed into the autoregressive model to predict future phases based on prior
phase motion patterns. We evaluate our method on a real-world test set of 4D CT
scans from 50 patients who underwent radiotherapy at our institution and a
public dataset containing 4D CT scans from 20 patients (some with multiple
scans), totaling over 1,300 3D CT phases. The performance in predicting the
motion of the lung and heart surpasses existing benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing motion dynamics from CT images. These results
highlight the potential of our method to improve pre-treatment planning in
radiotherapy, enabling more precise and adaptive radiation delivery.

Motivation: 解决跨模态医学图像分割中的域适应问题，利用跨模态图像共享的低级特征（如边缘）来提升分割效果。

Conclusion: LowBridge简单有效，具有与先进模型结合的潜力，未来可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the task of cross-modal medical image segmentation by
exploring unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches. We propose a
model-agnostic UDA framework, LowBridge, which builds on a simple observation
that cross-modal images share some similar low-level features (e.g., edges) as
they are depicting the same structures. Specifically, we first train a
generative model to recover the source images from their edge features,
followed by training a segmentation model on the generated source images,
separately. At test time, edge features from the target images are input to the
pretrained generative model to generate source-style target domain images,
which are then segmented using the pretrained segmentation network. Despite its
simplicity, extensive experiments on various publicly available datasets
demonstrate that \proposed achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
eleven existing UDA approaches under different settings. Notably, further
ablation studies show that \proposed is agnostic to different types of
generative and segmentation models, suggesting its potential to be seamlessly
plugged with the most advanced models to achieve even more outstanding results
in the future. The code is available at https://github.com/JoshuaLPF/LowBridge.

<details>

Motivation: 动态成像在医学和细胞生物学中至关重要，但时间序列数据和时间点的稀缺性限制了有意义模式的学习。现有方法要么忽略时间先验，要么忽视其他时间序列的信息。

Method: 提出了一种潜在模型表示图像流形，并确保该表示与时间序列数据及OT先验的一致性，从而结合低维假设和OT正则化的优势。

Result: 该方法通过结合低维流形假设和OT先验，提高了动态图像分析的性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将OT插值与潜在模型结合，并将OT先验整合到潜在模型中，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Dynamic imaging is critical for understanding and visualizing dynamic
biological processes in medicine and cell biology. These applications often
encounter the challenge of a limited amount of time series data and time
points, which hinders learning meaningful patterns. Regularization methods
provide valuable prior knowledge to address this challenge, enabling the
extraction of relevant information despite the scarcity of time-series data and
time points. In particular, low-dimensionality assumptions on the image
manifold address sample scarcity, while time progression models, such as
optimal transport (OT), provide priors on image development to mitigate the
lack of time points. Existing approaches using low-dimensionality assumptions
disregard a temporal prior but leverage information from multiple time series.
OT-prior methods, however, incorporate the temporal prior but regularize only
individual time series, ignoring information from other time series of the same
image modality. In this work, we investigate the effect of integrating a
low-dimensionality assumption of the underlying image manifold with an OT
regularizer for time-evolving images. In particular, we propose a latent model
representation of the underlying image manifold and promote consistency between
this representation, the time series data, and the OT prior on the
time-evolving images. We discuss the advantages of enriching OT interpolations
with latent models and integrating OT priors into latent models.

Motivation: 传统视网膜层分割方法耗时且易受人为偏差影响，而现有深度学习方法缺乏不确定性估计，导致模型可能产生错误但自信的预测。

Method: 使用贝叶斯卷积神经网络对公开的OCT数据集（35例人类视网膜图像）进行分割，并生成不确定性图谱。

Result: 模型在分割任务中表现出色（Dice分数95.65%），并能识别高不确定性的样本（如噪声或校准错误）。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了视网膜OCT分割的临床适用性、统计稳健性和性能。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides valuable insights in
ophthalmology, cardiology, and neurology due to high-resolution,
cross-sectional images of the retina. One critical task for ophthalmologists
using OCT is delineation of retinal layers within scans. This process is
time-consuming and prone to human bias, affecting the accuracy and reliability
of diagnoses. Previous efforts to automate delineation using deep learning face
challenges in uptake from clinicians and statisticians due to the absence of
uncertainty estimation, leading to "confidently wrong" models via
hallucinations. In this study, we address these challenges by applying Bayesian
convolutional neural networks (BCNNs) to segment an openly available OCT
imaging dataset containing 35 human retina OCTs split between healthy controls
and patients with multiple sclerosis. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian
models can be used to provide uncertainty maps of the segmentation, which can
further be used to identify highly uncertain samples that exhibit recording
artefacts such as noise or miscalibration at inference time. Our method also
allows for uncertainty-estimation for important secondary measurements such as
layer thicknesses, that are medically relevant for patients. We show that these
features come in addition to greater performance compared to similar work over
all delineations; with an overall Dice score of 95.65%. Our work brings greater
clinical applicability, statistical robustness, and performance to retinal OCT
segmentation.

Motivation: LDCT图像常伴随显著噪声，影响图像质量和诊断准确性。现有方法在多尺度特征融合和噪声分布多样性方面存在挑战。

Method: CTLformer结合卷积结构和Transformer架构，引入多尺度注意力机制和动态注意力控制机制，通过Token2Token机制和自注意力交互模块捕获多尺度特征，并自适应调整注意力分布。

Result: 在2016年NIH AAPM Mayo Clinic LDCT Challenge数据集上，CTLformer在去噪性能和模型效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CTLformer为LDCT去噪提供了高效解决方案，并在处理复杂噪声模式的医学图像分析中展现出广泛潜力。

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) images are often accompanied by significant noise, which
negatively impacts image quality and subsequent diagnostic accuracy. To address
the challenges of multi-scale feature fusion and diverse noise distribution
patterns in LDCT denoising, this paper introduces an innovative model,
CTLformer, which combines convolutional structures with transformer
architecture. Two key innovations are proposed: a multi-scale attention
mechanism and a dynamic attention control mechanism. The multi-scale attention
mechanism, implemented through the Token2Token mechanism and self-attention
interaction modules, effectively captures both fine details and global
structures at different scales, enhancing relevant features and suppressing
noise. The dynamic attention control mechanism adapts the attention
distribution based on the noise characteristics of the input image, focusing on
high-noise regions while preserving details in low-noise areas, thereby
enhancing robustness and improving denoising performance. Furthermore,
CTLformer integrates convolutional layers for efficient feature extraction and
uses overlapping inference to mitigate boundary artifacts, further
strengthening its denoising capability. Experimental results on the 2016
National Institutes of Health AAPM Mayo Clinic LDCT Challenge dataset
demonstrate that CTLformer significantly outperforms existing methods in both
denoising performance and model efficiency, greatly improving the quality of
LDCT images. The proposed CTLformer not only provides an efficient solution for
LDCT denoising but also shows broad potential in medical image analysis,
especially for clinical applications dealing with complex noise patterns.

Conclusion: PRETI通过结合元数据和自监督学习，显著提升了视网膜图像分析的诊断性能。

Abstract: Retinal foundation models have significantly advanced retinal image analysis
by leveraging self-supervised learning to reduce dependence on labeled data
while achieving strong generalization. Many recent approaches enhance retinal
image understanding using report supervision, but obtaining clinical reports is
often costly and challenging. In contrast, metadata (e.g., age, gender) is
widely available and serves as a valuable resource for analyzing disease
progression. To effectively incorporate patient-specific information, we
propose PRETI, a retinal foundation model that integrates metadata-aware
learning with robust self-supervised representation learning. We introduce
Learnable Metadata Embedding (LME), which dynamically refines metadata
representations. Additionally, we construct patient-level data pairs,
associating images from the same individual to improve robustness against
non-clinical variations. To further optimize retinal image representation, we
propose Retina-Aware Adaptive Masking (RAAM), a strategy that selectively
applies masking within the retinal region and dynamically adjusts the masking
ratio during training. PRETI captures both global structures and fine-grained
pathological details, resulting in superior diagnostic performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PRETI achieves state-of-the-art results across
diverse diseases and biomarker predictions using in-house and public data,
indicating the importance of metadata-guided foundation models in retinal
disease analysis. Our code and pretrained model are available at

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised medical segmentation co-learning frameworks have
realized that model performance can be diminished by the biases in model
recognition caused by low-quality pseudo-labels. Due to the averaging nature of
their pseudo-label integration strategy, they fail to explore the reliability
of pseudo-labels from different sources. In this paper, we propose a mutual
evidential deep learning (MEDL) framework that offers a potentially viable
solution for pseudo-label generation in semi-supervised learning from two
perspectives. First, we introduce networks with different architectures to
generate complementary evidence for unlabeled samples and adopt an improved
class-aware evidential fusion to guide the confident synthesis of evidential
predictions sourced from diverse architectural networks. Second, utilizing the
uncertainty in the fused evidence, we design an asymptotic Fisher
information-based evidential learning strategy. This strategy enables the model
to initially focus on unlabeled samples with more reliable pseudo-labels,
gradually shifting attention to samples with lower-quality pseudo-labels while
avoiding over-penalization of mislabeled classes in high data uncertainty
samples. Additionally, for labeled data, we continue to adopt an
uncertainty-driven asymptotic learning strategy, gradually guiding the model to
focus on challenging voxels. Extensive experiments on five mainstream datasets
have demonstrated that MEDL achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: FreqSelect是一种轻量级自适应模块，通过选择性过滤空间频率带提升fMRI数据重建自然图像的效果，无需额外监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI信号噪声多、分辨率低，现有方法对所有空间频率成分一视同仁，限制了模型效果。

Method: 引入FreqSelect模块，动态选择与大脑活动最相关的频率带，抑制无关噪声，无需额外监督。

Result: 在Natural Scenes数据集上，FreqSelect显著提升了重建质量，并提供了频率选择模式的可解释性。

Conclusion: FreqSelect不仅提升了解码精度，还为神经科学解释提供了新视角，适用于多种神经成像模态。

Abstract: Reconstructing natural images from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data remains a core challenge in natural decoding due to the mismatch
between the richness of visual stimuli and the noisy, low resolution nature of
fMRI signals. While recent two-stage models, combining deep variational
autoencoders (VAEs) with diffusion models, have advanced this task, they treat
all spatial-frequency components of the input equally. This uniform treatment
forces the model to extract meaning features and suppress irrelevant noise
simultaneously, limiting its effectiveness. We introduce FreqSelect, a
lightweight, adaptive module that selectively filters spatial-frequency bands
before encoding. By dynamically emphasizing frequencies that are most
predictive of brain activity and suppressing those that are uninformative,
FreqSelect acts as a content-aware gate between image features and natural
data. It integrates seamlessly into standard very deep VAE-diffusion pipelines
and requires no additional supervision. Evaluated on the Natural Scenes
dataset, FreqSelect consistently improves reconstruction quality across both
low- and high-level metrics. Beyond performance gains, the learned
frequency-selection patterns offer interpretable insights into how different
visual frequencies are represented in the brain. Our method generalizes across
subjects and scenes, and holds promise for extension to other neuroimaging
modalities, offering a principled approach to enhancing both decoding accuracy
and neuroscientific interpretability.

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a product-of-experts-type model that
encompasses many standard prior and posterior distributions commonly found in
Bayesian imaging. We show that this model can be easily lifted into a novel
latent variable model, which we refer to as a Gaussian latent machine. This
leads to a general sampling approach that unifies and generalizes many existing
sampling algorithms in the literature. Most notably, it yields a highly
efficient and effective two-block Gibbs sampling approach in the general case,
while also specializing to direct sampling algorithms in particular cases.
Finally, we present detailed numerical experiments that demonstrate the
efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed sampling approach across a wide
range of prior and posterior sampling problems from Bayesian imaging.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, labelled retinal imaging data, which presents a
significant challenge in the development of machine learning models for
ophthalmology, hinders progress in the field. To synthesise Colour Fundus
Photographs (CFPs), existing methods primarily relying on predefined disease
labels face significant limitations. However, current methods remain limited,
thus failing to generate images for broader categories with diverse and
fine-grained anatomical structures. To overcome these challenges, we first
introduce an innovative pipeline that creates a large-scale, synthetic
Caption-CFP dataset comprising 1.4 million entries, called RetinaLogos-1400k.
Specifically, RetinaLogos-1400k uses large language models (LLMs) to describe
retinal conditions and key structures, such as optic disc configuration,
vascular distribution, nerve fibre layers, and pathological features.
Furthermore, based on this dataset, we employ a novel three-step training
framework, called RetinaLogos, which enables fine-grained semantic control over
retinal images and accurately captures different stages of disease progression,
subtle anatomical variations, and specific lesion types. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, with 62.07%
of text-driven synthetic images indistinguishable from real ones by
ophthalmologists. Moreover, the synthetic data improves accuracy by 10%-25% in
diabetic retinopathy grading and glaucoma detection, thereby providing a
scalable solution to augment ophthalmic datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TMJ病理的高发率及诊断精度与速度的需求推动了研究。现有工具（如Diagnocat、MandSeg）因专注于骨结构而不适用于关节盘研究。

Method: 收集了94张包含“颞下颌关节”和“下颌”类别的图像数据集，采用数据增强方法扩展数据量。训练并比较了U-Net、YOLOv8n、YOLOv11n和Roboflow模型。

Result: Roboflow模型在Dice Score、Precision等指标上表现最佳，证实其在TMJ分割中的潜力。

Conclusion: 未来计划开发测量颌间距离和关节盘位置的算法，以进一步提升TMJ病理诊断能力。

Abstract: This article explores the use of artificial intelligence for the diagnosis of
pathologies of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), in particular, for the
segmentation of the articular disc on MRI images. The relevance of the work is
due to the high prevalence of TMJ pathologies, as well as the need to improve
the accuracy and speed of diagnosis in medical institutions. During the study,
the existing solutions (Diagnocat, MandSeg) were analyzed, which, as a result,
are not suitable for studying the articular disc due to the orientation towards
bone structures. To solve the problem, an original dataset was collected from
94 images with the classes "temporomandibular joint" and "jaw". To increase the
amount of data, augmentation methods were used. After that, the models of
U-Net, YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n and Roboflow neural networks were trained and
compared. The evaluation was carried out according to the Dice Score,
Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Mean Average Precision metrics. The
results confirm the potential of using the Roboflow model for segmentation of
the temporomandibular joint. In the future, it is planned to develop an
algorithm for measuring the distance between the jaws and determining the
position of the articular disc, which will improve the diagnosis of TMJ
pathologies.

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的比率损失函数，用于改进扩散MRI（dMRI）超分辨率成像，通过优化DWI与b=0图像的比率误差，显著提升了扩散度量的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率dMRI成像在时间与信噪比之间存在固有折衷，传统方法仅优化DWI而忽略其与b=0图像的关系，导致扩散度量计算不准确。

Method: 提出比率损失函数，定义为预测与真实DWI/b=0比率的对数之间的均方误差（MSE），并将其纳入优化目标。

Result: 比率损失显著降低了比率误差，略微提升了生成DWI的峰值信噪比（PSNR），改善了dMRI超分辨率和扩散度量的准确性。

Conclusion: 比率损失函数有效提升了dMRI超分辨率成像的质量，尤其适用于基于b=0比率的扩散度量计算。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is essential for studying brain microstructure, but
high-resolution imaging remains challenging due to the inherent trade-offs
between acquisition time and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Conventional methods
often optimize only the diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) without considering
their relationship with the non-diffusion-weighted (b=0) reference images.
However, calculating diffusion metrics, such as the apparent diffusion
coefficient (ADC) and diffusion tensor with its derived metrics like fractional
anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), relies on the ratio between each DWI
and the b=0 image, which is crucial for clinical observation and diagnostics.
In this study, we demonstrate that solely enhancing DWIs using a conventional
pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss is insufficient, as the error in ratio
between generated DWIs and b=0 diverges. We propose a novel ratio loss, defined
as the MSE loss between the predicted and ground-truth log of DWI/b=0 ratios.
Our results show that incorporating the ratio loss significantly improves the
convergence of this ratio error, achieving lower ratio MSE and slightly
enhancing the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of generated DWIs. This leads
to improved dMRI super-resolution and better preservation of b=0 ratio-based
features for the derivation of diffusion metrics.

TLDR: 提出了一种结合解码器网络和扩散模型的混合压缩方案，旨在提升图像保真度同时保持感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成任务中表现出色，但在图像压缩中可能导致保真度下降。本文旨在通过结合解码器网络减少失真。

Method: 使用解码器网络生成初始图像（优化失真），再通过扩散模型预测残差以提升感知质量。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，PSNR提升高达2dB，同时保持与CDC相当的LPIPS和FID分数。

Conclusion: 该方法在图像和视频压缩中均有效，平衡了保真度和感知质量。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models achieved impressive results on several image
generation tasks often outperforming GAN based models. Recently, the generative
capabilities of diffusion models have been employed for perceptual image
compression, such as in CDC. A major drawback of these diffusion-based methods
is that, while producing impressive perceptual quality images they are dropping
in fidelity/increasing the distortion to the original uncompressed images when
compared with other traditional or learned image compression schemes aiming for
fidelity. In this paper, we propose a hybrid compression scheme optimized for
perceptual quality, extending the approach of the CDC model with a decoder
network in order to reduce the impact on distortion metrics such as PSNR. After
using the decoder network to generate an initial image, optimized for
distortion, the latent conditioned diffusion model refines the reconstruction
for perceptual quality by predicting the residual. On standard benchmarks, we
achieve up to +2dB PSNR fidelity improvements while maintaining comparable
LPIPS and FID perceptual scores when compared with CDC. Additionally, the
approach is easily extensible to video compression, where we achieve similar
results.

Abstract: Accurately registering breast MR images from different time points enables
the alignment of anatomical structures and tracking of tumor progression,
supporting more effective breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment
planning. However, the complexity of dense tissue and its highly non-rigid
nature pose challenges for conventional registration methods, which primarily
focus on aligning general structures while overlooking intricate internal
details. To address this, we propose \textbf{GuidedMorph}, a novel two-stage
registration framework designed to better align dense tissue. In addition to a
single-scale network for global structure alignment, we introduce a framework
that utilizes dense tissue information to track breast movement. The learned
transformation fields are fused by introducing the Dual Spatial Transformer
Network (DSTN), improving overall alignment accuracy. A novel warping method
based on the Euclidean distance transform (EDT) is also proposed to accurately
warp the registered dense tissue and breast masks, preserving fine structural
details during deformation. The framework supports paradigms that require
external segmentation models and with image data only. It also operates
effectively with the VoxelMorph and TransMorph backbones, offering a versatile
solution for breast registration. We validate our method on ISPY2 and internal
dataset, demonstrating superior performance in dense tissue, overall breast
alignment, and breast structural similarity index measure (SSIM), with notable
improvements by over 13.01% in dense tissue Dice, 3.13% in breast Dice, and
1.21% in breast SSIM compared to the best learning-based baseline.

Abstract: We propose a unified deep meta-learning framework for accelerated magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) that jointly addresses multi-coil reconstruction and
cross-modality synthesis. Motivated by the limitations of conventional methods
in handling undersampled data and missing modalities, our approach unrolls a
provably convergent optimization algorithm into a structured neural network
architecture. Each phase of the network mimics a step of an adaptive
forward-backward scheme with extrapolation, enabling the model to incorporate
both data fidelity and nonconvex regularization in a principled manner. To
enhance generalization across different acquisition settings, we integrate
meta-learning, which enables the model to rapidly adapt to unseen sampling
patterns and modality combinations using task-specific meta-knowledge. The
proposed method is evaluated on the open source datasets, showing significant
improvements in PSNR and SSIM over conventional supervised learning, especially
under aggressive undersampling and domain shifts. Our results demonstrate the
synergy of unrolled optimization, task-aware meta-learning, and modality
fusion, offering a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world clinical
MRI reconstruction.

Motivation: 当前单模态方法难以捕捉仇恨视频的隐含特征，多模态方法又未能有效整合时间动态和模态交互。

Conclusion: CMFusion通过有效整合多模态特征和时间动态，成功提升了仇恨视频检测的性能。

Abstract: The rapid rise of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has
transformed information dissemination, but it has also facilitated the spread
of harmful content, particularly hate videos. Despite significant efforts to
combat hate speech, detecting these videos remains challenging due to their
often implicit nature. Current detection methods primarily rely on unimodal
approaches, which inadequately capture the complementary features across
different modalities. While multimodal techniques offer a broader perspective,
many fail to effectively integrate temporal dynamics and modality-wise
interactions essential for identifying nuanced hate content. In this paper, we
present CMFusion, an enhanced multimodal hate video detection model utilizing a
novel Channel-wise and Modality-wise Fusion Mechanism. CMFusion first extracts
features from text, audio, and video modalities using pre-trained models and
then incorporates a temporal cross-attention mechanism to capture dependencies
between video and audio streams. The learned features are then processed by
channel-wise and modality-wise fusion modules to obtain informative
representations of videos. Our extensive experiments on a real-world dataset
demonstrate that CMFusion significantly outperforms five widely used baselines
in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Comprehensive ablation
studies and parameter analyses further validate our design choices,
highlighting the model's effectiveness in detecting hate videos. The source

Result: 发现两种小模型共享一致的多义拓扑结构，并证明该结构可被利用以实施有效的干预。

Conclusion: 多义性结构具有稳定性和可迁移性，可能在不同架构和训练方式中普遍存在。

Abstract: Polysemanticity -- where individual neurons encode multiple unrelated
features -- is a well-known characteristic of large neural networks and remains
a central challenge in the interpretability of language models. At the same
time, its implications for model safety are also poorly understood. Leveraging
recent advances in sparse autoencoders, we investigate the polysemantic
structure of two small models (Pythia-70M and GPT-2-Small) and evaluate their
vulnerability to targeted, covert interventions at the prompt, feature, token,
and neuron levels. Our analysis reveals a consistent polysemantic topology
shared across both models. Strikingly, we demonstrate that this structure can
be exploited to mount effective interventions on two larger, black-box
instruction-tuned models (LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct). These
findings suggest not only the generalizability of the interventions but also
point to a stable and transferable polysemantic structure that could
potentially persist across architectures and training regimes.

Abstract: A central goal of cognitive modeling is to develop models that not only

often achieve strong predictive performance, they typically fall short in
offering interpretable explanations of the cognitive processes they capture. In
this work, we explore the potential of pretrained large language models (LLMs)
to serve as dual-purpose cognitive models--capable of both accurate prediction
and interpretable explanation in natural language. Specifically, we employ
reinforcement learning with outcome-based rewards to guide LLMs toward
generating explicit reasoning traces for explaining human risky choices. Our
findings demonstrate that this approach produces high-quality explanations
alongside strong quantitative predictions of human decisions.

Abstract: The Science of Science (SoS) explores the mechanisms underlying scientific
discovery, and offers valuable insights for enhancing scientific efficiency and
fostering innovation. Traditional approaches often rely on simplistic
assumptions and basic statistical tools, such as linear regression and
rule-based simulations, which struggle to capture the complexity and scale of
modern research ecosystems. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) presents
a transformative opportunity for the next generation of SoS, enabling the
automation of large-scale pattern discovery and uncovering insights previously
unattainable. This paper offers a forward-looking perspective on the
integration of Science of Science with AI for automated research pattern
discovery and highlights key open challenges that could greatly benefit from

*Vincent Koc*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: TQB++是一个超轻量级的多语言QA测试套件，用于快速检测LLM管道问题，支持多语言和自定义生成，适合集成到开发流程中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开发过程中等待重型基准测试的问题，提供快速反馈，优化提示工程和模型质量。

Method: 结合52项英语黄金数据集和基于LiteLLM的合成数据生成器，支持多语言和自定义数据集生成。

Result: TQB++能在几秒内完成测试，可靠检测提示模板错误、分词器漂移和微调副作用。

Conclusion: TQB++框架发布，旨在推动生成式AI生态系统中高效、持续的质量保证。

Abstract: Tiny QA Benchmark++ (TQB++) presents an ultra-lightweight, multilingual
smoke-test suite designed to give large-language-model (LLM) pipelines a
unit-test style safety net dataset that runs in seconds with minimal cost. Born
out of the tight feedback-loop demands building the Comet Opik
prompt-optimization SDK, where waiting on heavyweight benchmarks breaks
developer flow. TQB++ couples a 52-item English gold set (less than 20 kB) with
a tiny synthetic-data generator pypi package built on provider-agnostic
LiteLLM. The generator lets practitioners mint their own tiny packs in any
language, domain, or difficulty, while ten ready-made packs already cover
Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian,
Spanish, and Turkish. Every dataset ships with Croissant metadata and
plug-and-play files for OpenAI-Evals, LangChain, and standard CI tools, so
teams can drop deterministic micro-benchmarks directly into pull-request gates,
prompt-engineering loops, and production dashboards without touching GPU
budgets. A complete TQB++ run adds only a few seconds to pipeline latency yet
reliably flags prompt-template errors, tokenizer drift, and fine-tuning
side-effects long before full-scale suites like MMLU or BIG-Bench would finish
configuring. The entire framework is released to accelerate continuous,
resource-efficient quality assurance across the generative-AI ecosystem.

TLDR: SearchAgent-X是一个高效推理框架，解决了基于LLM的搜索代理在检索和推理中的效率瓶颈问题，显著提升了吞吐量和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的搜索代理在动态分解问题和交替进行推理与检索时存在效率瓶颈，包括检索开销大和系统设计低效。

Method: SearchAgent-X采用高召回近似检索，并结合优先级感知调度和非阻塞检索技术。

Result: 实验表明，SearchAgent-X在吞吐量和延迟上显著优于现有系统（如vLLM和HNSW），且不影响生成质量。

Conclusion: SearchAgent-X通过优化检索和调度设计，显著提升了LLM搜索代理的效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based search agents have shown remarkable
capabilities in solving complex tasks by dynamically decomposing problems and
addressing them through interleaved reasoning and retrieval. However, this
interleaved paradigm introduces substantial efficiency bottlenecks. First, we
observe that both highly accurate and overly approximate retrieval methods
degrade system efficiency: exact search incurs significant retrieval overhead,
while coarse retrieval requires additional reasoning steps during generation.
Second, we identify inefficiencies in system design, including improper
scheduling and frequent retrieval stalls, which lead to cascading latency --
where even minor delays in retrieval amplify end-to-end inference time. To
address these challenges, we introduce SearchAgent-X, a high-efficiency
inference framework for LLM-based search agents. SearchAgent-X leverages
high-recall approximate retrieval and incorporates two key techniques:
priority-aware scheduling and non-stall retrieval. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SearchAgent-X consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
systems such as vLLM and HNSW-based retrieval across diverse tasks, achieving
up to 3.4$\times$ higher throughput and 5$\times$ lower latency, without
compromising generation quality. SearchAgent-X is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在交互环境中的规划和推理能力对开发智能AI代理至关重要。

Method: 基于BabyAI网格世界的文本改编，设计了三个任务（Predict、Plan、Decompose），并生成相应数据集和标准化评估工具。

Result: 初步基线结果显示这些任务具有挑战性。

Conclusion: LLM-BabyBench及其相关资源已公开，以促进可重复评估。

Abstract: Assessing the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and reason
within the constraints of interactive environments is crucial for developing
capable AI agents. We introduce $\textbf{LLM-BabyBench}$, a new benchmark suite
designed specifically for this purpose. Built upon a textual adaptation of the
procedurally generated BabyAI grid world, this suite evaluates LLMs on three
fundamental aspects of grounded intelligence: (1) predicting the consequences
of actions on the environment state ($\textbf{Predict}$ task), (2) generating
sequences of low-level actions to achieve specified objectives ($\textbf{Plan}$
task), and (3) decomposing high-level instructions into coherent subgoal
sequences ($\textbf{Decompose}$ task). We detail the methodology for generating
the three corresponding datasets ($\texttt{LLM-BabyBench-Predict}$,
$\texttt{-Plan}$, $\texttt{-Decompose}$) by extracting structured information
from an expert agent operating within the text-based environment. Furthermore,
we provide a standardized evaluation harness and metrics, including environment
interaction for validating generated plans, to facilitate reproducible
assessment of diverse LLMs. Initial baseline results highlight the challenges
posed by these grounded reasoning tasks. The benchmark suite, datasets, data
generation code, and evaluation code are made publicly available

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 论文研究了通过激活引导（activation steering）减少大语言模型（LLMs）在形式推理中的内容偏见，提出动态条件方法（如K-CAST）显著提升推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs常混淆内容合理性（material inference）与逻辑有效性（formal inference），导致偏见推理，影响模型的可信度和泛化能力。

Method: 构建控制性三段论数据集，定位形式与内容推理的层，研究对比激活引导方法，并引入动态条件方法（如K-CAST）。

Result: 对比引导能线性控制内容偏见，静态方法效果有限；动态条件方法（K-CAST）对不响应模型有效，形式推理准确率提升15%。

Conclusion: 激活引导是增强LLMs鲁棒性的可扩展策略，有助于实现更系统、无偏的形式推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently demonstrate reasoning limitations,
often conflating content plausibility (i.e., material inference) with logical
validity (i.e., formal inference). This can result in biased inferences, where
plausible arguments are incorrectly deemed logically valid or vice versa.
Mitigating this limitation is critical, as it undermines the trustworthiness
and generalizability of LLMs in applications that demand rigorous logical
consistency. This paper investigates the problem of mitigating content biases
on formal reasoning through activation steering. Specifically, we curate a
controlled syllogistic reasoning dataset to disentangle formal validity from
content plausibility. After localising the layers responsible for formal and
material inference, we investigate contrastive activation steering methods for
test-time interventions. An extensive empirical analysis on different LLMs
reveals that contrastive steering consistently supports linear control over
content biases. However, we observe that a static approach is insufficient for
improving all the tested models. We then leverage the possibility to control
content effects by dynamically determining the value of the steering parameters
via fine-grained conditional methods. We found that conditional steering is
effective on unresponsive models, achieving up to 15% absolute improvement in
formal reasoning accuracy with a newly introduced kNN-based method (K-CAST).
Finally, additional experiments reveal that steering for content effects is
robust to prompt variations, incurs minimal side effects on language modeling
capabilities, and can partially generalize to out-of-distribution reasoning
tasks. Practically, this paper demonstrates that activation-level interventions
can offer a scalable strategy for enhancing the robustness of LLMs,
contributing towards more systematic and unbiased formal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过增加训练数据和阶段来缩短推理路径，但增加了成本。本文旨在直接优化推理过程以减少响应长度。

Method: 在强化学习过程中集成三种关键奖励设计，直接减少响应长度。

Result: 在四种实验设置中，响应长度显著减少，性能保持或提升。逻辑推理中响应长度减少40%，性能提升14%；数学问题中长度减少33%，性能不变。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少推理模型的响应长度，同时保持或提升性能，无需额外训练阶段。

Abstract: Large reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 or DeepSeek R1, have demonstrated
remarkable performance on reasoning tasks but often incur a long reasoning path
with significant memory and time costs. Existing methods primarily aim to
shorten reasoning paths by introducing additional training data and stages. In
this paper, we propose three critical reward designs integrated directly into
the reinforcement learning process of large reasoning models, which reduce the
response length without extra training stages. Experiments on four settings
show that our method significantly decreases response length while maintaining
or even improving performance. Specifically, in a logic reasoning setting, we
achieve a 40% reduction in response length averaged by steps alongside a 14%
gain in performance. For math problems, we reduce response length averaged by
steps by 33% while preserving performance.

TLDR: 提出了一种新的LLM评估框架，通过分布对齐提升评估的多样性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM评估方法依赖单点评估，忽略了人类评估的多样性和不确定性，导致信息丢失和可靠性下降。

Method: 提出基于KL散度的分布对齐目标，结合交叉熵正则化稳定训练，并引入对抗训练增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在多种LLM和任务中显著优于现有方法，提升了对齐质量、评估准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了单点评估的局限性，为LLM评估提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful evaluators in the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm,
offering significant efficiency and flexibility compared to human judgments.
However, previous methods primarily rely on single-point evaluations,
overlooking the inherent diversity and uncertainty in human evaluations. This
approach leads to information loss and decreases the reliability of
evaluations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel training framework
that explicitly aligns the LLM-generated judgment distribution with empirical
human distributions. Specifically, we propose a distributional alignment
objective based on KL divergence, combined with an auxiliary cross-entropy
regularization to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, considering that
empirical distributions may derive from limited human annotations, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance model robustness against
distribution perturbations. Extensive experiments across various LLM backbones
and evaluation tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing closed-source LLMs and conventional single-point alignment methods,
with improved alignment quality, evaluation accuracy, and robustness.

Conclusion: 需根据任务特性选择AI解决方案，多智能体协作的复杂性和开销需与性能提升权衡。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has stimulated interest
in multi-agent collaboration for addressing complex medical tasks. However, the
practical advantages of multi-agent collaboration approaches remain
insufficiently understood. Existing evaluations often lack generalizability,
failing to cover diverse tasks reflective of real-world clinical practice, and
frequently omit rigorous comparisons against both single-LLM-based and
established conventional methods. To address this critical gap, we introduce
MedAgentBoard, a comprehensive benchmark for the systematic evaluation of
multi-agent collaboration, single-LLM, and conventional approaches.
MedAgentBoard encompasses four diverse medical task categories: (1) medical
(visual) question answering, (2) lay summary generation, (3) structured
Electronic Health Record (EHR) predictive modeling, and (4) clinical workflow
automation, across text, medical images, and structured EHR data. Our extensive
experiments reveal a nuanced landscape: while multi-agent collaboration
demonstrates benefits in specific scenarios, such as enhancing task
completeness in clinical workflow automation, it does not consistently
outperform advanced single LLMs (e.g., in textual medical QA) or, critically,
specialized conventional methods that generally maintain better performance in
tasks like medical VQA and EHR-based prediction. MedAgentBoard offers a vital
resource and actionable insights, emphasizing the necessity of a task-specific,
evidence-based approach to selecting and developing AI solutions in medicine.
It underscores that the inherent complexity and overhead of multi-agent
collaboration must be carefully weighed against tangible performance gains. All
code, datasets, detailed prompts, and experimental results are open-sourced at

Method: 提出mCLM模型，将分子分解为功能模块，并学习功能描述与模块的双语语言模型。

Result: 在430种FDA批准药物上测试，mCLM显著改善了5/6关键化学功能，并能优化被FDA拒绝的药物。

Conclusion: mCLM通过功能模块化方法，显著提升了分子生成的可合成性和功能性。

Abstract: Despite their ability to understand chemical knowledge and accurately
generate sequential representations, large language models (LLMs) remain
limited in their capacity to propose novel molecules with drug-like properties.
In addition, the molecules that LLMs propose can often be challenging to make
in the lab. To more effectively enable the discovery of functional small
molecules, LLMs need to learn a molecular language. However, LLMs are currently
limited by encoding molecules from atoms. In this paper, we argue that just
like tokenizing texts into (sub-)word tokens instead of characters, molecules
should be decomposed and reassembled at the level of functional building
blocks, i.e., parts of molecules that bring unique functions and serve as
effective building blocks for real-world automated laboratory synthesis. This
motivates us to propose mCLM, a modular Chemical-Language Model tokenizing
molecules into building blocks and learning a bilingual language model of both
natural language descriptions of functions and molecule building blocks. By
reasoning on such functional building blocks, mCLM guarantees to generate
efficiently synthesizable molecules thanks to recent progress in block-based
chemistry, while also improving the functions of molecules in a principled
manner. In experiments on 430 FDA-approved drugs, we find mCLM capable of
significantly improving 5 out of 6 chemical functions critical to determining
drug potentials. More importantly, mCLM can reason on multiple functions and
improve the FDA-rejected drugs (``fallen angels'') over multiple iterations to
greatly improve their shortcomings.

Method: 引入Ineq-Comp基准，通过变量复制、代数重写和多步组合等系统变换测试证明助手。

Result: 大多数证明助手（如Goedel、STP、Kimina-7B）表现不佳，DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B相对稳健但仍下降20%。

Conclusion: 当前AI证明助手在组合推理能力上与人类数学直觉存在显著差距。

Abstract: LLM-based formal proof assistants (e.g., in Lean) hold great promise for
automating mathematical discovery. But beyond syntactic correctness, do these
systems truly understand mathematical structure as humans do? We investigate
this question through the lens of mathematical inequalities -- a fundamental
tool across many domains. While modern provers can solve basic inequalities, we
probe their ability to handle human-intuitive compositionality. We introduce
Ineq-Comp, a benchmark built from elementary inequalities through systematic
transformations, including variable duplication, algebraic rewriting, and
multi-step composition. Although these problems remain easy for humans, we find
that most provers -- including Goedel, STP, and Kimina-7B -- struggle
significantly. DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B shows relative robustness -- possibly
because it is trained to decompose the problems into sub-problems -- but still
suffers a 20\% performance drop (pass@32). Strikingly, performance remains poor
for all models even when formal proofs of the constituent parts are provided in
context, revealing that the source of weakness is indeed in compositional
reasoning. Our results expose a persisting gap between the generalization
behavior of current AI provers and human mathematical intuition.

Conclusion: 人格驱动交互为LLMs安全风险提供新途径，需人格感知的安全评估和对齐策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactions where
they are prompted to adopt personas. This paper investigates whether such
persona conditioning affects model safety under bullying, an adversarial
manipulation that applies psychological pressures in order to force the victim
to comply to the attacker. We introduce a simulation framework in which an
attacker LLM engages a victim LLM using psychologically grounded bullying
tactics, while the victim adopts personas aligned with the Big Five personality
traits. Experiments using multiple open-source LLMs and a wide range of
adversarial goals reveal that certain persona configurations -- such as
weakened agreeableness or conscientiousness -- significantly increase victim's
susceptibility to unsafe outputs. Bullying tactics involving emotional or
sarcastic manipulation, such as gaslighting and ridicule, are particularly
effective. These findings suggest that persona-driven interaction introduces a
novel vector for safety risks in LLMs and highlight the need for persona-aware
safety evaluation and alignment strategies.

Motivation: 随着大型推理模型在多步推理任务中的成功，推理幻觉问题逐渐显现，即逻辑连贯但事实错误的推理导致错误结论。这种错误更难检测且危害更大。

Method: 提出推理评分（Reasoning Score），通过测量模型后期层到词汇空间的投影差异来量化推理深度；开发推理幻觉检测框架（RHD）和改进的强化学习算法（GRPO-R）。

Conclusion: 论文通过量化推理深度和开发检测与缓解方法，为理解和解决推理幻觉问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in
multi-step reasoning tasks. However, alongside these successes, a more
deceptive form of model error has emerged--Reasoning Hallucination--where
logically coherent but factually incorrect reasoning traces lead to persuasive
yet faulty conclusions. Unlike traditional hallucinations, these errors are
embedded within structured reasoning, making them more difficult to detect and
potentially more harmful. In this work, we investigate reasoning hallucinations
from a mechanistic perspective. We propose the Reasoning Score, which
quantifies the depth of reasoning by measuring the divergence between logits
obtained from projecting late layers of LRMs to the vocabulary space,
effectively distinguishing shallow pattern-matching from genuine deep
reasoning. Using this score, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the ReTruthQA
dataset and identify two key reasoning hallucination patterns: early-stage
fluctuation in reasoning depth and incorrect backtracking to flawed prior
steps. These insights motivate our Reasoning Hallucination Detection (RHD)
framework, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains.
To mitigate reasoning hallucinations, we further introduce GRPO-R, an enhanced
reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates step-level deep reasoning
rewards via potential-based shaping. Our theoretical analysis establishes
stronger generalization guarantees, and experiments demonstrate improved
reasoning quality and reduced hallucination rates.

summarized the impact of test-time scaling on temporal reasoning capabilities.
Additionally, we release TIME-Lite, a human-annotated subset to foster future

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist developing program code
beside many other things, but can they support working with Knowledge Graphs
(KGs) as well? Which LLM is offering the best capabilities in the field of
Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph Engineering (KGE)? Is this possible to
determine without checking many answers manually? The LLM-KG-Bench framework in
Version 3.0 is designed to answer these questions. It consists of an extensible
set of tasks for automated evaluation of LLM answers and covers different
aspects of working with semantic technologies. In this paper the LLM-KG-Bench
framework is presented in Version 3 along with a dataset of prompts, answers
and evaluations generated with it and several state-of-the-art LLMs.
Significant enhancements have been made to the framework since its initial
release, including an updated task API that offers greater flexibility in
handling evaluation tasks, revised tasks, and extended support for various open
models through the vllm library, among other improvements. A comprehensive
dataset has been generated using more than 30 contemporary open and proprietary
LLMs, enabling the creation of exemplary model cards that demonstrate the
models' capabilities in working with RDF and SPARQL, as well as comparing their
performance on Turtle and JSON-LD RDF serialization tasks.

Abstract: In planning, using LLMs not to predict plans but to formalize an environment

improve performance and control. While most work focused on fully observable
environments, we tackle the more realistic and challenging partially observable
environments where existing methods are incapacitated by the lack of complete
information. We propose PDDLego+, a framework to iteratively formalize, plan,
grow, and refine PDDL representations in a zero-shot manner, without needing
access to any existing trajectories. On two textual simulated environments, we
show that PDDLego+ not only achieves superior performance, but also shows
robustness against problem complexity. We also show that the domain knowledge
captured after a successful trial is interpretable and benefits future tasks.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding, the ability to map natural language
instructions to specific actions on graphical user interfaces, remains a
critical bottleneck in computer use agent development. Current benchmarks
oversimplify grounding tasks as short referring expressions, failing to capture
the complexity of real-world interactions that require software commonsense,
layout understanding, and fine-grained manipulation capabilities. To address
these limitations, we introduce OSWorld-G, a comprehensive benchmark comprising
564 finely annotated samples across diverse task types including text matching,
element recognition, layout understanding, and precise manipulation.
Additionally, we synthesize and release the largest computer use grounding
dataset Jedi, which contains 4 million examples through multi-perspective
decoupling of tasks. Our multi-scale models trained on Jedi demonstrate its
effectiveness by outperforming existing approaches on ScreenSpot-v2,
ScreenSpot-Pro, and our OSWorld-G. Furthermore, we demonstrate that improved
grounding with Jedi directly enhances agentic capabilities of general
foundation models on complex computer tasks, improving from 5% to 27% on
OSWorld. Through detailed ablation studies, we identify key factors
contributing to grounding performance and verify that combining specialized
data for different interface elements enables compositional generalization to
novel interfaces. All benchmark, data, checkpoints, and code are open-sourced
and available at https://osworld-grounding.github.io.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为CompeteSMoE的新方法，通过竞争机制优化稀疏混合专家（SMoE）的路由过程，提高了样本效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SMoE训练中，路由过程存在不足，导致计算专家不直接参与路由决策，影响了训练效果。

Method: 引入竞争机制，将令牌路由到具有最高神经响应的专家，并开发了CompeteSMoE算法，通过路由器学习竞争策略。

Result: 在视觉指令调整和语言预训练任务中，CompeteSMoE表现出高效性、鲁棒性和可扩展性，优于现有SMoE方法。

Conclusion: CompeteSMoE通过优化路由机制，显著提升了SMoE的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) offers an appealing solution to scale up the
model complexity beyond the mean of increasing the network's depth or width.
However, we argue that effective SMoE training remains challenging because of
the suboptimal routing process where experts that perform computation do not
directly contribute to the routing process. In this work, we propose
competition, a novel mechanism to route tokens to experts with the highest
neural response. Theoretically, we show that the competition mechanism enjoys a
better sample efficiency than the traditional softmax routing. Furthermore, we
develop CompeteSMoE, a simple yet effective algorithm to train large language
models by deploying a router to learn the competition policy, thus enjoying
strong performances at a low training overhead. Our extensive empirical
evaluations on both the visual instruction tuning and language pre-training
tasks demonstrate the efficacy, robustness, and scalability of CompeteSMoE
compared to state-of-the-art SMoE strategies. We have made the implementation
available at: https://github.com/Fsoft-AIC/CompeteSMoE. This work is an
improved version of the previous study at arXiv:2402.02526

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于经典力学的CoT-Kinetics能量方程，用于评估大型推理模型（LRM）生成推理轨迹的合理性，从而更准确地衡量输出答案的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估LRM输出时，未能充分反映推理部分与答案之间的因果关系，导致对答案质量的判断不够准确。

Method: 受经典力学启发，提出CoT-Kinetics能量方程，将LRM内部变换层的状态转换过程类比为力学场中的粒子动力学，为推理阶段分配标量评分。

Result: CoT-Kinetics能量方程能够专门评估推理阶段的合理性，从而更准确地衡量LRM输出答案的置信度。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了LRM输出质量的评估精度，超越了传统的二元判断（正确或错误）。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models significantly improve the reasoning ability of
Large Language Models by learning to reason, exhibiting the promising
performance in solving complex tasks. LRMs solve tasks that require complex
reasoning by explicitly generating reasoning trajectories together with
answers. Nevertheless, judging the quality of such an output answer is not easy
because only considering the correctness of the answer is not enough and the
soundness of the reasoning trajectory part matters as well. Logically, if the
soundness of the reasoning part is poor, even if the answer is correct, the
confidence of the derived answer should be low. Existing methods did consider
jointly assessing the overall output answer by taking into account the
reasoning part, however, their capability is still not satisfactory as the
causal relationship of the reasoning to the concluded answer cannot properly
reflected. In this paper, inspired by classical mechanics, we present a novel
approach towards establishing a CoT-Kinetics energy equation. Specifically, our
CoT-Kinetics energy equation formulates the token state transformation process,
which is regulated by LRM internal transformer layers, as like a particle
kinetics dynamics governed in a mechanical field. Our CoT-Kinetics energy
assigns a scalar score to evaluate specifically the soundness of the reasoning
phase, telling how confident the derived answer could be given the evaluated
reasoning. As such, the LRM's overall output quality can be accurately
measured, rather than a coarse judgment (e.g., correct or incorrect) anymore.

TLDR: RISE框架通过在线强化学习同时提升LLMs的问题解决和自我验证能力，显著提高推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在复杂推理中存在的‘表面自我反思’问题，即模型无法有效验证自身输出。

Method: 提出RISE框架，利用可验证奖励在单一RL过程中同时训练问题解决和自我验证能力，通过实时反馈优化模型。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，RISE显著提升模型的问题解决准确性和自我验证能力。

Conclusion: RISE为开发更鲁棒和自知的推理模型提供了灵活有效的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in complex reasoning, with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) being a key enhancement
strategy. However, a prevalent issue is ``superficial self-reflection'', where
models fail to robustly verify their own outputs. We introduce RISE
(Reinforcing Reasoning with Self-Verification), a novel online RL framework
designed to tackle this. RISE explicitly and simultaneously trains an LLM to
improve both its problem-solving and self-verification abilities within a
single, integrated RL process. The core mechanism involves leveraging
verifiable rewards from an outcome verifier to provide on-the-fly feedback for
both solution generation and self-verification tasks. In each iteration, the
model generates solutions, then critiques its own on-policy generated
solutions, with both trajectories contributing to the policy update. Extensive
experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that RISE
consistently improves model's problem-solving accuracy while concurrently
fostering strong self-verification skills. Our analyses highlight the
advantages of online verification and the benefits of increased verification
compute. Additionally, RISE models exhibit more frequent and accurate
self-verification behaviors during reasoning. These advantages reinforce RISE
as a flexible and effective path towards developing more robust and self-aware
reasoners.

TLDR: 论文提出StarFT框架，通过正则化防止零样本模型在微调时学习虚假特征，提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本模型（如CLIP）在微调时容易学习虚假特征（如背景或纹理），导致鲁棒性下降。

Method: 提出StarFT框架，引入正则化，将虚假标签注入的输出分布与原始零样本模型对齐，防止模型学习无关特征。

Result: StarFT在Waterbirds场景中，最差组和平均准确率分别提升14.30%和3.02%。

Conclusion: StarFT有效提升零样本模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning robust representations from data often requires scale, which has led
to the success of recent zero-shot models such as CLIP. However, the obtained
robustness can easily be deteriorated when these models are fine-tuned on other
downstream tasks (e.g., of smaller scales). Previous works often interpret this
phenomenon in the context of domain shift, developing fine-tuning methods that
aim to preserve the original domain as much as possible. However, in a
different context, fine-tuned models with limited data are also prone to
learning features that are spurious to humans, such as background or texture.
In this paper, we propose StarFT (Spurious Textual Alignment Regularization), a
novel framework for fine-tuning zero-shot models to enhance robustness by
preventing them from learning spuriosity. We introduce a regularization that
aligns the output distribution for spuriosity-injected labels with the original
zero-shot model, ensuring that the model is not induced to extract irrelevant
features further from these descriptions.We leverage recent language models to
get such spuriosity-injected labels by generating alternative textual
descriptions that highlight potentially confounding features.Extensive
experiments validate the robust generalization of StarFT and its emerging
properties: zero-shot group robustness and improved zero-shot classification.
Notably, StarFT boosts both worst-group and average accuracy by 14.30% and
3.02%, respectively, in the Waterbirds group shift scenario, where other robust
fine-tuning baselines show even degraded performance.

Result: 在Raven渐进矩阵等AVR基准测试中，PoNG模型表现出强大的泛化能力，部分场景优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PoNG架构显著提升了AVR任务的泛化性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The abstract visual reasoning (AVR) domain presents a diverse suite of
analogy-based tasks devoted to studying model generalization. Recent years have
brought dynamic progress in the field, particularly in i.i.d. scenarios, in
which models are trained and evaluated on the same data distributions.
Nevertheless, o.o.d. setups that assess model generalization to new test
distributions remain challenging even for the most recent models. To advance
generalization in AVR tasks, we present the Pathways of Normalized Group
Convolution model (PoNG), a novel neural architecture that features group
convolution, normalization, and a parallel design. We consider a wide set of
AVR benchmarks, including Raven's Progressive Matrices and visual analogy
problems with both synthetic and real-world images. The experiments demonstrate
strong generalization capabilities of the proposed model, which in several
settings outperforms the existing literature methods.

TLDR: MM-PRM提出了一种基于过程奖励模型的方法，通过自动化框架增强多模态推理的逻辑一致性，显著提升了多步推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂多步推理任务中表现不佳，缺乏对中间推理步骤的细粒度监督。

Method: 构建MM-Policy模型和MM-K12数据集，利用MCTS生成大量无标注的步骤级注释，训练过程奖励模型（PRM）用于推理路径评分。

Result: 在MM-K12测试集及外部基准（如OlympiadBench、MathVista）上均取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 过程监督是增强多模态推理系统逻辑鲁棒性的有效工具，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive
progress in vision-language understanding, they still struggle with complex
multi-step reasoning, often producing logically inconsistent or partially
correct solutions. A key limitation lies in the lack of fine-grained
supervision over intermediate reasoning steps. To address this, we propose
MM-PRM, a process reward model trained within a fully automated, scalable
framework. We first build MM-Policy, a strong multimodal model trained on
diverse mathematical reasoning data. Then, we construct MM-K12, a curated
dataset of 10,000 multimodal math problems with verifiable answers, which
serves as seed data. Leveraging a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based
pipeline, we generate over 700k step-level annotations without human labeling.
The resulting PRM is used to score candidate reasoning paths in the Best-of-N
inference setup and achieves significant improvements across both in-domain
(MM-K12 test set) and out-of-domain (OlympiadBench, MathVista, etc.)
benchmarks. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of soft labels, smaller
learning rates, and path diversity in optimizing PRM performance. MM-PRM
demonstrates that process supervision is a powerful tool for enhancing the
logical robustness of multimodal reasoning systems. We release all our codes
and data at https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-PRM.

Abstract: The data landscape is rich with structured data, often of high value to
organizations, driving important applications in data analysis and machine
learning. Recent progress in representation learning and generative models for
such data has led to the development of natural language interfaces to
structured data, including those leveraging text-to-SQL. Contextualizing
interactions, either through conversational interfaces or agentic components,
in structured data through retrieval-augmented generation can provide
substantial benefits in the form of freshness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness
of answers. The key question is: how do we retrieve the right table(s) for the
analytical query or task at hand? To this end, we introduce TARGET: a benchmark
for evaluating TAble Retrieval for GEnerative Tasks. With TARGET we analyze the
retrieval performance of different retrievers in isolation, as well as their
impact on downstream tasks. We find that dense embedding-based retrievers far
outperform a BM25 baseline which is less effective than it is for retrieval
over unstructured text. We also surface the sensitivity of retrievers across
various metadata (e.g., missing table titles), and demonstrate a stark
variation of retrieval performance across datasets and tasks. TARGET is

Motivation: 现有视觉文档检索评估基准主要集中在英语、依赖合成问题且语料库规模小，无法满足多语言和复杂布局文档的需求。

Method: 通过消除语料库中的“简单”负样本，设计了一个更具挑战性的评估方法，并进行了广泛的实验比较。

Result: 实验表明，基于视觉的检索模型在多语言能力上存在显著差距，检索准确率比基于文本的模型低59.7%。

Conclusion: MIRACL-VISION是一个具有挑战性和代表性的多语言评估基准，有助于推动视觉文档检索模型的开发。

Abstract: Document retrieval is an important task for search and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have contributed to
improving the accuracy of text-based document retrieval. However, documents
with complex layout and visual elements like tables, charts and infographics
are not perfectly represented in textual format. Recently, image-based document
retrieval pipelines have become popular, which use visual large language models
(VLMs) to retrieve relevant page images given a query. Current evaluation
benchmarks on visual document retrieval are limited, as they primarily focus
only English language, rely on synthetically generated questions and offer a
small corpus size. Therefore, we introduce MIRACL-VISION, a multilingual visual
document retrieval evaluation benchmark. MIRACL-VISION covers 18 languages, and
is an extension of the MIRACL dataset, a popular benchmark to evaluate
text-based multilingual retrieval pipelines. MIRACL was built using a
human-intensive annotation process to generate high-quality questions. In order
to reduce MIRACL-VISION corpus size to make evaluation more compute friendly
while keeping the datasets challenging, we have designed a method for
eliminating the "easy" negatives from the corpus. We conducted extensive
experiments comparing MIRACL-VISION with other benchmarks, using popular public
text and image models. We observe a gap in state-of-the-art VLM-based embedding
models on multilingual capabilities, with up to 59.7% lower retrieval accuracy
than a text-based retrieval models. Even for the English language, the visual
models retrieval accuracy is 12.1% lower compared to text-based models.
MIRACL-VISION is a challenging, representative, multilingual evaluation
benchmark for visual retrieval pipelines and will help the community build
robust models for document retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM显著提升了检索能力，但其深度参数化导致查询推断速度慢且在线部署资源需求高。因此，需要一种高效且轻量级的查询编码方法。

Method: 保留完整大小的LLM用于文档编码，但将查询编码的工作量减少到不超过嵌入查找的程度。

Result: 在H800 GPU上，查询推断速度提升超过1000倍；无GPU时提升20倍。在大规模检索基准测试中，平均保留95%的完整性能。

Conclusion: LightRetriever在保持高性能的同时，显著提升了检索效率，适用于多样化的检索任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based hybrid retrieval uses LLMs to encode
queries and documents into low-dimensional dense or high-dimensional sparse
vectors. It retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector
similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in
real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs
significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs
slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online
deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel
LLM-based hybrid retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our
method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload
of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a
full-sized LLM on an H800 GPU, our approach achieves over a 1000x speedup for
query inference with GPU acceleration, and even a 20x speedup without GPU.
Experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method
generalizes well across diverse retrieval tasks, retaining an average of 95%
full-sized performance.

Abstract: AI-enhanced personality assessments are increasingly shaping hiring
decisions, using affective computing to predict traits from the Big Five
(OCEAN) model. However, integrating AI into these assessments raises ethical
concerns, especially around bias amplification rooted in training data. These
biases can lead to discriminatory outcomes based on protected attributes like
gender, ethnicity, and age. To address this, we introduce a
counterfactual-based framework to systematically evaluate and quantify bias in
AI-driven personality assessments. Our approach employs generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to generate counterfactual representations of job applicants by
altering protected attributes, enabling fairness analysis without access to the
underlying model. Unlike traditional bias assessments that focus on unimodal or
static data, our method supports multimodal evaluation-spanning visual, audio,
and textual features. This comprehensive approach is particularly important in
high-stakes applications like hiring, where third-party vendors often provide
AI systems as black boxes. Applied to a state-of-the-art personality prediction
model, our method reveals significant disparities across demographic groups. We
also validate our framework using a protected attribute classifier to confirm
the effectiveness of our counterfactual generation. This work provides a
scalable tool for fairness auditing of commercial AI hiring platforms,
especially in black-box settings where training data and model internals are
inaccessible. Our results highlight the importance of counterfactual approaches
in improving ethical transparency in affective computing.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）和多智能体系统（MAS）的快速发展，保护知识产权（IP）的需求日益突出。

Method: MASLEAK通过精心设计的攻击查询，在无先验知识的情况下，从MAS中提取系统拓扑、提示、任务指令等敏感信息。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实MAS应用中，MASLEAK平均攻击成功率为87%（提示和指令）和92%（系统架构）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MAS的IP泄露风险，并探讨了潜在防御措施。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the
emergence of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to perform complex tasks through
collaboration. However, the intricate nature of MAS, including their
architecture and agent interactions, raises significant concerns regarding
intellectual property (IP) protection. In this paper, we introduce MASLEAK, a
novel attack framework designed to extract sensitive information from MAS
applications. MASLEAK targets a practical, black-box setting, where the
adversary has no prior knowledge of the MAS architecture or agent
configurations. The adversary can only interact with the MAS through its public
API, submitting attack query $q$ and observing outputs from the final agent.
Inspired by how computer worms propagate and infect vulnerable network hosts,
MASLEAK carefully crafts adversarial query $q$ to elicit, propagate, and retain
responses from each MAS agent that reveal a full set of proprietary components,
including the number of agents, system topology, system prompts, task
instructions, and tool usages. We construct the first synthetic dataset of MAS
applications with 810 applications and also evaluate MASLEAK against real-world
MAS applications, including Coze and CrewAI. MASLEAK achieves high accuracy in
extracting MAS IP, with an average attack success rate of 87% for system
prompts and task instructions, and 92% for system architecture in most cases.
We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and the potential
defenses.

Motivation: LLM在关键系统中的广泛应用带来了安全风险，但现有安全工具缺乏正式评估，研究填补了这一空白。

Method: 构建恶意提示基准数据集，比较7种工具与基线模型的性能。

Result: 基线模型误报率高，Lakera Guard和ProtectAI LLM Guard在性能和可用性上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 建议提高闭源工具的透明度、改进上下文感知检测、增强开源参与、提升用户意识并采用更具代表性的性能指标。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into critical
systems in industries like healthcare and finance. Users can often submit
queries to LLM-enabled chatbots, some of which can enrich responses with
information retrieved from internal databases storing sensitive data. This
gives rise to a range of attacks in which a user submits a malicious query and
the LLM-system outputs a response that creates harm to the owner, such as
leaking internal data or creating legal liability by harming a third-party.
While security tools are being developed to counter these threats, there is
little formal evaluation of their effectiveness and usability. This study
addresses this gap by conducting a thorough comparative analysis of LLM
security tools. We identified 13 solutions (9 closed-source, 4 open-source),
but only 7 were evaluated due to a lack of participation by proprietary model
owners.To evaluate, we built a benchmark dataset of malicious prompts, and
evaluate these tools performance against a baseline LLM model
(ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo). Our results show that the baseline model has too many
false positives to be used for this task. Lakera Guard and ProtectAI LLM Guard
emerged as the best overall tools showcasing the tradeoff between usability and
performance. The study concluded with recommendations for greater transparency
among closed source providers, improved context-aware detections, enhanced
open-source engagement, increased user awareness, and the adoption of more
representative performance metrics.

Abstract: Quantum approaches to natural language processing (NLP) are redefining how
linguistic information is represented and processed. While traditional hybrid
quantum-classical models rely heavily on classical neural networks, recent
advancements propose a novel framework, DisCoCirc, capable of directly encoding
entire documents as parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs), besides enjoying
some additional interpretability and compositionality benefits. Following these
ideas, this paper introduces an efficient methodology for converting
large-scale texts into quantum circuits using tree-like representations of
pregroup diagrams. Exploiting the compositional parallels between language and
quantum mechanics, grounded in symmetric monoidal categories, our approach
enables faithful and efficient encoding of syntactic and discourse
relationships in long and complex texts (up to 6410 words in our experiments)
to quantum circuits. The developed system is provided to the community as part

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant success in enhancing
reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). One of the most widely
used RL methods is Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)~\cite{Shao-2024-Deepseekmath}, known for its memory efficiency and
success in training DeepSeek-R1~\cite{Guo-2025-Deepseek}. However, GRPO stalls
when all sampled responses in a group are incorrect -- referred to as an
\emph{all-negative-sample} group -- as it fails to update the policy, hindering
learning progress. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we
propose a simple yet effective framework that introduces response diversity
within all-negative-sample groups in GRPO using AI feedback. We also provide a
theoretical analysis, via a stylized model, showing how this diversification
improves learning dynamics. Second, we empirically validate our approach,
showing the improved performance across various model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in
both offline and online learning settings with 10 benchmarks, including base
and distilled variants. Our findings highlight that learning from
all-negative-sample groups is not only feasible but beneficial, advancing
recent insights from \citet{Xiong-2025-Minimalist}.

<details>

Motivation: 现有攻击方法在有效性、隐蔽性或实用性上存在不足，EnvInjection旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 通过优化问题设计扰动，训练神经网络近似非可微的像素到截图映射，并使用投影梯度下降求解。

Result: 在多个网页数据集上评估，EnvInjection表现出高有效性，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: EnvInjection是一种高效且实用的攻击方法，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with
webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the
webpages. Environmental prompt injection attacks manipulate the environment to
induce the web agent to perform a specific, attacker-chosen action--referred to
as the target action. However, existing attacks suffer from limited
effectiveness or stealthiness, or are impractical in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose EnvInjection, a new attack that addresses these
limitations. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the
rendered webpage, which can be implemented by modifying the webpage's source
code. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the
perturbation induces the web agent to perform the target action. We formulate
the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key
challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values
and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate
gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to
approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the
reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple webpage
datasets shows that EnvInjection is highly effective and significantly
outperforms existing baselines.

Conclusion: 蒸馏方法能有效将训练数据的不确定性估计能力泛化到测试数据，实现高效且可靠的LLM不确定性估计。

Abstract: Recent advances in uncertainty estimation for Large Language Models (LLMs)
during downstream adaptation have addressed key challenges of reliability and
simplicity. However, existing Bayesian methods typically require multiple
sampling iterations during inference, creating significant efficiency issues
that limit practical deployment. In this paper, we investigate the possibility
of eliminating the need for test-time sampling for LLM uncertainty estimation.
Specifically, when given an off-the-shelf Bayesian LLM, we distill its aligned
confidence into a non-Bayesian student LLM by minimizing the divergence between
their predictive distributions. Unlike typical calibration methods, our
distillation is carried out solely on the training dataset without the need of
an additional validation dataset. This simple yet effective approach achieves
N-times more efficient uncertainty estimation during testing, where N is the
number of samples traditionally required by Bayesian LLMs. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that uncertainty estimation capabilities on training
data can successfully generalize to unseen test data through our distillation
technique, consistently producing results comparable to (or even better than)
state-of-the-art Bayesian LLMs.

Motivation: LLMs的输出质量在不同应用场景中不一致，尤其在复杂任务中难以识别可信响应。

Conclusion: 该方法优于现有不确定性估计方法，为LLMs的推理生成提供了有效的评估和改进工具。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities,
their output quality remains inconsistent across various application scenarios,
making it difficult to identify trustworthy responses, especially in complex
tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a token-level
uncertainty estimation framework to enable LLMs to self-assess and self-improve
their generation quality in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we introduce
low-rank random weight perturbation to LLM decoding, generating predictive
distributions that we use to estimate token-level uncertainties. We then
aggregate these uncertainties to reflect semantic uncertainty of the generated
sequences. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets of varying difficulty
demonstrate that our token-level uncertainty metrics strongly correlate with
answer correctness and model robustness. Additionally, we explore using
uncertainty to directly enhance the model's reasoning performance through
multiple generations and the particle filtering algorithm. Our approach
consistently outperforms existing uncertainty estimation methods, establishing
effective uncertainty estimation as a valuable tool for both evaluating and
improving reasoning generation in LLMs.

*David Chanin,Tomáš Dulka,Adrià Garriga-Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨SAEs在分解多义激活时因特征相关性和SAE宽度不足导致的问题，即特征对冲现象。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，研究特征对冲现象，并提出改进的matryoshka SAEs。

Result: 发现特征对冲是SAEs表现不佳的核心原因之一，改进方法有望提升性能。

Conclusion: 特征对冲是SAEs的根本问题，但通过改进有望实现其在解释LLMs中的潜力。

Abstract: It is assumed that sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose polysemantic
activations into interpretable linear directions, as long as the activations
are composed of sparse linear combinations of underlying features. However, we
find that if an SAE is more narrow than the number of underlying "true
features" on which it is trained, and there is correlation between features,
the SAE will merge components of correlated features together, thus destroying
monosemanticity. In LLM SAEs, these two conditions are almost certainly true.
This phenomenon, which we call feature hedging, is caused by SAE reconstruction
loss, and is more severe the narrower the SAE. In this work, we introduce the
problem of feature hedging and study it both theoretically in toy models and
empirically in SAEs trained on LLMs. We suspect that feature hedging may be one
of the core reasons that SAEs consistently underperform supervised baselines.
Finally, we use our understanding of feature hedging to propose an improved
variant of matryoshka SAEs. Our work shows there remain fundamental issues with
SAEs, but we are hopeful that that highlighting feature hedging will catalyze
future advances that allow SAEs to achieve their full potential of interpreting
LLMs at scale.

Result: 两种方法在分布内和分布外数据上均表现优异，AUC-ROC高，优于非因果方法。

Conclusion: 研究展示了语言模型内部因果分析的新应用，验证了因果机制在预测模型行为中的关键作用。

Abstract: Interpretability research now offers a variety of techniques for identifying
abstract internal mechanisms in neural networks. Can such techniques be used to
predict how models will behave on out-of-distribution examples? In this work,
we provide a positive answer to this question. Through a diverse set of
language modeling tasks--including symbol manipulation, knowledge retrieval,
and instruction following--we show that the most robust features for
correctness prediction are those that play a distinctive causal role in the
model's behavior. Specifically, we propose two methods that leverage causal
mechanisms to predict the correctness of model outputs: counterfactual
simulation (checking whether key causal variables are realized) and value
probing (using the values of those variables to make predictions). Both achieve
high AUC-ROC in distribution and outperform methods that rely on
causal-agnostic features in out-of-distribution settings, where predicting
model behaviors is more crucial. Our work thus highlights a novel and
significant application for internal causal analysis of language models.

Abstract: Deep learning models have driven significant progress in predicting protein
function and interactions at the protein level. While these advancements have
been invaluable for many biological applications such as enzyme engineering and
function annotation, a more detailed perspective is essential for understanding
protein functional mechanisms and evaluating the biological knowledge captured
by models. To address this demand, we introduce VenusX, the first large-scale
benchmark for fine-grained functional annotation and function-based protein
pairing at the residue, fragment, and domain levels. VenusX comprises three
major task categories across six types of annotations, including residue-level
binary classification, fragment-level multi-class classification, and pairwise
functional similarity scoring for identifying critical active sites, binding
sites, conserved sites, motifs, domains, and epitopes. The benchmark features
over 878,000 samples curated from major open-source databases such as InterPro,
BioLiP, and SAbDab. By providing mixed-family and cross-family splits at three
sequence identity thresholds, our benchmark enables a comprehensive assessment
of model performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.
For baseline evaluation, we assess a diverse set of popular and open-source
models, including pre-trained protein language models, sequence-structure
hybrids, structure-based methods, and alignment-based techniques. Their
performance is reported across all benchmark datasets and evaluation settings
using multiple metrics, offering a thorough comparison and a strong foundation
for future research. Code and data are publicly available at

Motivation: 神经网络通常被视为黑盒，难以理解其内部机制。本文挑战这一观点，提出神经网络的活动模式可以反映训练数据的规律，从而为可解释性提供新思路。

Method: 提出三种方法：离散序列分块（DSC）、群体平均（PA）和无监督分块发现（UCD），用于从高维神经活动中提取可解释的实体。

Result: 实验证明这些方法在不同规模的模型中均有效，提取的实体与具体或抽象概念有强相关性，并能通过人工诱导改变网络生成的概念。

Conclusion: 研究为神经网络的可解释性提供了新方向，结合认知原理和自然数据结构的分析，逐步将黑盒系统转化为可理解的系统。

Abstract: Neural networks are often black boxes, reflecting the significant challenge
of understanding their internal workings. We propose a different perspective
that challenges the prevailing view: rather than being inscrutable, neural
networks exhibit patterns in their raw population activity that mirror
regularities in the training data. We refer to this as the Reflection
Hypothesis and provide evidence for this phenomenon in both simple recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) and complex large language models (LLMs). Building on
this insight, we propose to leverage cognitively-inspired methods of chunking
to segment high-dimensional neural population dynamics into interpretable units
that reflect underlying concepts. We propose three methods to extract these
emerging entities, complementing each other based on label availability and
dimensionality. Discrete sequence chunking (DSC) creates a dictionary of
entities; population averaging (PA) extracts recurring entities that correspond
to known labels; and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD) can be used when labels
are absent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in extracting
entities across varying model sizes, ranging from inducing compositionality in
RNNs to uncovering recurring neural population states in large models with
diverse architectures, and illustrate their advantage over other methods.
Throughout, we observe a robust correspondence between the extracted entities
and concrete or abstract concepts. Artificially inducing the extracted entities
in neural populations effectively alters the network's generation of associated
concepts. Our work points to a new direction for interpretability, one that
harnesses both cognitive principles and the structure of naturalistic data to
reveal the hidden computations of complex learning systems, gradually
transforming them from black boxes into systems we can begin to understand.

Conclusion: RL训练是提升LLM-as-a-Judge扩展能力的关键，J1-7B为AI评估提供了更高效和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: The current focus of AI research is shifting from emphasizing model training
towards enhancing evaluation quality, a transition that is crucial for driving
further advancements in AI systems. Traditional evaluation methods typically
rely on reward models assigning scalar preference scores to outputs. Although
effective, such approaches lack interpretability, leaving users often uncertain
about why a reward model rates a particular response as high or low. The advent
of LLM-as-a-Judge provides a more scalable and interpretable method of
supervision, offering insights into the decision-making process. Moreover, with
the emergence of large reasoning models, which consume more tokens for deeper
thinking and answer refinement, scaling test-time computation in the
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm presents an avenue for further boosting performance and
providing more interpretability through reasoning traces. In this paper, we
introduce $\textbf{J1-7B}$, which is first supervised fine-tuned on
reflection-enhanced datasets collected via rejection-sampling and subsequently
trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with verifiable rewards. At inference
time, we apply Simple Test-Time Scaling (STTS) strategies for additional
performance improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that $\textbf{J1-7B}$
surpasses the previous state-of-the-art LLM-as-a-Judge by $ \textbf{4.8}$\% and
exhibits a $ \textbf{5.1}$\% stronger scaling trend under STTS. Additionally,
we present three key findings: (1) Existing LLM-as-a-Judge does not inherently
exhibit such scaling trend. (2) Model simply fine-tuned on reflection-enhanced
datasets continues to demonstrate similarly weak scaling behavior. (3)
Significant scaling trend emerges primarily during the RL phase, suggesting
that effective STTS capability is acquired predominantly through RL training.

Motivation: 注意力计算的二次时间复杂度限制了效率，因此需要优化其计算速度。

Method: 1. 利用Blackwell GPU的FP4 Tensor Cores加速注意力计算；2. 设计8-bit注意力机制用于训练任务。

Result: FP4注意力在RTX5090上实现5倍加速；8-bit注意力在微调任务中无损性能，但在预训练中收敛较慢。

Conclusion: 低比特注意力在推理和部分训练任务中高效可行，但预训练任务仍需优化。

Abstract: The efficiency of attention is important due to its quadratic time
complexity. We enhance the efficiency of attention through two key
contributions: First, we leverage the new FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell GPUs to
accelerate attention computation. Our implementation achieves 1038 TOPS on
RTX5090, which is a 5x speedup over the fastest FlashAttention on RTX5090.
Experiments show that our FP4 attention can accelerate inference of various
models in a plug-and-play way. Second, we pioneer low-bit attention to training
tasks. Existing low-bit attention works like FlashAttention3 and SageAttention
focus only on inference. However, the efficiency of training large models is
also important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied
to training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both
forward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention
achieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower
convergence in pretraining tasks. The code will be available at

Abstract: Fine-grained economic mapping through urban representation learning has
emerged as a crucial tool for evidence-based economic decisions. While existing
methods primarily rely on supervised or unsupervised approaches, they often
overlook semi-supervised learning in data-scarce scenarios and lack unified
multi-task frameworks for comprehensive sectoral economic analysis. To address
these gaps, we propose SemiGTX, an explainable semi-supervised graph learning
framework for sectoral economic mapping. The framework is designed with
dedicated fusion encoding modules for various geospatial data modalities,
seamlessly integrating them into a cohesive graph structure. It introduces a
semi-information loss function that combines spatial self-supervision with
locally masked supervised regression, enabling more informative and effective
region representations. Through multi-task learning, SemiGTX concurrently maps
GDP across primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors within a unified model.
Extensive experiments conducted in the Pearl River Delta region of China
demonstrate the model's superior performance compared to existing methods,
achieving R2 scores of 0.93, 0.96, and 0.94 for the primary, secondary and
tertiary sectors, respectively. Cross-regional experiments in Beijing and
Chengdu further illustrate its generality. Systematic analysis reveals how
different data modalities influence model predictions, enhancing explainability
while providing valuable insights for regional development planning. This
representation learning framework advances regional economic monitoring through
diverse urban data integration, providing a robust foundation for precise
economic forecasting.

Result: ELHSR性能显著优于基线模型，计算效率提升显著，且适用于闭源LLM。

Conclusion: ELHSR是一种高效、通用的奖励模型，可单独使用或与传统模型结合提升性能。

Abstract: High-quality reward models are crucial for unlocking the reasoning potential
of large language models (LLMs), with best-of-N voting demonstrating
significant performance gains. However, current reward models, which typically
operate on the textual output of LLMs, are computationally expensive and
parameter-heavy, limiting their real-world applications. We introduce the
Efficient Linear Hidden State Reward (ELHSR) model - a novel, highly
parameter-efficient approach that leverages the rich information embedded in
LLM hidden states to address these issues. ELHSR systematically outperform
baselines with less than 0.005% of the parameters of baselines, requiring only
a few samples for training. ELHSR also achieves orders-of-magnitude efficiency
improvement with significantly less time and fewer FLOPs per sample than
baseline reward models. Moreover, ELHSR exhibits robust performance even when
trained only on logits, extending its applicability to some closed-source LLMs.
In addition, ELHSR can also be combined with traditional reward models to
achieve additional performance gains.

Result: MINGLE在标准基准测试中显著减少遗忘，平均性能提升7-9%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MINGLE通过动态适应和约束设计，有效解决了持续模型合并的关键挑战，具有鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: Continual model merging integrates independently fine-tuned models
sequentially without access to original training data, providing a scalable and
efficient solution to continual learning. However, current methods still face
critical challenges, notably parameter interference among tasks and limited
adaptability to evolving test distributions. The former causes catastrophic
forgetting of integrated tasks, while the latter hinders effective adaptation
to new tasks. To address these, we propose MINGLE, a novel framework for
test-time continual model merging, which leverages test-time adaptation using a
small set of unlabeled test samples from the current task to dynamically guide
the merging process. MINGLE employs a mixture-of-experts architecture composed
of parameter-efficient, low-rank experts, enabling efficient adaptation and
improving robustness to distribution shifts. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, we propose Null-Space Constrained Gating, which restricts gating
updates to subspaces orthogonal to prior task representations. This suppresses
activations on old task inputs and preserves model behavior on past tasks. To
further balance stability and adaptability, we design an Adaptive Relaxation
Strategy, which dynamically adjusts the constraint strength based on
interference signals captured during test-time adaptation. Extensive
experiments on standard continual merging benchmarks demonstrate that MINGLE
achieves robust generalization, reduces forgetting significantly, and
consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by 7-9\% on average
across diverse task orders.

Conclusion: PEARL通过动态秩分配有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题，提升了持续学习的性能。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting has remained a critical challenge for deep neural
networks in Continual Learning (CL) as it undermines consolidated knowledge
when learning new tasks. Parameter efficient fine tuning CL techniques are
gaining traction for their effectiveness in addressing catastrophic forgetting
with a lightweight training schedule while avoiding degradation of consolidated
knowledge in pre-trained models. However, low rank adapters (LoRA) in these
approaches are highly sensitive to rank selection which can lead to sub-optimal
resource allocation and performance. To this end, we introduce PEARL, a
rehearsal-free CL framework that entails dynamic rank allocation for LoRA
components during CL training. Specifically, PEARL leverages reference task
weights and adaptively determines the rank of task-specific LoRA components
based on the current tasks' proximity to reference task weights in parameter
space. To demonstrate the versatility of PEARL, we evaluate it across three
vision architectures (ResNet, Separable Convolutional Network and Vision
Transformer) and a multitude of CL scenarios, and show that PEARL outperforms
all considered baselines by a large margin.

Abstract: Scaling RL for LLMs is computationally expensive, largely due to
multi-sampling for policy optimization and evaluation, making efficient data
selection crucial. Inspired by the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory,
we hypothesize LLMs learn best from data within their potential comprehension
zone. Addressing the limitation of conventional, computationally intensive
multi-sampling methods for data assessment, we introduce UFO-RL. This novel
framework uses a computationally efficient single-pass uncertainty estimation
to identify informative data instances, achieving up to 185x faster data
evaluation. UFO-RL leverages this metric to select data within the estimated
ZPD for training. Experiments show that training with just 10% of data selected
by UFO-RL yields performance comparable to or surpassing full-data training,
reducing overall training time by up to 16x while enhancing stability and
generalization. UFO-RL offers a practical and highly efficient strategy for
scaling RL fine-tuning of LLMs by focusing learning on valuable data.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with auxiliary tokens has emerged as
a promising strategy for enhancing model performance. In this work, we
introduce a lightweight method termed latent tokens; these are dummy tokens
that may be non-interpretable in natural language but steer the autoregressive
decoding process of a Transformer-based LLM via the attention mechanism. The
proposed latent tokens can be seamlessly integrated with a pre-trained
Transformer, trained in a parameter-efficient manner, and applied flexibly at
inference time, while adding minimal complexity overhead to the existing
infrastructure of standard Transformers. We propose several hypotheses about
the underlying mechanisms of latent tokens and design synthetic tasks
accordingly to verify them. Numerical results confirm that the proposed method
noticeably outperforms the baselines, particularly in the out-of-distribution
generalization scenarios, highlighting its potential in improving the
adaptability of LLMs.

*Ali Gholamzadeh,Noor Sajid*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出了一种半监督的条件流匹配方法，用于跨模态模型对齐，解决了现有方法需要大量配对数据或局限于特定领域的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态模型重用因内部表示对齐困难而受限，现有方法需要大量配对数据或局限于特定领域。

Method: 通过条件流匹配学习不同模态潜在空间之间的条件流，包括解决最优传输问题和利用标记样本进行高效对齐。

Result: 在MNIST、ImageNet等数据集上，该方法在标记数据稀缺（<20%）时与端到端训练模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨模态模型对齐提供了数据高效的解决方案，仅需少量监督。

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across modalities
such as language and vision. However, model reuse across distinct modalities
(e.g., text and vision) remains limited due to the difficulty of aligning
internal representations. Existing methods require extensive paired training
data or are constrained to specific domains. We introduce a semi-supervised
approach for model alignment via conditional flow matching. The conditional
flow between latent spaces of different modalities (e.g., text-to-image or
biological-to-artificial neuronal activity) can be learned in two settings:
($1$) solving a (balanced or unbalanced) optimal transport problem with an
inter-space bridge cost, and ($2$) performing memory-efficient alignment using
labelled exemplars. Despite being constrained by the original models' capacity,
our method--under both settings--matches downstream task performance of
end-to-end trained models on object recognition and image generation tasks
across MNIST, ImageNet, and \cite{majaj2015simple} datasets, particularly when
labelled training data is scarce ($<20\%$). Our method provides a
data-efficient solution for inter-modal model alignment with minimal
supervision.

*Sunghwan Kim,Dongjin Kang,Taeyoon Kwon,Hyungjoo Chae,Dongha Lee,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 本文探讨了如何构建可靠的奖励模型基准，强调减少选择与拒绝响应间的差异、多维度比较以及多样化模型来源的重要性，同时指出过度优化可能影响下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型基准与优化策略性能相关性较弱，无法准确评估奖励模型的真实能力。

Method: 通过奖励过度优化的视角，探索多种评估设计，分析奖励模型与人类偏好的对齐及其提供的学习信号动态。

Result: 发现构建可靠基准的三个关键点：减少选择与拒绝响应差异、多维度比较、多样化模型来源；同时指出过度优化可能降低下游性能相关性。

Conclusion: 设计基准时应将过度优化作为工具而非目标，以平衡评估与下游性能。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a crucial role in reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), aligning model behavior with human preferences. However,
existing benchmarks for reward models show a weak correlation with the
performance of optimized policies, suggesting that they fail to accurately
assess the true capabilities of RMs. To bridge this gap, we explore several
evaluation designs through the lens of reward overoptimization\textemdash a
phenomenon that captures both how well the reward model aligns with human
preferences and the dynamics of the learning signal it provides to the policy.
The results highlight three key findings on how to construct a reliable
benchmark: (i) it is important to minimize differences between chosen and
rejected responses beyond correctness, (ii) evaluating reward models requires
multiple comparisons across a wide range of chosen and rejected responses, and
(iii) given that reward models encounter responses with diverse
representations, responses should be sourced from a variety of models. However,
we also observe that a extremely high correlation with degree of
overoptimization leads to comparatively lower correlation with certain
downstream performance. Thus, when designing a benchmark, it is desirable to
use the degree of overoptimization as a useful tool, rather than the end goal.

*Zheng Wu,Pengzhou Cheng,Zongru Wu,Lingzhong Dong,Zhuosheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为GEM的新方法，用于检测GUI代理中的分布外（OOD）指令，通过拟合高斯混合模型来提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI代理在执行超出能力范围或违反环境约束的OOD指令时可能引发任务崩溃或安全威胁，传统OOD检测方法在此领域表现不佳。

Method: 基于GUI代理输入语义空间的聚类特性，提出GEM方法，通过拟合高斯混合模型分析输入嵌入距离以界定能力边界。

Result: 在八个数据集上测试，GEM方法平均准确率比最佳基线提升23.70%，并在九种不同骨干网络上验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: GEM方法有效提升了GUI代理中OOD指令的检测性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have recently emerged as an intriguing
paradigm for human-computer interaction, capable of automatically executing
user instructions to operate intelligent terminal devices. However, when
encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) instructions that violate environmental
constraints or exceed the current capabilities of agents, GUI agents may suffer
task breakdowns or even pose security threats. Therefore, effective OOD
detection for GUI agents is essential. Traditional OOD detection methods
perform suboptimally in this domain due to the complex embedding space and
evolving GUI environments. In this work, we observe that the in-distribution
input semantic space of GUI agents exhibits a clustering pattern with respect
to the distance from the centroid. Based on the finding, we propose GEM, a
novel method based on fitting a Gaussian mixture model over input embedding
distances extracted from the GUI Agent that reflect its capability boundary.
Evaluated on eight datasets spanning smartphones, computers, and web browsers,
our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.70\% over the
best-performing baseline. Analysis verifies the generalization ability of our
method through experiments on nine different backbones. The codes are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有免训练方法在幻觉缓解上表现不稳定且对超参数敏感，限制了实用性。

Method: DCLA通过聚合先前层的表示构建动态语义参考，并校正语义偏离层以增强层间一致性。

Result: 在MME和POPE等基准测试中，DCLA显著减少了幻觉，提升了模型的可靠性和性能。

Conclusion: DCLA是一种无需外部知识库或微调的实用方法，能有效缓解LVLMs的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
they remain susceptible to hallucinations-generating content that is
inconsistent with the input image. Existing training-free hallucination
mitigation methods often suffer from unstable performance and high sensitivity
to hyperparameter settings, limiting their practicality and broader adoption.
In this paper, we propose a novel decoding mechanism, Decoding with Inter-layer
Consistency via Layer Aggregation (DCLA), which requires no retraining,
fine-tuning, or access to external knowledge bases. Specifically, our approach
constructs a dynamic semantic reference by aggregating representations from
previous layers, and corrects semantically deviated layers to enforce
inter-layer consistency. The method allows DCLA to robustly mitigate
hallucinations across multiple LVLMs. Experiments on hallucination benchmarks
such as MME and POPE demonstrate that DCLA effectively reduces hallucinations
while enhancing the reliability and performance of LVLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: LoRA在微调大语言模型时效率高，但其在训练时攻击下的安全性未被充分研究。本文分析LoRA对数据投毒和后门攻击的鲁棒性，发现其对后门攻击更鲁棒，但对非目标数据投毒更脆弱。

Motivation: 研究LoRA在训练时攻击下的安全性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出分析框架，结合神经正切核和信息论，建模LoRA训练动态。

Result: LoRA对后门攻击更鲁棒，但对非目标数据投毒更脆弱。

Conclusion: LoRA的低秩结构影响其安全性，需在应用中权衡效率与安全。

Abstract: Low rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) thanks to its superb efficiency gains
over previous methods. While extensive studies have examined the performance
and structural properties of LoRA, its behavior upon training-time attacks
remain underexplored, posing significant security risks. In this paper, we
theoretically investigate the security implications of LoRA's low-rank
structure during fine-tuning, in the context of its robustness against data
poisoning and backdoor attacks. We propose an analytical framework that models
LoRA's training dynamics, employs the neural tangent kernel to simplify the
analysis of the training process, and applies information theory to establish
connections between LoRA's low rank structure and its vulnerability against
training-time attacks. Our analysis indicates that LoRA exhibits better
robustness to backdoor attacks than full fine-tuning, while becomes more
vulnerable to untargeted data poisoning due to its over-simplified information
geometry. Extensive experimental evaluations have corroborated our theoretical
findings.

TLDR: STAR是一种无需训练、即插即用的视觉令牌剪枝框架，通过分阶段注意力引导减少计算开销，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单阶段令牌剪枝方法因局部视角导致性能下降，尤其是高剪枝率下。

Method: STAR分两阶段剪枝：早期基于视觉自注意力剪枝冗余低层特征，后期基于跨模态注意力剪枝任务无关令牌。

Result: 实验表明STAR显著加速计算，同时保持甚至提升性能。

Conclusion: STAR提供了一种全局视角的令牌剪枝方法，高效且性能优越。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) leverage rich visual token
representations to achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks, these tokens
also introduce significant computational overhead during inference. Existing
training-free token pruning methods typically adopt a single-stage strategy,
focusing either on visual self-attention or visual-textual cross-attention.
However, such localized perspectives often overlook the broader information
flow across the model, leading to substantial performance degradation,
especially under high pruning ratios. In this work, we propose STAR (Stage-wise
Attention-guided token Reduction), a training-free, plug-and-play framework
that approaches token pruning from a global perspective. Instead of pruning at
a single point, STAR performs attention-guided reduction in two complementary
stages: an early-stage pruning based on visual self-attention to remove
redundant low-level features, and a later-stage pruning guided by cross-modal
attention to discard task-irrelevant tokens. This holistic approach allows STAR
to significantly reduce computational cost while better preserving
task-critical information. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLM
architectures and benchmarks show that STAR achieves strong acceleration while
maintaining comparable, and in some cases even improved performance.

Conclusion: Observe-R1框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型的推理能力，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in improving the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the specific challenges of
adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain relatively unexplored. In
this work, we present Observe-R1, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We draw
inspirations from human learning progression--from simple to complex and easy
to difficult, and propose a gradual learning paradigm for MLLMs. To this end,
we construct the NeuraLadder dataset, which is organized and sampled according
to the difficulty and complexity of data samples for RL training. To tackle
multimodal tasks, we introduce a multimodal format constraint that encourages
careful observation of images, resulting in enhanced visual abilities and
clearer and more structured responses. Additionally, we implement a bonus
reward system that favors concise, correct answers within a length constraint,
alongside a dynamic weighting mechanism that prioritizes uncertain and
medium-difficulty problems, ensuring that more informative samples have a
greater impact on training. Our experiments with the Qwen2.5-VL-3B and
Qwen2.5-VL-7B models on 20k samples from the NeuraLadder dataset show that
Observe-R1 outperforms a series of larger reasoning models on both reasoning
and general benchmarks, achieving superior clarity and conciseness in reasoning
chains. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our strategies,
highlighting the robustness and generalization of our approach. The dataset and
code will be released at https://github.com/zrguo/Observe-R1.

Result: 理论分析和APPS数据集实验证明该方法优于基线，且在编码和网络安全领域的前沿模型中仍有效。

Conclusion: 利用模型不一致性的方法具有广泛适用性，未来模型仍可能受益。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive abilities in numerous
domains, but exhibit inconsistent performance in response to minor input
changes. Rather than view this as a drawback, in this paper we introduce a
novel method for leveraging models' inconsistency to boost Pass@k performance.
Specifically, we present a "Variator" agent that generates k variants of a
given task and submits one candidate solution for each one. Our variant
generation approach is applicable to a wide range of domains as it is task
agnostic and compatible with free-form inputs. We demonstrate the efficacy of
our agent theoretically using a probabilistic model of the inconsistency
effect, and show empirically that it outperforms the baseline on the APPS
dataset. Furthermore, we establish that inconsistency persists even in frontier
reasoning models across coding and cybersecurity domains, suggesting our method
is likely to remain relevant for future model generations.

Result: 联合嵌入方法在无关特征影响较大时更优，因其对齐条件较弱。

Conclusion: 研究结果解释了两种范式的权衡，并验证了联合嵌入方法在现实数据集上的成功。

Abstract: Reconstruction and joint embedding have emerged as two leading paradigms in
Self Supervised Learning (SSL). Reconstruction methods focus on recovering the
original sample from a different view in input space. On the other hand, joint
embedding methods align the representations of different views in latent space.
Both approaches offer compelling advantages, yet practitioners lack clear
guidelines for choosing between them. In this work, we unveil the core
mechanisms that distinguish each paradigm. By leveraging closed form solutions
for both approaches, we precisely characterize how the view generation process,
e.g. data augmentation, impacts the learned representations. We then
demonstrate that, unlike supervised learning, both SSL paradigms require a
minimal alignment between augmentations and irrelevant features to achieve
asymptotic optimality with increasing sample size. Our findings indicate that
in scenarios where these irrelevant features have a large magnitude, joint
embedding methods are preferable because they impose a strictly weaker
alignment condition compared to reconstruction based methods. These results not
only clarify the trade offs between the two paradigms but also substantiate the
empirical success of joint embedding approaches on real world challenging
datasets.

TLDR: Fractured Sampling是一种推理时策略，通过截断推理轨迹和调整采样维度，显著减少token成本，同时保持推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought（CoT）及其扩展方法在延迟敏感场景中因高token成本而难以部署的问题。

Method: 提出Fractured Sampling，通过三个正交维度（推理轨迹数量、每个轨迹的最终解数量、截断深度）在完整CoT和仅解采样之间插值。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试和多种模型规模上，Fractured Sampling实现了更优的准确性-成本权衡，并展示了对数线性扩展增益。

Conclusion: Fractured Sampling为更高效和可扩展的LLM推理提供了计算分配策略。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling techniques have significantly bolstered the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by harnessing additional
computational effort at inference without retraining. Similarly,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its extension, Long CoT, improve accuracy
by generating rich intermediate reasoning trajectories, but these approaches
incur substantial token costs that impede their deployment in latency-sensitive
settings. In this work, we first show that truncated CoT, which stops reasoning
before completion and directly generates the final answer, often matches full
CoT sampling while using dramatically fewer tokens. Building on this insight,
we introduce Fractured Sampling, a unified inference-time strategy that
interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three orthogonal
axes: (1) the number of reasoning trajectories, (2) the number of final
solutions per trajectory, and (3) the depth at which reasoning traces are
truncated. Through extensive experiments on five diverse reasoning benchmarks
and several model scales, we demonstrate that Fractured Sampling consistently
achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, yielding steep log-linear scaling
gains in Pass@k versus token budget. Our analysis reveals how to allocate
computation across these dimensions to maximize performance, paving the way for
more efficient and scalable LLM reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来深度学习模型需要持续学习，但现有方法如重放技术成本高且未充分利用多任务微调技术。

Method: 结合低秩适应、巩固性重放和顺序合并，提出了一种协同策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法减少55%的重放样本需求，并显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 提出的工具集在持续学习中表现出高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Future deep learning models will be distinguished by systems that perpetually
learn through interaction, imagination, and cooperation, blurring the line
between training and inference. This makes continual learning a critical
challenge, as methods that efficiently maximize bidirectional transfer across
learning trajectories will be essential. Replay is on track to play a
foundational role in continual learning, allowing models to directly reconcile
new information with past knowledge. In practice, however, replay is quite
unscalable, doubling the cost of continual learning when applied naively.
Moreover, the continual learning literature has not fully synchronized with the
multi-task fine-tuning literature, having not fully integrated highly scalable
techniques like model merging and low rank adaptation into a replay-enabled
toolset that can produce a unified model in the face of many sequential tasks.
In this paper, we begin by applying and analyzing low rank adaptation in a
continual learning setting. Next, we introduce consolidation, a phasic approach
to replay which leads to up to 55\% less replay samples being needed for a
given performance target. Then, we propose sequential merging, an offshoot of
task arithmetic which is tailored to the continual learning setting and is
shown to work well in combination with replay. Finally, we demonstrate that the
developed strategies can operate synergistically, resulting in a highly
scalable toolset that outperforms standalone variants.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效分析数据增强的影响，并识别其对模型的不同影响模式。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为定量分析数据增强对神经网络的影响提供了新工具。

Abstract: Neural networks have become increasingly popular in the last few years as an
effective tool for the task of image classification due to the impressive
performance they have achieved on this task. In image classification tasks, it
is common to use data augmentation strategies to increase the robustness of
trained networks to changes in the input images and to avoid overfitting.
Although data augmentation is a widely adopted technique, the literature lacks
a body of research analyzing the effects data augmentation methods have on the
patterns learned by neural network models working on complex datasets. The
primary objective of this work is to propose a methodology and set of metrics
that may allow a quantitative approach to analyzing the effects of data
augmentation in convolutional networks applied to image classification. An
important tool used in the proposed approach lies in the concept of class
activation maps for said models, which allow us to identify and measure the
importance these models assign to each individual pixel in an image when
executing the classification task. From these maps, we may then extract metrics
over the similarities and differences between maps generated by these models
trained on a given dataset with different data augmentation strategies.
Experiments made using this methodology suggest that the effects of these data
augmentation techniques not only can be analyzed in this way but also allow us
to identify different impact profiles over the trained models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习的决策机制不透明，可能导致高风险领域中的严重后果，因此需要一种方法增强其决策的可信度。

Method: ToT算法通过生成两个额外的预测，结合原始预测，判断模型是否应提供答案。

Result: 该方法通过模拟人脑对冲突信息的敏感性，提升了模型在不确定情况下的决策可靠性。

Conclusion: ToT算法为深度学习在高风险领域的应用提供了一种潜在的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) can automatically construct intelligent agents, deep
neural networks (alternatively, DL models), that can outperform humans in
certain tasks. However, the operating principles of DL remain poorly
understood, making its decisions incomprehensible. As a result, it poses a
great risk to deploy DL in high-stakes domains in which mistakes or errors may
lead to critical consequences. Here, we aim to develop an algorithm that can
help DL models make more robust decisions by allowing them to abstain from
answering when they are uncertain. Our algorithm, named `Two out of Three
(ToT)', is inspired by the sensitivity of the human brain to conflicting
information. ToT creates two alternative predictions in addition to the
original model prediction and uses the alternative predictions to decide
whether it should provide an answer or not.

Motivation: 长上下文窗口部署LLMs时，KV缓存大小随上下文长度线性增长，现有压缩方法存在精度损失或效率瓶颈。

Method: FreeKV结合算法（推测性检索和细粒度校正）与系统优化（混合KV布局和双缓冲流式召回），提升KV检索效率。

Result: FreeKV在多种场景和模型中实现接近无损的准确性，速度比现有最优KV检索方法快13倍。

Conclusion: FreeKV通过协同优化算法和系统设计，有效解决了长上下文部署中的KV缓存问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding
context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long
contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache
whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression
methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur
considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant
efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization
framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the
algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV
selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with
fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs
hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data
transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve
efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy
across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup
compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

Conclusion: 对抗性学习可转化为跨域迁移的正则化工具，提升模型适应性。

Abstract: Transfer learning across domains with distribution shift remains a
fundamental challenge in building robust and adaptable machine learning
systems. While adversarial perturbations are traditionally viewed as threats
that expose model vulnerabilities, recent studies suggest that they can also
serve as constructive tools for data augmentation. In this work, we
systematically investigate the role of adversarial data augmentation (ADA) in
enhancing both robustness and adaptivity in transfer learning settings. We
analyze how adversarial examples, when used strategically during training,
improve domain generalization by enriching decision boundaries and reducing
overfitting to source-domain-specific features. We further propose a unified
framework that integrates ADA with consistency regularization and
domain-invariant representation learning. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets -- including VisDA, DomainNet, and Office-Home --
demonstrate that our method consistently improves target-domain performance
under both unsupervised and few-shot domain adaptation settings. Our results
highlight a constructive perspective of adversarial learning, transforming
perturbation from a destructive attack into a regularizing force for
cross-domain transferability.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental problem in domains such as healthcare,
manufacturing, and cybersecurity. This thesis proposes new unsupervised methods
for anomaly detection in both structured and streaming data settings. In the
first part, we focus on structure-based anomaly detection, where normal data
follows low-dimensional manifolds while anomalies deviate from them. We
introduce Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), which embeds data into a
high-dimensional preference space via manifold fitting, and isolates outliers
using two variants: Voronoi-iForest, based on geometric distances, and
RuzHash-iForest, leveraging Locality Sensitive Hashing for scalability. We also
propose Sliding-PIF, which captures local manifold information for streaming
scenarios. Our methods outperform existing techniques on synthetic and real
datasets. We extend this to structure-based clustering with MultiLink, a novel
method for recovering multiple geometric model families in noisy data.
MultiLink merges clusters via a model-aware linkage strategy, enabling robust
multi-class structure recovery. It offers key advantages over existing
approaches, such as speed, reduced sensitivity to thresholds, and improved
robustness to poor initial sampling. The second part of the thesis addresses
online anomaly detection in evolving data streams. We propose Online Isolation
Forest (Online-iForest), which uses adaptive, multi-resolution histograms and
dynamically updates tree structures to track changes over time. It avoids
retraining while achieving accuracy comparable to offline models, with superior
efficiency for real-time applications. Finally, we tackle anomaly detection in
cybersecurity via open-set recognition for malware classification. We enhance a
Gradient Boosting classifier with MaxLogit to detect unseen malware families, a
method now integrated into Cleafy's production system.

Conclusion: LatentSeek是一种轻量、可扩展且高效的解决方案，展示了潜在空间测试时扩展的潜力。

Abstract: Reasoning ability, a core component of human intelligence, continues to pose
a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) in the pursuit of AGI.
Although model performance has improved under the training scaling law,
significant challenges remain, particularly with respect to training
algorithms, such as catastrophic forgetting, and the limited availability of
novel training data. As an alternative, test-time scaling enhances reasoning
performance by increasing test-time computation without parameter updating.
Unlike prior methods in this paradigm focused on token space, we propose
leveraging latent space for more effective reasoning and better adherence to
the test-time scaling law. We introduce LatentSeek, a novel framework that
enhances LLM reasoning through Test-Time Instance-level Adaptation (TTIA)
within the model's latent space. Specifically, LatentSeek leverages policy
gradient to iteratively update latent representations, guided by self-generated
reward signals. LatentSeek is evaluated on a range of reasoning benchmarks,
including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, across multiple LLM architectures.
Results show that LatentSeek consistently outperforms strong baselines, such as
Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning-based methods. Furthermore, our
analysis demonstrates that LatentSeek is highly efficient, typically converging
within a few iterations for problems of average complexity, while also
benefiting from additional iterations, thereby highlighting the potential of
test-time scaling in the latent space. These findings position LatentSeek as a
lightweight, scalable, and effective solution for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

TLDR: 论文探讨了正则化方法对神经网络训练的影响，发现MDL原则能更好地选择完美解而非近似解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究标准正则化方法（如L1、L2或无正则化）在训练神经网络时可能导致模型远离完美解的问题。

Method: 通过对比标准正则化与基于最小描述长度（MDL）原则的正则化方法，验证MDL在训练中的效果。

Result: MDL能有效选择完美解，不受优化算法影响，而标准正则化方法则无法实现这一点。

Conclusion: MDL提供了更合适的归纳偏置，能有效对抗过拟合并促进泛化。

Abstract: State-of-the-art neural networks can be trained to become remarkable
solutions to many problems. But while these architectures can express symbolic,
perfect solutions, trained models often arrive at approximations instead. We
show that the choice of regularization method plays a crucial role: when
trained on formal languages with standard regularization ($L_1$, $L_2$, or
none), expressive architectures not only fail to converge to correct solutions
but are actively pushed away from perfect initializations. In contrast,
applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to balance model
complexity with data fit provides a theoretically grounded regularization
method. Using MDL, perfect solutions are selected over approximations,
independently of the optimization algorithm. We propose that unlike existing
regularization techniques, MDL introduces the appropriate inductive bias to
effectively counteract overfitting and promote generalization.

Result: 实验表明TinyAlign显著降低训练损失、加速收敛，仅需40%微调数据即可达到基线性能。

Conclusion: TinyAlign为开发更强大的轻量级VLM提供了实用方法，并提供了理解对齐瓶颈的新理论视角。

Abstract: Lightweight Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are indispensable for
resource-constrained applications. The prevailing approach to aligning vision
and language models involves freezing both the vision encoder and the language
model while training small connector modules. However, this strategy heavily
depends on the intrinsic capabilities of the language model, which can be
suboptimal for lightweight models with limited representational capacity. In
this work, we investigate this alignment bottleneck through the lens of mutual
information, demonstrating that the constrained capacity of the language model
inherently limits the Effective Mutual Information (EMI) between multimodal
inputs and outputs, thereby compromising alignment quality. To address this
challenge, we propose TinyAlign, a novel framework inspired by
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which strategically retrieves relevant context
from a memory bank to enrich multimodal inputs and enhance their alignment.
Extensive empirical evaluations reveal that TinyAlign significantly reduces
training loss, accelerates convergence, and enhances task performance.
Remarkably, it allows models to achieve baseline-level performance with only
40\% of the fine-tuning data, highlighting exceptional data efficiency. Our
work thus offers a practical pathway for developing more capable lightweight
VLMs while introducing a fresh theoretical lens to better understand and
address alignment bottlenecks in constrained multimodal systems.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模的指数增长，GPU内存成为下游任务适应的瓶颈，需解决权重、梯度和优化器状态的内存占用问题。

Method: 结合零阶优化（通过扰动权重估计梯度）和模型量化（如bfloat16转int4），提出QZO方法，避免量化权重与连续梯度间的精度问题。

Result: QZO将4位LLM的总内存成本降低18倍以上，可在单块24GB GPU上微调Llama-2-13B和Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large。

Conclusion: QZO为内存受限场景下的模型微调提供了高效解决方案，且与现有量化方法兼容。

Abstract: As the size of large language models grows exponentially, GPU memory has
become a bottleneck for adapting these models to downstream tasks. In this
paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing
memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a
unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states
using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing
weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize
memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from
bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to
quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete
weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization
and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized
Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a novel approach that perturbs the continuous
quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative
clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based
and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to
full-parameter fine-tuning in bfloat16, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by
more than 18$\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large within a single 24GB GPU.

Conclusion: CALM-PDE为高效解决任意离散化PDE问题提供了新思路，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Solving time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using a densely
discretized spatial domain is a fundamental problem in various scientific and
engineering disciplines, including modeling climate phenomena and fluid
dynamics. However, performing these computations directly in the physical space
often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several
neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent
space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity,
they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly
sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast,
convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but
are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we
propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized
PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous
convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an
epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution
operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and
irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or
outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements
in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.

Result: 在数学推理任务中，AnytimeReasoner在所有预算下均优于GRPO，提升了训练和令牌效率。

Conclusion: AnytimeReasoner通过优化动态推理性能，显著提升了LLM的效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities
of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically employ
reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end
of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance
under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to
optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency
and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To
achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled
token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the
optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces
verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more
effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking
and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward.
Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget
Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency
of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results
in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions,
enhancing both training and token efficiency.

Conclusion: 结论是CPO能够有效稳定非平稳环境中的RFT，特别是在医疗领域，同时公开了代码和数据。

Abstract: This paper uncovers a critical yet overlooked phenomenon in multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs): detrimental concept drift within chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning during non-stationary reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), where
reasoning token distributions evolve unpredictably, thereby introducing
significant biases in final predictions. To address this, we are pioneers in
establishing the theoretical bridge between concept drift theory and RFT
processes by formalizing CoT's autoregressive token streams as non-stationary
distributions undergoing arbitrary temporal shifts. Leveraging this framework,
we propose a novel counterfact-aware RFT that systematically decouples
beneficial distribution adaptation from harmful concept drift through concept
graph-empowered LLM experts generating counterfactual reasoning trajectories.
Our solution, Counterfactual Preference Optimization (CPO), enables stable RFT
in non-stationary environments, particularly within the medical domain, through
custom-tuning of counterfactual-aware preference alignment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our superior performance of robustness, generalization
and coordination within RFT. Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset
CXR-CounterFact (CCF), comprising 320,416 meticulously curated counterfactual
reasoning trajectories derived from MIMIC-CXR. Our code and data are public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据常具有未知或近似对称性，现有等变网络需预先固定变换群（如连续旋转群SO(2)），导致性能下降。

Method: RECON利用类-姿态分解和数据驱动归一化，将任意参考系对齐到共同自然姿态，生成可比较的对称性描述符。

Result: 在2D图像基准测试中有效发现对称性，并首次扩展到3D变换群。

Conclusion: RECON为更灵活的等变建模提供了新途径。

Abstract: Real-world data often exhibits unknown or approximate symmetries, yet
existing equivariant networks must commit to a fixed transformation group prior
to training, e.g., continuous $SO(2)$ rotations. This mismatch degrades
performance when the actual data symmetries differ from those in the
transformation group. We introduce RECON, a framework to discover each input's
intrinsic symmetry distribution from unlabeled data. RECON leverages class-pose
decompositions and applies a data-driven normalization to align arbitrary
reference frames into a common natural pose, yielding directly comparable and
interpretable symmetry descriptors. We demonstrate effective symmetry discovery
on 2D image benchmarks and -- for the first time -- extend it to 3D
transformation groups, paving the way towards more flexible equivariant
modeling.

Conclusion: MeanFlow大幅缩小了单步与多步模型的差距，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a principled and effective framework for one-step generative
modeling. We introduce the notion of average velocity to characterize flow
fields, in contrast to instantaneous velocity modeled by Flow Matching methods.
A well-defined identity between average and instantaneous velocities is derived
and used to guide neural network training. Our method, termed the MeanFlow
model, is self-contained and requires no pre-training, distillation, or
curriculum learning. MeanFlow demonstrates strong empirical performance: it
achieves an FID of 3.43 with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet
256x256 trained from scratch, significantly outperforming previous
state-of-the-art one-step diffusion/flow models. Our study substantially
narrows the gap between one-step diffusion/flow models and their multi-step
predecessors, and we hope it will motivate future research to revisit the
foundations of these powerful models.
