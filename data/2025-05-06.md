### [1] [Unlearning Sensitive Information in Multimodal LLMs: Benchmark and Attack-Defense Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01456)
*Vaidehi Patil,Yi-Lin Sung,Peter Hase,Jie Peng,Tianlong Chen,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种多模态遗忘基准UnLOK-VQA，用于评估从多模态大语言模型中删除敏感信息的方法，并展示了多模态攻击的优越性和规模对模型安全性的积极影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型可能无意中学习敏感信息，而现有遗忘研究主要集中在文本领域，多模态遗忘尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入UnLOK-VQA基准和攻防框架，扩展视觉问答数据集，评估六种防御目标对抗七种攻击方法。

Result: 多模态攻击优于纯文本或图像攻击，最有效的防御方法是从内部模型状态中移除答案信息，且更大模型表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UnLOK-VQA为多模态遗忘研究提供了严格基准，表明模型规模有助于提升安全性。

Abstract: LLMs trained on massive datasets may inadvertently acquire sensitive
information such as personal details and potentially harmful content. This risk
is further heightened in multimodal LLMs as they integrate information from
multiple modalities (image and text). Adversaries can exploit this knowledge
through multimodal prompts to extract sensitive details. Evaluating how
effectively MLLMs can forget such information (targeted unlearning)
necessitates the creation of high-quality, well-annotated image-text pairs.
While prior work on unlearning has focused on text, multimodal unlearning
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce a multimodal
unlearning benchmark, UnLOK-VQA (Unlearning Outside Knowledge VQA), as well as
an attack-and-defense framework to evaluate methods for deleting specific
multimodal knowledge from MLLMs. We extend a visual question-answering dataset
using an automated pipeline that generates varying-proximity samples for
testing generalization and specificity, followed by manual filtering for
maintaining high quality. We then evaluate six defense objectives against seven
attacks (four whitebox, three blackbox), including a novel whitebox method
leveraging interpretability of hidden states. Our results show multimodal
attacks outperform text- or image-only ones, and that the most effective
defense removes answer information from internal model states. Additionally,
larger models exhibit greater post-editing robustness, suggesting that scale
enhances safety. UnLOK-VQA provides a rigorous benchmark for advancing
unlearning in MLLMs.

### [2] [MoxE: Mixture of xLSTM Experts with Entropy-Aware Routing for Efficient Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01459)
*Abdoul Majid O. Thiombiano,Brahim Hnich,Ali Ben Mrad,Mohamed Wiem Mkaouer*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: MoxE结合xLSTM和MoE框架，通过熵感知路由机制和辅助损失函数，显著提升大型语言模型的可扩展性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在可扩展性和效率方面的关键挑战。

Method: 结合xLSTM和MoE框架，引入熵感知路由机制和辅助损失函数。

Result: 显著提升效率和性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoxE在可扩展LLM架构中取得了重要进展。

Abstract: This paper introduces MoxE, a novel architecture that synergistically
combines the Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) with the Mixture of
Experts (MoE) framework to address critical scalability and efficiency
challenges in large language models (LLMs). The proposed method effectively
leverages xLSTM's innovative memory structures while strategically introducing
sparsity through MoE to substantially reduce computational overhead. At the
heart of our approach is a novel entropy-based routing mechanism, designed to
dynamically route tokens to specialized experts, thereby ensuring efficient and
balanced resource utilization. This entropy awareness enables the architecture
to effectively manage both rare and common tokens, with mLSTM blocks being
favored to handle rare tokens. To further enhance generalization, we introduce
a suite of auxiliary losses, including entropy-based and group-wise balancing
losses, ensuring robust performance and efficient training. Theoretical
analysis and empirical evaluations rigorously demonstrate that MoxE achieves
significant efficiency gains and enhanced effectiveness compared to existing
approaches, marking a notable advancement in scalable LLM architectures.

### [3] [SymPlanner: Deliberate Planning in Language Models with Symbolic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01479)
*Siheng Xiong,Jieyu Zhou,Zhangding Liu,Yusen Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: SymPlanner是一个结合语言模型与符号环境的新框架，通过迭代校正和对比排序提升多步规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在多步规划任务中缺乏外部约束和连贯性的问题。

Method: 结合符号环境作为显式世界模型，使用迭代校正和对比排序优化规划过程。

Result: 在PlanBench上表现优于纯自然语言基线，生成更连贯、多样且可验证的计划。

Conclusion: SymPlanner通过符号环境增强了语言模型的规划能力，为复杂任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Planning remains a core challenge for language models (LMs), particularly in
domains that require coherent multi-step action sequences grounded in external
constraints. We introduce SymPlanner, a novel framework that equips LMs with
structured planning capabilities by interfacing them with a symbolic
environment that serves as an explicit world model. Rather than relying purely
on natural language reasoning, SymPlanner grounds the planning process in a
symbolic state space, where a policy model proposes actions and a symbolic
environment deterministically executes and verifies their effects. To enhance
exploration and improve robustness, we introduce Iterative Correction (IC),
which refines previously proposed actions by leveraging feedback from the
symbolic environment to eliminate invalid decisions and guide the model toward
valid alternatives. Additionally, Contrastive Ranking (CR) enables fine-grained
comparison of candidate plans by evaluating them jointly. We evaluate
SymPlanner on PlanBench, demonstrating that it produces more coherent, diverse,
and verifiable plans than pure natural language baselines.

### [4] [On the effectiveness of Large Language Models in the mechanical design domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01559)
*Daniele Grandi,Fabian Riquelme*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究探讨大型语言模型在机械工程领域的性能，通过ABC数据集的无监督任务评估模型表现，发现特定失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型在机械工程领域的性能表现。

Method: 利用ABC数据集的语义数据，开发两个无监督任务（二元句子对分类和零样本分类），并通过调整学习率、dropout值、序列长度和添加多头注意力层优化模型。

Result: 二元句子对分类任务准确率为0.62，零样本分类任务准确率为0.386，优于基线。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了该领域语言学习的特定失败模式。

Abstract: In this work, we seek to understand the performance of large language models
in the mechanical engineering domain. We leverage the semantic data found in
the ABC dataset, specifically the assembly names that designers assigned to the
overall assemblies, and the individual semantic part names that were assigned
to each part. After pre-processing the data we developed two unsupervised tasks
to evaluate how different model architectures perform on domain-specific data:
a binary sentence-pair classification task and a zero-shot classification task.
We achieved a 0.62 accuracy for the binary sentence-pair classification task
with a fine-tuned model that focuses on fighting over-fitting: 1) modifying
learning rates, 2) dropout values, 3) Sequence Length, and 4) adding a
multi-head attention layer. Our model on the zero-shot classification task
outperforms the baselines by a wide margin, and achieves a top-1 classification
accuracy of 0.386. The results shed some light on the specific failure modes
that arise when learning from language in this domain.

### [5] [AI agents may be worth the hype but not the resources (yet): An initial exploration of machine translation quality and costs in three language pairs in the legal and news domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01560)
*Vicent Briva Iglesias,Gokhan Dogru*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文比较了五种机器翻译范式，发现传统NMT在自动评估中表现最佳，而增强推理的LLM在人工评估中更优，但多智能体工作流成本高昂。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM和多智能体编排在机器翻译中的实际效果，明确其相对于传统NMT的优势和不足。

Method: 对五种范式（NMT、通用LLM、增强推理LLM、两种多智能体工作流）进行自动和人工评估，涵盖三种语言对。

Result: 自动评估中NMT表现最佳，人工评估中增强推理LLM更优；多智能体工作流成本显著更高。

Conclusion: 建议多维、成本感知的评估方法，并探索更高效的协调策略和混合流程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent orchestration are touted as the
next leap in machine translation (MT), but their benefits relative to
conventional neural MT (NMT) remain unclear. This paper offers an empirical
reality check. We benchmark five paradigms, Google Translate (strong NMT
baseline), GPT-4o (general-purpose LLM), o1-preview (reasoning-enhanced LLM),
and two GPT-4o-powered agentic workflows (sequential three-stage and iterative
refinement), on test data drawn from a legal contract and news prose in three
English-source pairs: Spanish, Catalan and Turkish. Automatic evaluation is
performed with COMET, BLEU, chrF2 and TER; human evaluation is conducted with
expert ratings of adequacy and fluency; efficiency with total input-plus-output
token counts mapped to April 2025 pricing.
  Automatic scores still favour the mature NMT system, which ranks first in
seven of twelve metric-language combinations; o1-preview ties or places second
in most remaining cases, while both multi-agent workflows trail. Human
evaluation reverses part of this narrative: o1-preview produces the most
adequate and fluent output in five of six comparisons, and the iterative agent
edges ahead once, indicating that reasoning layers capture semantic nuance
undervalued by surface metrics. Yet these qualitative gains carry steep costs.
The sequential agent consumes roughly five times, and the iterative agent
fifteen times, the tokens used by NMT or single-pass LLMs.
  We advocate multidimensional, cost-aware evaluation protocols and highlight
research directions that could tip the balance: leaner coordination strategies,
selective agent activation, and hybrid pipelines combining single-pass LLMs
with targeted agent intervention.

### [6] [PIPA: A Unified Evaluation Protocol for Diagnosing Interactive Planning Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01592)
*Takyoung Kim,Janvijay Singh,Shuhaib Mehri,Emre Can Acikgoz,Sagnik Mukherjee,Nimet Beyza Bozdag,Sumuk Shashidhar,Gokhan Tur,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文提出PIPA，一种基于POMDP范式的统一评估协议，用于全面评估任务规划代理的性能，强调用户满意度不仅取决于任务完成结果，还涉及代理的中间行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要基于任务完成情况评估代理性能，而忽略了用户满意度与代理整个行为过程的关系。

Method: 提出PIPA协议，将交互式任务规划代理的行为过程建模为POMDP，并通过原子评估标准进行综合评估。

Result: 分析表明，代理在不同行为阶段表现各异，用户满意度受结果和中间行为共同影响。

Conclusion: PIPA为代理性能评估提供了更全面的视角，未来可探索多代理系统和用户模拟器的局限性。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
instruction-following and context-understanding lead to the era of agents with
numerous applications. Among these, task planning agents have become especially
prominent in realistic scenarios involving complex internal pipelines, such as
context understanding, tool management, and response generation. However,
existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate agent performance based on task
completion as a proxy for overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that merely
improving task completion is misaligned with maximizing user satisfaction, as
users interact with the entire agentic process and not only the end result. To
address this gap, we propose PIPA, a unified evaluation protocol that
conceptualizes the behavioral process of interactive task planning agents
within a partially observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) paradigm. The
proposed protocol offers a comprehensive assessment of agent performance
through a set of atomic evaluation criteria, allowing researchers and
practitioners to diagnose specific strengths and weaknesses within the agent's
decision-making pipeline. Our analyses show that agents excel in different
behavioral stages, with user satisfaction shaped by both outcomes and
intermediate behaviors. We also highlight future directions, including systems
that leverage multiple agents and the limitations of user simulators in task
planning.

*Liaoyaqi Wang,Zhengping Jiang,Anqi Liu,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种用于细粒度概率估计的先进模型，解决了LLM在不确定或部分信息下概率预测不准的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在不确定或部分信息下的概率预测存在偏差和粗糙问题，缺乏可靠的不确定性估计方法。

Method: 结合人工和合成数据创建与评估，扩展到更大模型，改进监督方式，提出精确概率估计模型。

Result: 在依赖条件概率估计的任务中，该方法显著优于现有微调和提示方法。

Conclusion: 通过改进数据、模型和监督，实现了更准确和细粒度的概率估计。

Abstract: We present a state-of-the-art model for fine-grained probability estimation
of propositions conditioned on context. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities,
particularly on well-defined tasks with complete information. However, LLMs
continue to struggle with making accurate and well-calibrated probabilistic
predictions under uncertainty or partial information. While incorporating
uncertainty into model predictions often boosts performance, obtaining reliable
estimates of that uncertainty remains understudied. In particular, LLM
probability estimates tend to be coarse and biased towards more frequent
numbers. Through a combination of human and synthetic data creation and
assessment, scaling to larger models, and better supervision, we propose a set
of strong and precise probability estimation models. We conduct systematic
evaluations across tasks that rely on conditional probability estimation and
show that our approach consistently outperforms existing fine-tuned and
prompting-based methods by a large margin.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in chatbots, code generators,
and search engines. Workloads such as chain-of-thought, complex reasoning, and
agent services significantly increase the inference cost by invoking the model
repeatedly. Optimization methods such as parallelism, compression, and caching
have been adopted to reduce costs, but the diverse service requirements make it
hard to select the right method. Recently, specialized LLM inference engines
have emerged as a key component for integrating the optimization methods into
service-oriented infrastructures. However, a systematic study on inference
engines is still lacking. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of 25
open-source and commercial inference engines. We examine each inference engine
in terms of ease-of-use, ease-of-deployment, general-purpose support,
scalability, and suitability for throughput- and latency-aware computation.
Furthermore, we explore the design goals of each inference engine by
investigating the optimization techniques it supports. In addition, we assess
the ecosystem maturity of open source inference engines and handle the
performance and cost policy of commercial solutions. We outline future research
directions that include support for complex LLM-based services, support of
various hardware, and enhanced security, offering practical guidance to
researchers and developers in selecting and designing optimized LLM inference
engines. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments
in this fast-evolving field:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光报告的自由文本复杂多变，传统NLP方法难以处理，LLM直接应用成本高且速度慢。

Method: 利用LLM生成高质量伪标签，再通过知识蒸馏训练DeBERTa-Base模型。

Result: 在MIMIC-500基准测试中，Macro F1达0.9120，优于现有方法，且推理速度快。

Conclusion: 结合LLM和知识蒸馏，可高效解决医学文本标注瓶颈。

Abstract: Automated labeling of chest X-ray reports is essential for enabling
downstream tasks such as training image-based diagnostic models, population
health studies, and clinical decision support. However, the high variability,
complexity, and prevalence of negation and uncertainty in these free-text
reports pose significant challenges for traditional Natural Language Processing
methods. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text
understanding, their direct application for large-scale, efficient labeling is
limited by computational cost and speed. This paper introduces DeBERTa-RAD, a
novel two-stage framework that combines the power of state-of-the-art LLM
pseudo-labeling with efficient DeBERTa-based knowledge distillation for
accurate and fast chest X-ray report labeling. We leverage an advanced LLM to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels, including certainty statuses, for a large
corpus of reports. Subsequently, a DeBERTa-Base model is trained on this
pseudo-labeled data using a tailored knowledge distillation strategy. Evaluated
on the expert-annotated MIMIC-500 benchmark, DeBERTa-RAD achieves a
state-of-the-art Macro F1 score of 0.9120, significantly outperforming
established rule-based systems, fine-tuned transformer models, and direct LLM
inference, while maintaining a practical inference speed suitable for
high-throughput applications. Our analysis shows particular strength in
handling uncertain findings. This work demonstrates a promising path to
overcome data annotation bottlenecks and achieve high-performance medical text
processing through the strategic combination of LLM capabilities and efficient
student models trained via distillation.

### [10] [Efficient Shapley Value-based Non-Uniform Pruning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01731)
*Chuan Sun,Han Yu,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley值的非均匀剪枝方法（SVNUP），用于优化大语言模型的剪枝效果，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法对所有层采用统一稀疏度，忽略了不同层的重要性差异，导致性能下降。

Method: SVNUP通过量化每层对模型性能的贡献，为不同层分配定制剪枝预算，并设计了滑动窗口Shapley值近似方法以减少计算开销。

Result: 实验表明，SVNUP在LLaMA和OPT等模型上显著优于传统方法，例如在70%稀疏度下，LLaMA-7B和LLaMA-13B的困惑度分别降低了18.01%和19.55%。

Conclusion: SVNUP通过非均匀剪枝策略有效提升了剪枝后模型的性能，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Pruning large language models (LLMs) is a promising solution for reducing
model sizes and computational complexity while preserving performance.
Traditional layer-wise pruning methods often adopt a uniform sparsity approach
across all layers, which leads to suboptimal performance due to the varying
significance of individual transformer layers within the model not being
accounted for. To this end, we propose the \underline{S}hapley
\underline{V}alue-based \underline{N}on-\underline{U}niform \underline{P}runing
(\methodname{}) method for LLMs. This approach quantifies the contribution of
each transformer layer to the overall model performance, enabling the
assignment of tailored pruning budgets to different layers to retain critical
parameters. To further improve efficiency, we design the Sliding Window-based
Shapley Value approximation method. It substantially reduces computational
overhead compared to exact SV calculation methods. Extensive experiments on
various LLMs including LLaMA-v1, LLaMA-v2 and OPT demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach. The results reveal that non-uniform pruning
significantly enhances the performance of pruned models. Notably, \methodname{}
achieves a reduction in perplexity (PPL) of 18.01\% and 19.55\% on LLaMA-7B and
LLaMA-13B, respectively, compared to SparseGPT at 70\% sparsity.

TLDR: 研究发现，长文本会影响LLM对机器翻译质量的评估，导致错误标注减少和系统排名准确性下降。通过改进提示和微调方法，可以缓解这种偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估长文档的机器翻译质量具有挑战性，LLM的上下文窗口扩大后，能否直接评估整篇文档的翻译质量成为研究重点。

Method: 研究了粒度对齐提示、焦点句子提示（FSP）和微调方法，以解决长文本评估中的偏差问题。

Result: 长文本导致错误标注减少和系统排名准确性下降，但FSP和微调方法有效缓解了这种偏差。

Conclusion: 改进的提示和微调方法使LLM更适用于长文本翻译评估。

Abstract: Accurately evaluating machine-translated text remains a long-standing
challenge, particularly for long documents. Recent work has shown that large
language models (LLMs) can serve as reliable and interpretable sentence-level
translation evaluators via MQM error span annotations. With modern LLMs
supporting larger context windows, a natural question arises: can we feed
entire document translations into an LLM for quality assessment? Ideally,
evaluation should be invariant to text length, producing consistent error spans
regardless of input granularity. However, our analysis shows that text length
significantly impacts evaluation: longer texts lead to fewer error spans and
reduced system ranking accuracy. To address this limitation, we evaluate
several strategies, including granularity-aligned prompting, Focus Sentence
Prompting (FSP), and a fine-tuning approach to better align LLMs with the
evaluation task. The latter two methods largely mitigate this length bias,
making LLMs more reliable for long-form translation evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高等教育中，软技能的公正评估是一个重要挑战，传统方法难以捕捉其复杂性和不确定性。

Method: 采用模糊逻辑和语言现象模型，结合多模态分析（如面部表情和手势识别），开发工具评估决策、沟通和创造力等软技能。

Conclusion: 多模态整合显著改善了软技能评估的透明度和可理解性，为教育利益相关者提供了更可靠的评估工具。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving educational landscape, the unbiased assessment of
soft skills is a significant challenge, particularly in higher education. This
paper presents a fuzzy logic approach that employs a Granular Linguistic Model
of Phenomena integrated with multimodal analysis to evaluate soft skills in
undergraduate students. By leveraging computational perceptions, this approach
enables a structured breakdown of complex soft skill expressions, capturing
nuanced behaviours with high granularity and addressing their inherent
uncertainties, thereby enhancing interpretability and reliability. Experiments
were conducted with undergraduate students using a developed tool that assesses
soft skills such as decision-making, communication, and creativity. This tool
identifies and quantifies subtle aspects of human interaction, such as facial
expressions and gesture recognition. The findings reveal that the framework
effectively consolidates multiple data inputs to produce meaningful and
consistent assessments of soft skills, showing that integrating multiple
modalities into the evaluation process significantly improves the quality of
soft skills scores, making the assessment work transparent and understandable
to educational stakeholders.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of AI-generated texts highlights the urgent
need for accurate and transparent detection tools, especially in educational
settings, where verifying authorship is essential. Existing literature has
demonstrated that the application of stylometric features with machine learning
classifiers can yield excellent results. Building on this foundation, this
study proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates stylometric analysis
with psycholinguistic theories, offering a clear and interpretable approach to
distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written texts. This research
specifically maps 31 distinct stylometric features to cognitive processes such
as lexical retrieval, discourse planning, cognitive load management, and
metacognitive self-monitoring. In doing so, it highlights the unique
psycholinguistic patterns found in human writing. Through the intersection of
computational linguistics and cognitive science, this framework contributes to
the development of reliable tools aimed at preserving academic integrity in the
era of generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决大型语言模型在微调过程中难以将新信息内化到权重中的问题，同时探索上下文学习与微调之间的性能差距。

Method: 方法包括创建New News数据集，提出Sys2-FT方法（包括自我问答协议），并系统评估模型在不同领域和规模下的表现。

Result: 结果显示Sys2-FT显著改善了模型的学习能力，同时发现了上下文遮蔽效应，并初步展示了Sys2-FT的规模扩展规律。

Conclusion: 结论表明Sys2-FT方法有效提升了模型内化新信息的能力，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Humans and intelligent animals can effortlessly internalize new information
("news") and accurately extract the implications for performing downstream
tasks. While large language models (LLMs) can achieve this through in-context
learning (ICL) when the news is explicitly given as context, fine-tuning
remains challenging for the models to consolidate learning in weights. In this
paper, we introduce $\textit{New News}$, a dataset composed of hypothetical yet
plausible news spanning multiple domains (mathematics, coding, discoveries,
leaderboards, events), accompanied by downstream evaluation questions whose
correct answers critically depend on understanding and internalizing the news.
We first demonstrate a substantial gap between naive fine-tuning and in-context
learning (FT-ICL gap) on our news dataset. To address this gap, we explore a
suite of self-play data generation protocols -- paraphrases, implications and
Self-QAs -- designed to distill the knowledge from the model with context into
the weights of the model without the context, which we term $\textit{System-2
Fine-tuning}$ (Sys2-FT). We systematically evaluate ICL and Sys2-FT performance
across data domains and model scales with the Qwen 2.5 family of models. Our
results demonstrate that the self-QA protocol of Sys2-FT significantly improves
models' in-weight learning of the news. Furthermore, we discover the
$\textit{contexual shadowing effect}$, where training with the news $\textit{in
context}$ followed by its rephrases or QAs degrade learning of the news.
Finally, we show preliminary evidence of an emerging scaling law of Sys2-FT.

*Anthony Nguyen,Wenjun Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Intra-Layer Recurrence (ILR)的方法，通过选择性在单个前向传递中对个别层应用循环，优化了Transformer模型的参数增长问题。实验表明，早期层分配更多迭代次数效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在自然语言处理中表现优异，但深度增加导致参数数量大幅增长。现有方法对整个层块不加区分地应用循环，效果有限。

Method: 提出Intra-Layer Recurrence (ILR)，在单个前向传递中针对个别层选择性应用循环。

Result: 实验结果显示，早期层分配更多迭代次数能取得最佳效果。

Conclusion: ILR为优化Transformer架构中的循环结构提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Transformer models have established new benchmarks in natural language
processing; however, their increasing depth results in substantial growth in
parameter counts. While existing recurrent transformer methods address this
issue by reprocessing layers multiple times, they often apply recurrence
indiscriminately across entire blocks of layers. In this work, we investigate
Intra-Layer Recurrence (ILR), a more targeted approach that applies recurrence
selectively to individual layers within a single forward pass. Our experiments
show that allocating more iterations to earlier layers yields optimal results.
These findings suggest that ILR offers a promising direction for optimizing
recurrent structures in transformer architectures.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于BERT的NER框架，通过位置注意力机制和预训练参数，降低训练成本并保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERT在NER任务中表现优异，但从头微调成本高且耗时，需一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 集成位置注意力机制，利用预训练参数实现高效定制。

Result: 在Kaggle数据集上表现优异，训练周期更少。

Conclusion: 该框架为降低BERT-NER系统训练成本提供了实用方案，同时保持高精度。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for Named Entity Recognition (NER) leveraging
the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model in
natural language processing (NLP). NER is a fundamental task in NLP with broad
applicability across downstream applications. While BERT has established itself
as a state-of-the-art model for entity recognition, fine-tuning it from scratch
for each new application is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To
address this, we propose a cost-efficient approach that integrates positional
attention mechanisms into the entity recognition process and enables effective
customization using pre-trained parameters. The framework is evaluated on a
Kaggle dataset derived from the Groningen Meaning Bank corpus and achieves
strong performance with fewer training epochs. This work contributes to the
field by offering a practical solution for reducing the training cost of
BERT-based NER systems while maintaining high accuracy.

*Jiří Milička,Anna Marklová,Ondřej Drobil,Eva Pospíšilová*

TLDR: 研究表明，通过即时反馈，人们可以学习区分人类写作与AI生成文本，并调整自我认知能力。反馈组在准确性和信心校准上表现显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人们是否能通过反馈学习区分人类与AI文本，并了解其依赖的判别标准。

Method: 使用GPT-4o生成文本，与人类文本对比，让255名参与者判断来源，分为反馈组和无反馈组。

Result: 反馈组在准确性和信心校准上显著提升，而无反馈组在信心高时错误最多。

Conclusion: 通过反馈训练可有效提升区分能力，纠正对AI文本的误解，对教育领域尤为重要。

Abstract: This study investigates whether individuals can learn to accurately
discriminate between human-written and AI-produced texts when provided with
immediate feedback, and if they can use this feedback to recalibrate their
self-perceived competence. We also explore the specific criteria individuals
rely upon when making these decisions, focusing on textual style and perceived
readability.
  We used GPT-4o to generate several hundred texts across various genres and
text types comparable to Koditex, a multi-register corpus of human-written
texts. We then presented randomized text pairs to 255 Czech native speakers who
identified which text was human-written and which was AI-generated.
Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: one receiving immediate
feedback after each trial, the other receiving no feedback until experiment
completion. We recorded accuracy in identification, confidence levels, response
times, and judgments about text readability along with demographic data and
participants' engagement with AI technologies prior to the experiment.
  Participants receiving immediate feedback showed significant improvement in
accuracy and confidence calibration. Participants initially held incorrect
assumptions about AI-generated text features, including expectations about
stylistic rigidity and readability. Notably, without feedback, participants
made the most errors precisely when feeling most confident -- an issue largely
resolved among the feedback group.
  The ability to differentiate between human and AI-generated texts can be
effectively learned through targeted training with explicit feedback, which
helps correct misconceptions about AI stylistic features and readability, as
well as potential other variables that were not explored, while facilitating
more accurate self-assessment. This finding might be particularly important in
educational contexts.

conflict-specific keywords, followed by automated sentiment labeling via
multiple pre-trained models to improve annotation robustness. We examine the
relationship between sentiment and contextual features such as timestamp,

metadata attributes. Finally, we develop an interactive visualization interface
to support exploration of sentiment trends and topic distributions across time
and regions. This work contributes a scalable methodology for social media
analysis in dynamic geopolitical contexts.

*Mazal Bethany,Nishant Vishwamitra,Cho-Yu Jason Chiang,Peyman Najafirad*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: CAMOUFLAGE是一种基于LLM的两代理系统，通过优化提示和攻击代理生成对抗性改写，绕过基于证据的虚假信息检测系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒文本对抗攻击不适用于基于证据的虚假信息检测系统，因其无法破坏系统的多组件结构（检索和比较模块）。

Method: CAMOUFLAGE采用两代理系统：提示优化代理分析失败攻击并优化提示，攻击代理生成语义等效的改写以误导系统。

Result: 在四个系统上测试，平均攻击成功率为46.92%，同时保持文本连贯性和语义等效性。

Conclusion: CAMOUFLAGE有效绕过检测系统，无需依赖分类器logits或大量查询，为对抗性攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: Automated evidence-based misinformation detection systems, which evaluate the
veracity of short claims against evidence, lack comprehensive analysis of their
adversarial vulnerabilities. Existing black-box text-based adversarial attacks
are ill-suited for evidence-based misinformation detection systems, as these
attacks primarily focus on token-level substitutions involving gradient or
logit-based optimization strategies, which are incapable of fooling the
multi-component nature of these detection systems. These systems incorporate
both retrieval and claim-evidence comparison modules, which requires attacks to
break the retrieval of evidence and/or the comparison module so that it draws
incorrect inferences. We present CAMOUFLAGE, an iterative, LLM-driven approach
that employs a two-agent system, a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker
Agent, to create adversarial claim rewritings that manipulate evidence
retrieval and mislead claim-evidence comparison, effectively bypassing the
system without altering the meaning of the claim. The Attacker Agent produces
semantically equivalent rewrites that attempt to mislead detectors, while the
Prompt Optimization Agent analyzes failed attack attempts and refines the
prompt of the Attacker to guide subsequent rewrites. This enables larger
structural and stylistic transformations of the text rather than token-level
substitutions, adapting the magnitude of changes based on previous outcomes.
Unlike existing approaches, CAMOUFLAGE optimizes its attack solely based on
binary model decisions to guide its rewriting process, eliminating the need for
classifier logits or extensive querying. We evaluate CAMOUFLAGE on four
systems, including two recent academic systems and two real-world APIs, with an
average attack success rate of 46.92\% while preserving textual coherence and
semantic equivalence to the original claims.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs隐含的社会认知态度（如权威、平等、自主等），填补现有研究在更广泛维度上的空白。

Method: 基于文化理论构建SWT框架，对28种LLMs进行实证分析，并通过社会参照理论实验验证社会反馈的影响。

Result: 发现LLMs具有可解释的认知特征，且社会反馈能系统性改变其态度，不同模型存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs的隐含偏见及其对社会反馈的响应，为开发更透明、社会责任感强的语言技术提供指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to daily life, widely
adopted in communication, decision-making, and information retrieval, raising
critical questions about how these systems implicitly form and express
socio-cognitive attitudes or "worldviews". While existing research extensively
addresses demographic and ethical biases, broader dimensions-such as attitudes
toward authority, equality, autonomy, and fate-remain under-explored. In this
paper, we introduce the Social Worldview Taxonomy (SWT), a structured framework
grounded in Cultural Theory, operationalizing four canonical worldviews
(Hierarchy, Egalitarianism, Individualism, Fatalism) into measurable
sub-dimensions. Using SWT, we empirically identify distinct and interpretable
cognitive profiles across 28 diverse LLMs. Further, inspired by Social
Referencing Theory, we experimentally demonstrate that explicit social cues
systematically shape these cognitive attitudes, revealing both general response
patterns and nuanced model-specific variations. Our findings enhance the
interpretability of LLMs by revealing implicit socio-cognitive biases and their
responsiveness to social feedback, thus guiding the development of more
transparent and socially responsible language technologies.

TLDR: 该研究利用自优化方法开发了一种LLM能力，用于最小化信息损失的文本简化，并通过大规模随机实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络上科学出版物和维基百科等内容超出用户阅读水平的问题，提高信息的可访问性。

Method: 采用自优化方法开发LLM文本简化能力，并通过4563名参与者的随机实验，比较原始文本与简化文本的理解效果。

Result: 简化文本显著提高了参与者的理解准确率（绝对提升3.9%），尤其是在生物医学领域（14.6%）。

Conclusion: LLM文本简化能力能有效帮助用户理解复杂信息，提升信息可访问性。

Abstract: Information on the web, such as scientific publications and Wikipedia, often
surpasses users' reading level. To help address this, we used a self-refinement
approach to develop a LLM capability for minimally lossy text simplification.
To validate our approach, we conducted a randomized study involving 4563
participants and 31 texts spanning 6 broad subject areas: PubMed (biomedical
scientific articles), biology, law, finance, literature/philosophy, and
aerospace/computer science. Participants were randomized to viewing original or
simplified texts in a subject area, and answered multiple-choice questions
(MCQs) that tested their comprehension of the text. The participants were also
asked to provide qualitative feedback such as task difficulty. Our results
indicate that participants who read the simplified text answered more MCQs
correctly than their counterparts who read the original text (3.9% absolute
increase, p<0.05). This gain was most striking with PubMed (14.6%), while more
moderate gains were observed for finance (5.5%), aerospace/computer science
(3.8%) domains, and legal (3.5%). Notably, the results were robust to whether
participants could refer back to the text while answering MCQs. The absolute
accuracy decreased by up to ~9% for both original and simplified setups where
participants could not refer back to the text, but the ~4% overall improvement
persisted. Finally, participants' self-reported perceived ease based on a
simplified NASA Task Load Index was greater for those who read the simplified
text (absolute change on a 5-point scale 0.33, p<0.05). This randomized study,
involving an order of magnitude more participants than prior works,
demonstrates the potential of LLMs to make complex information easier to
understand. Our work aims to enable a broader audience to better learn and make
use of expert knowledge available on the web, improving information
accessibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM依赖的网络数据常包含有害内容（如仇恨言论、偏见），可能引发伦理问题，需研究如何过滤和分类这些内容以确保模型安全。

Method: 提出分类法（Topical和Toxic）、评估数据集（TTP）、过滤模型（HarmFormer），并创建新基准（HAVOC）分析模型对有害输入的响应。

Result: 提供了有害内容的分类框架和过滤工具，为LLM预训练的安全性提供了解决方案。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM的安全预训练和伦理合规提供了资源和方法支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to various real-world
applications, leveraging massive, web-sourced datasets like Common Crawl, C4,
and FineWeb for pretraining. While these datasets provide linguistic data
essential for high-quality natural language generation, they often contain
harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation, and biased narratives.
Training LLMs on such unfiltered data risks perpetuating toxic behaviors,
spreading misinformation, and amplifying societal biases which can undermine
trust in LLM-driven applications and raise ethical concerns about their use.
This paper presents a large-scale analysis of inappropriate content across
these datasets, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes harmful
webpages into Topical and Toxic based on their intent. We also introduce a
prompt evaluation dataset, a high-accuracy Topical and Toxic Prompt (TTP), and
a transformer-based model (HarmFormer) for content filtering. Additionally, we
create a new multi-harm open-ended toxicity benchmark (HAVOC) and provide
crucial insights into how models respond to adversarial toxic inputs. Upon
publishing, we will also opensource our model signal on the entire C4 dataset.
Our work offers insights into ensuring safer LLM pretraining and serves as a
resource for Responsible AI (RAI) compliance.

Motivation: 随着语言学习需求的增长、远程教育的普及以及人口迁移等因素，智能代理的需求日益增加，但现有CALL系统多为原型或部分实现，缺乏全面解决方案。

Method: 本文从CALL系统开发者的视角，探讨了AI在语言学习中的应用方法，并尝试连接不同学科的研究成果。

Result: 研究发现，尽管AI在CALL中有广泛应用潜力，但完整解决方案仍较少，且缺乏针对AI在CALL领域的系统性综述。

Conclusion: 本文为AI在CALL中的应用提供了新视角，并呼吁更多跨学科合作以推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Computer-assisted language learning -- CALL -- is an established research
field. We review how artificial intelligence can be applied to support language
learning and teaching. The need for intelligent agents that assist language
learners and teachers is increasing: the human teacher's time is a scarce and
costly resource, which does not scale with growing demand. Further factors
contribute to the need for CALL: pandemics and increasing demand for distance
learning, migration of large populations, the need for sustainable and
affordable support for learning, etc. CALL systems are made up of many
components that perform various functions, and AI is applied to many different
aspects in CALL, corresponding to their own expansive research areas. Most of
what we find in the research literature and in practical use are prototypes or
partial implementations -- systems that perform some aspects of the overall
desired functionality. Complete solutions -- most of them commercial -- are
few, because they require massive resources. Recent advances in AI should
result in improvements in CALL, yet there is a lack of surveys that focus on AI
in the context of this research field. This paper aims to present a perspective
on the AI methods that can be employed for language learning from a position of
a developer of a CALL system. We also aim to connect work from different
disciplines, to build bridges for interdisciplinary work.

Result: 发现不同设置导致三种不同的输出分布，NLP研究常误认为这些分布应相似。

Conclusion: 为LLMs的解释奠定了更坚实的理论基础，有助于未来对LLMs诱导分布的解释和使用。

Abstract: The notion of language modeling has gradually shifted in recent years from a
distribution over finite-length strings to general-purpose prediction models
for textual inputs and outputs, following appropriate alignment phases. This
paper analyzes the distinction between distribution estimation and response
prediction in the context of LLMs, and their often conflicting goals. We
examine the training phases of LLMs, which include pretraining, in-context
learning, and preference tuning, and also the common use cases for their output
probabilities, which include completion probabilities and explicit
probabilities as output. We argue that the different settings lead to three
distinct intended output distributions. We demonstrate that NLP works often
assume that these distributions should be similar, which leads to
misinterpretations of their experimental findings. Our work sets firmer formal
foundations for the interpretation of LLMs, which will inform ongoing work on
the interpretation and use of LLMs' induced distributions.

of over 2,000 slides from more than 50 online course videos, annotated with
fine-grained human ratings across these rubrics. A model trained on this
dataset demonstrates superior accuracy and adaptability compared to existing
metrics, bridging the gap between automated and human assessments. We release

Abstract: Solving non-convex resource allocation problems poses significant challenges

automated resolution of non-convex resource allocation problems in wireless

Abstract: Despite significant advances in long-context reasoning by large language
models (LLMs), primarily through Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods,
these approaches incur substantial computational costs and complexity. In
contrast, simpler and more economical Offline RL methods remain underexplored.
To address this gap, we investigate the effectiveness of Offline RL methods,
specifically Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its length-desensitized
variant LD-DPO, in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Extensive
experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that these simpler
Offline RL methods substantially improve model performance, achieving an
average enhancement of 3.3\%, with a particularly notable increase of 10.1\% on
the challenging Arena-Hard benchmark. Furthermore, we analyze DPO's sensitivity
to output length, emphasizing that increasing reasoning length should align
with semantic richness, as indiscriminate lengthening may adversely affect
model performance. We provide comprehensive descriptions of our data processing
and training methodologies, offering empirical evidence and practical insights
for developing more cost-effective Offline RL approaches.

Result: 在4种DLS上平均准确率达95%，性能提升2.0倍，编程效率提升96.0倍。

Conclusion: QiMeng-Xpiler有效实现了跨平台张量程序的高效转编译，显著提升生产力。

Abstract: Heterogeneous deep learning systems (DLS) such as GPUs and ASICs have been
widely deployed in industrial data centers, which requires to develop multiple
low-level tensor programs for different platforms. An attractive solution to
relieve the programming burden is to transcompile the legacy code of one
platform to others. However, current transcompilation techniques struggle with
either tremendous manual efforts or functional incorrectness, rendering "Write
Once, Run Anywhere" of tensor programs an open question.
  We propose a novel transcompiler, i.e., QiMeng-Xpiler, for automatically
translating tensor programs across DLS via both large language models (LLMs)
and symbolic program synthesis, i.e., neural-symbolic synthesis. The key
insight is leveraging the powerful code generation ability of LLM to make
costly search-based symbolic synthesis computationally tractable. Concretely,
we propose multiple LLM-assisted compilation passes via pre-defined
meta-prompts for program transformation. During each program transformation,
efficient symbolic program synthesis is employed to repair incorrect code
snippets with a limited scale. To attain high performance, we propose a
hierarchical auto-tuning approach to systematically explore both the parameters
and sequences of transformation passes. Experiments on 4 DLS with distinct
programming interfaces, i.e., Intel DL Boost with VNNI, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA,
AMD MI with HIP, and Cambricon MLU with BANG, demonstrate that QiMeng-Xpiler
correctly translates different tensor programs at the accuracy of 95% on
average, and the performance of translated programs achieves up to 2.0x over
vendor-provided manually-optimized libraries. As a result, the programming
productivity of DLS is improved by up to 96.0x via transcompiling legacy tensor
programs.

Motivation: 当前方法缺乏动态调整推理深度的能力，导致资源浪费和社交模拟不准确。

Method: 提出AML框架，采用自适应模式策略优化（AMPO）算法，实现多粒度思维模式、上下文感知切换和高效推理。

Result: 实验显示AML在社交智能任务中表现优于现有方法15.6%，推理链缩短32.8%。

Conclusion: AMPO的上下文敏感思维模式选择比固定深度方法更接近人类推理。

Abstract: Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to
dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current
approaches. While existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning
capability or enforce uniform long chain-of-thought reasoning across all
scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inappropriate social
simulation. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode
$\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{AML}$) that strategically selects from four
thinking modes (intuitive reaction $\rightarrow$ deep contemplation) based on
real-time context. Our framework's core innovation, the $\textbf{A}$daptive
$\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{AMPO}$)
algorithm, introduces three key advancements over existing methods: (1)
Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across
social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive
processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence tasks confirm that AML
achieves 15.6% higher task performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably,
our method outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains. These
results demonstrate that context-sensitive thinking mode selection, as
implemented in AMPO, enables more human-like adaptive reasoning than GRPO's
fixed-depth approach

Abstract: This paper presents a domain-specific implementation of Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) tailored to the Fair Use Doctrine in U.S. copyright law.
Motivated by the increasing prevalence of DMCA takedowns and the lack of
accessible legal support for content creators, we propose a structured approach
that combines semantic search with legal knowledge graphs and court citation
networks to improve retrieval quality and reasoning reliability. Our prototype
models legal precedents at the statutory factor level (e.g., purpose, nature,
amount, market effect) and incorporates citation-weighted graph representations
to prioritize doctrinally authoritative sources. We use Chain-of-Thought

*Henrik Brådland,Morten Goodwin,Per-Arne Andersen,Alexander S. Nossum,Aditya Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为HOPE的新方法，用于评估文档分块对RAG系统的影响，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型对检索数据的布局和结构敏感，但目前缺乏分析不同分块方法影响的框架。

Method: 提出HOPE评估指标，从内在、外在和连贯性三个层次量化分块特性。

Result: HOPE与RAG性能显著相关，语义独立性对性能提升至关重要，而传统概念统一性假设影响较小。

Conclusion: 研究为优化分块策略提供了实用建议，有助于设计更准确的RAG系统。

Abstract: Document chunking fundamentally impacts Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
by determining how source materials are segmented before indexing. Despite
evidence that Large Language Models (LLMs) are sensitive to the layout and
structure of retrieved data, there is currently no framework to analyze the
impact of different chunking methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel
methodology that defines essential characteristics of the chunking process at
three levels: intrinsic passage properties, extrinsic passage properties, and
passages-document coherence. We propose HOPE (Holistic Passage Evaluation), a
domain-agnostic, automatic evaluation metric that quantifies and aggregates
these characteristics. Our empirical evaluations across seven domains
demonstrate that the HOPE metric correlates significantly (p > 0.13) with
various RAG performance indicators, revealing contrasts between the importance
of extrinsic and intrinsic properties of passages. Semantic independence
between passages proves essential for system performance with a performance
gain of up to 56.2% in factual correctness and 21.1% in answer correctness. On
the contrary, traditional assumptions about maintaining concept unity within
passages show minimal impact. These findings provide actionable insights for
optimizing chunking strategies, thus improving RAG system design to produce
more factually correct responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在法律任务中的表现，探索其潜力与局限性。

Method: 使用CaseHOLD数据集测试不同规模LLMs，并设计匿名化测试验证性能。

Result: 模型性能随规模提升，GPT4o和AmazonNovaPro分别达到0.744和0.720的F1分数。匿名化测试下性能仍强。

Conclusion: LLMs在法律任务中表现优异，但需进一步开发与评估法律基准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, it is
essential to assess how they perform on established benchmarks. In this study,
we present a suite of experiments to assess the performance of modern LLMs
(ranging from 3B to 90B+ parameters) on CaseHOLD, a legal benchmark dataset for
identifying case holdings. Our experiments demonstrate ``scaling effects'' -
performance on this task improves with model size, with more capable models
like GPT4o and AmazonNovaPro achieving macro F1 scores of 0.744 and 0.720
respectively. These scores are competitive with the best published results on
this dataset, and do not require any technically sophisticated model training,
fine-tuning or few-shot prompting. To ensure that these strong results are not
due to memorization of judicial opinions contained in the training data, we
develop and utilize a novel citation anonymization test that preserves semantic
meaning while ensuring case names and citations are fictitious. Models maintain
strong performance under these conditions (macro F1 of 0.728), suggesting the
performance is not due to rote memorization. These findings demonstrate both
the promise and current limitations of LLMs for legal tasks with important
implications for the development and measurement of automated legal analytics
and legal benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 香港的语言环境（繁体中文和粤语）和文化背景在现有评估基准中未得到充分体现，因此开发HKMMLU以填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含多领域多选题和翻译任务的HKMMLU基准，并在多种LLMs上进行测试，分析语言、模型规模等因素对性能的影响。

Result: 最佳模型DeepSeek-V3准确率仅75%，显著低于其他基准，表明LLMs在香港特定语言和知识领域的不足。

Conclusion: HKMMLU有助于推动LLMs在多语言和跨文化背景下的发展，提升其应用广度。

Abstract: Multilingual understanding is crucial for the cross-cultural applicability of
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, evaluation benchmarks designed for Hong
Kong's unique linguistic landscape, which combines Traditional Chinese script
with Cantonese as the spoken form and its cultural context, remain
underdeveloped. To address this gap, we introduce HKMMLU, a multi-task language
understanding benchmark that evaluates Hong Kong's linguistic competence and
socio-cultural knowledge. The HKMMLU includes 26,698 multi-choice questions
across 66 subjects, organized into four categories: Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), Social Sciences, Humanities, and Other. To
evaluate the multilingual understanding ability of LLMs, 90,550
Mandarin-Cantonese translation tasks were additionally included. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and 18 open-source LLMs
of varying sizes on HKMMLU. The results show that the best-performing model,
DeepSeek-V3, struggles to achieve an accuracy of 75\%, significantly lower than
that of MMLU and CMMLU. This performance gap highlights the need to improve
LLMs' capabilities in Hong Kong-specific language and knowledge domains.
Furthermore, we investigate how question language, model size, prompting
strategies, and question and reasoning token lengths affect model performance.
We anticipate that HKMMLU will significantly advance the development of LLMs in
multilingual and cross-cultural contexts, thereby enabling broader and more
impactful applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前文本摘要评估方法在性能和可解释性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）用LLM从文本和摘要中提取原子语句；2）匹配生成的语句，提供语句级对齐证据。

Result: 在SummEval基准测试中，SEval-Ex以0.580的相关性优于GPT-4评估器（0.521），并保持可解释性。

Conclusion: SEval-Ex在性能和可解释性上均表现优异，且对幻觉具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Evaluating text summarization quality remains a critical challenge in Natural
Language Processing. Current approaches face a trade-off between performance
and interpretability. We present SEval-Ex, a framework that bridges this gap by
decomposing summarization evaluation into atomic statements, enabling both high
performance and explainability. SEval-Ex employs a two-stage pipeline: first
extracting atomic statements from text source and summary using LLM, then a
matching between generated statements. Unlike existing approaches that provide
only summary-level scores, our method generates detailed evidence for its
decisions through statement-level alignments. Experiments on the SummEval
benchmark demonstrate that SEval-Ex achieves state-of-the-art performance with
0.580 correlation on consistency with human consistency judgments, surpassing
GPT-4 based evaluators (0.521) while maintaining interpretability. Finally, our
framework shows robustness against hallucination.

Motivation: 评估个性化信息对LLMs行为的影响，特别是在敏感话题（如仇恨言论）中，以解决未充分研究的领域。

Method: 研究多种先进LLMs在不同个性化场景下的行为，通过模拟国家特定角色和多语言环境检测仇恨言论，并对模型进行微调以减少偏见。

Result: 个性化上下文显著影响LLMs的响应，微调后的模型在有无个性化上下文的情况下均表现更优。

Conclusion: 个性化信息对LLMs行为有显著影响，微调可有效减少偏见，提升模型在敏感话题中的表现。

Abstract: Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently incorporated memory
features to deliver personalised responses. This memory retains details such as
user demographics and individual characteristics, allowing LLMs to adjust their
behaviour based on personal information. However, the impact of integrating
personalised information into the context has not been thoroughly assessed,
leading to questions about its influence on LLM behaviour. Personalisation can
be challenging, particularly with sensitive topics. In this paper, we examine
various state-of-the-art LLMs to understand their behaviour in different
personalisation scenarios, specifically focusing on hate speech. We prompt the
models to assume country-specific personas and use different languages for hate
speech detection. Our findings reveal that context personalisation
significantly influences LLMs' responses in this sensitive area. To mitigate
these unwanted biases, we fine-tune the LLMs by penalising inconsistent hate
speech classifications made with and without country or language-specific
context. The refined models demonstrate improved performance in both
personalised contexts and when no context is provided.

Motivation: 传统嵌入层参数多但性能提升不成比例，需更高效的方法。

Method: 通过傅里叶展开和MLP生成嵌入向量，替代传统嵌入层。

Result: 在NLI任务和STS-B上表现竞争性，参数更少、训练更快。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了高效语言模型的潜力，值得进一步大规模实验。

Abstract: Embedding layers in transformer-based NLP models typically account for the
largest share of model parameters, scaling with vocabulary size but not
yielding performance gains proportional to scale. We propose an alternative
approach in which token embedding vectors are first generated
deterministically, directly from the token IDs using a Fourier expansion of
their normalized values, followed by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP)
that captures higher-order interactions. We train standard transformers and our
architecture on natural language inference tasks (SNLI and MNLI), and evaluate
zero-shot performance on sentence textual similarity (STS-B). Our results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance using
significantly fewer parameters, trains faster, and operates effectively without
the need for dropout. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential for
scalable, memory-efficient language models and motivates further large-scale
experimentation based on our findings.

Result: 优化提示主要由罕见标点和名词组成，激活模式与自然语言不同，且在各类模型中表现一致。

Conclusion: 优化提示通过特定路径影响模型输出，揭示了其调控机制。

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) are not robust to out-of-distribution inputs.
Machine generated (``optimized'') prompts can be used to modulate LM outputs
and induce specific behaviors while appearing completely uninterpretable. In
this work, we investigate the composition of optimized prompts, as well as the
mechanisms by which LMs parse and build predictions from optimized prompts. We
find that optimized prompts primarily consist of punctuation and noun tokens
which are more rare in the training data. Internally, optimized prompts are
clearly distinguishable from natural language counterparts based on sparse
subsets of the model's activations. Across various families of
instruction-tuned models, optimized prompts follow a similar path in how their
representations form through the network.

Conclusion: GSP-MC方法展示了跨语言有效性，为开发包容性通信技术提供了潜力。

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) faces fundamental challenges in creating
accurate annotations due to the inherent complexity of simultaneous manual and
non-manual signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
integrate generative large language models (LLMs) into SLR tasks. We propose a
novel Generative Sign-description Prompts Multi-positive Contrastive learning
(GSP-MC) method that leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
domain-specific LLMs, incorporating multi-step prompt engineering and
expert-validated sign language corpora to produce precise multipart
descriptions. The GSP-MC method also employs a dual-encoder architecture to
bidirectionally align hierarchical skeleton features with multiple text
descriptions (global, synonym, and part level) through probabilistic matching.
Our approach combines global and part-level losses, optimizing KL divergence to
ensure robust alignment across all relevant text-skeleton pairs while capturing
both sign-level semantics and detailed part dynamics. Experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance against existing methods on the Chinese SLR500
(reaching 97.1%) and Turkish AUTSL datasets (97.07% accuracy). The method's
cross-lingual effectiveness highlight its potential for developing inclusive

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练，适用于多种基于Transformer的语言模型，显著提升实时幻觉检测能力。

Abstract: The collaborative paradigm of large and small language models (LMs)
effectively balances performance and cost, yet its pivotal challenge lies in
precisely pinpointing the moment of invocation when hallucinations arise in
small LMs. Previous optimization efforts primarily focused on post-processing
techniques, which were separate from the reasoning process of LMs, resulting in
high computational costs and limited effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a
practical invocation evaluation metric called AttenHScore, which calculates the
accumulation and propagation of hallucinations during the generation process of
small LMs, continuously amplifying potential reasoning errors. By dynamically
adjusting the detection threshold, we achieve more accurate real-time
invocation of large LMs. Additionally, considering the limited reasoning
capacity of small LMs, we leverage uncertainty-aware knowledge reorganization
to assist them better capture critical information from different text chunks.
Extensive experiments reveal that our AttenHScore outperforms most baseline in
enhancing real-time hallucination detection capabilities across multiple QA
datasets, especially when addressing complex queries. Moreover, our strategies
eliminate the need for additional model training and display flexibility in
adapting to various transformer-based LMs.

Motivation: 探索策略内和策略外数据在偏好学习中的互补作用，以优化语言模型的对齐效果。

Method: 提出SIMPLEMIX方法，通过混合策略内和策略外数据，结合两者的优势。

Result: SIMPLEMIX在Alpaca Eval 2.0上平均优于策略内和策略外DPO方法6.03%，并优于其他复杂方法3.05%。

Conclusion: SIMPLEMIX是一种简单有效的方法，显著提升了语言模型的对齐性能。

Abstract: Aligning language models with human preferences relies on pairwise preference
datasets. While some studies suggest that on-policy data consistently
outperforms off -policy data for preference learning, others indicate that the
advantages of on-policy data may be task-dependent, highlighting the need for a
systematic exploration of their interplay.
  In this work, we show that on-policy and off-policy data offer complementary
strengths in preference optimization: on-policy data is particularly effective
for reasoning tasks like math and coding, while off-policy data performs better
on open-ended tasks such as creative writing and making personal
recommendations. Guided by these findings, we introduce SIMPLEMIX, an approach
to combine the complementary strengths of on-policy and off-policy preference
learning by simply mixing these two data sources. Our empirical results across
diverse tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that SIMPLEMIX substantially improves
language model alignment. Specifically, SIMPLEMIX improves upon on-policy DPO
and off-policy DPO by an average of 6.03% on Alpaca Eval 2.0. Moreover, it
outperforms prior approaches that are much more complex in combining on- and
off-policy data, such as HyPO and DPO-Mix-P, by an average of 3.05%.

Conclusion: JTCSE通过结合模约束和交叉注意力，显著提升了无监督对比学习的性能，并在多项任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Unsupervised contrastive learning has become a hot research topic in natural
language processing. Existing works usually aim at constraining the orientation
distribution of the representations of positive and negative samples in the
high-dimensional semantic space in contrastive learning, but the semantic
representation tensor possesses both modulus and orientation features, and the
existing works ignore the modulus feature of the representations and cause
insufficient contrastive learning. % Therefore, we firstly propose a training
objective that aims at modulus constraints on the semantic representation
tensor, to strengthen the alignment between the positive samples in contrastive
learning. Therefore, we first propose a training objective that is designed to
impose modulus constraints on the semantic representation tensor, to strengthen
the alignment between positive samples in contrastive learning. Then, the
BERT-like model suffers from the phenomenon of sinking attention, leading to a
lack of attention to CLS tokens that aggregate semantic information. In
response, we propose a cross-attention structure among the twin-tower ensemble
models to enhance the model's attention to CLS token and optimize the quality
of CLS Pooling. Combining the above two motivations, we propose a new
\textbf{J}oint \textbf{T}ensor representation modulus constraint and
\textbf{C}ross-attention unsupervised contrastive learning \textbf{S}entence
\textbf{E}mbedding representation framework JTCSE, which we evaluate in seven
semantic text similarity computation tasks, and the experimental results show
that JTCSE's twin-tower ensemble model and single-tower distillation model
outperform the other baselines and become the current SOTA. In addition, we
have conducted an extensive zero-shot downstream task evaluation, which shows
that JTCSE outperforms other baselines overall on more than 130 tasks.

Result: ReasRMs在多个基准测试中表现优异，性能超越大型开源和专有模型高达13.8%。

Conclusion: 推理能力的引入显著提升了奖励模型的解释性和性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences, especially through reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should
stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a
score or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores
or directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle
to integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability.
Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on
reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating
reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's
interpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of
generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which
formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented
training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists
of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by
self-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating
candidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve
state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across
multiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger
open-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by
up to 13.8%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis
to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate
future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at
https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.

Abstract: One of the goals of fairness research in NLP is to measure and mitigate
stereotypical biases that are propagated by NLP systems. However, such work
tends to focus on single axes of bias (most often gender) and the English
language. Addressing these limitations, we contribute the first study of
multilingual intersecting country and gender biases, with a focus on occupation
recommendations generated by large language models. We construct a benchmark of
prompts in English, Spanish and German, where we systematically vary country
and gender, using 25 countries and four pronoun sets. Then, we evaluate a suite
of 5 Llama-based models on this benchmark, finding that LLMs encode significant
gender and country biases. Notably, we find that even when models show parity
for gender or country individually, intersectional occupational biases based on
both country and gender persist. We also show that the prompting language
significantly affects bias, and instruction-tuned models consistently
demonstrate the lowest and most stable levels of bias. Our findings highlight
the need for fairness researchers to use intersectional and multilingual lenses
in their work.

Abstract: In this paper,we explore the application of Back translation (BT) as a
semi-supervised technique to enhance Neural Machine Translation(NMT) models for
the English-Luganda language pair, specifically addressing the challenges faced
by low-resource languages. The purpose of our study is to demonstrate how BT
can mitigate the scarcity of bilingual data by generating synthetic data from
monolingual corpora. Our methodology involves developing custom NMT models
using both publicly available and web-crawled data, and applying Iterative and
Incremental Back translation techniques. We strategically select datasets for
incremental back translation across multiple small datasets, which is a novel
element of our approach. The results of our study show significant
improvements, with translation performance for the English-Luganda pair
exceeding previous benchmarks by more than 10 BLEU score units across all
translation directions. Additionally, our evaluation incorporates comprehensive
assessment metrics such as SacreBLEU, ChrF2, and TER, providing a nuanced
understanding of translation quality. The conclusion drawn from our research

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于集成学习的多目标强化学习框架（EMORL），通过优化多个模型的聚合来提升效率和灵活性，并在心理咨询生成任务中验证了其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在大型语言模型微调中面临多目标平衡、训练效率低、可扩展性差和可解释性有限等挑战。

Method: 引入EMORL框架，通过集成多个单目标模型并优化其聚合，结合分层网格搜索算法确定最优权重组合。

Result: 在PAIR和Psych8k数据集上，EMORL表现出更低的训练消耗（17,529±1,650数据点和6,573±147.43秒）、更高的可扩展性和可解释性，且多目标性能与基线相当。

Conclusion: EMORL框架在多目标强化学习任务中具有显著优势，为复杂任务提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language model (LLM)
fine-tuning show promise in addressing multi-objective tasks but still face
significant challenges, including complex objective balancing, low training
efficiency, poor scalability, and limited explainability. Leveraging ensemble
learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL)
framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while
optimizing their aggregation after the training to improve efficiency and
flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the last hidden states of
individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple
objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm
that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor
reflection generation tasks, using text-scoring LLMs to evaluate the
generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive
experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of
EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training
consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds),
improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across
multiple objectives.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于贝叶斯框架的句子理解方法，通过扩展集成卡尔曼滤波（EnKF）来量化不确定性，改进了传统人工神经网络（ANN）模型在不确定性处理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工神经网络（ANN）在句子处理中表现出确定性行为，无法像人类一样处理不确定性（如反转异常句子），因此需要一种能更好反映人类认知的方法。

Method: 采用贝叶斯框架，将语言理解视为逆问题，并扩展集成卡尔曼滤波（EnKF）进行贝叶斯推断，以量化不确定性。

Result: 数值实验和与最大似然估计（MLE）的比较表明，贝叶斯方法能更好地表示不确定性，使模型更接近人类认知处理。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯框架显著提升了模型在不确定性处理上的表现，使其更接近人类句子理解的动态过程。

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widely used in modeling sentence
processing but often exhibit deterministic behavior, contrasting with human
sentence comprehension, which manages uncertainty during ambiguous or
unexpected inputs. This is exemplified by reversal anomalies-sentences with
unexpected role reversals that challenge syntax and semantics-highlighting the
limitations of traditional ANN models, such as the Sentence Gestalt (SG) Model.
To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian framework for sentence
comprehension, applying an extension of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for
Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty. By framing language comprehension
as a Bayesian inverse problem, this approach enhances the SG model's ability to
reflect human sentence processing with respect to the representation of
uncertainty. Numerical experiments and comparisons with maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) demonstrate that Bayesian methods improve uncertainty
representation, enabling the model to better approximate human cognitive
processing when dealing with linguistic ambiguities.

Abstract: Second language proficiency (L2) in English is usually perceptually evaluated
by English teachers or expert evaluators, with the inherent intra- and
inter-rater variability. This paper explores deep learning techniques for
comprehensive L2 proficiency assessment, addressing both the speech signal and
its correspondent transcription. We analyze spoken proficiency classification
prediction using diverse architectures, including 2D CNN, frequency-based CNN,
ResNet, and a pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model. Additionally, we examine text-based
proficiency assessment by fine-tuning a BERT language model within resource
constraints. Finally, we tackle the complex task of spontaneous dialogue
assessment, managing long-form audio and speaker interactions through separate
applications of wav2vec 2.0 and BERT models. Results from experiments on
EFCamDat and ANGLISH datasets and a private dataset highlight the potential of
deep learning, especially the pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model, for robust
automated L2 proficiency evaluation.

equivalent glosses, and present the challenges and guidelines we followed to
create it. We benchmark GPT-4o on the task of recovering full diacritization
given the undiacritized Arabic and English forms, and analyze its performance.
Achieving 73% accuracy, our results underscore both the difficulty of the task
and the need for improved models and resources. We release our dataset to
facilitate further research on Arabic Wikipedia proper name diacritization.

Conclusion: 提出了未来LLM对齐的创新奖励设计策略研究方向。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values and
intentions represents a core challenge in current AI research, where reward
mechanism design has become a critical factor in shaping model behavior. This
study conducts a comprehensive investigation of reward mechanisms in LLM
alignment through a systematic theoretical framework, categorizing their
development into three key phases: (1) feedback (diagnosis), (2) reward design
(prescription), and (3) optimization (treatment). Through a four-dimensional
analysis encompassing construction basis, format, expression, and granularity,
this research establishes a systematic classification framework that reveals
evolutionary trends in reward modeling. The field of LLM alignment faces
several persistent challenges, while recent advances in reward design are
driving significant paradigm shifts. Notable developments include the
transition from reinforcement learning-based frameworks to novel optimization
paradigms, as well as enhanced capabilities to address complex alignment
scenarios involving multimodal integration and concurrent task coordination.
Finally, this survey outlines promising future research directions for LLM
alignment through innovative reward design strategies.

Result: 奖励学习赋予LLM对齐偏好和深度推理能力，支撑了多种技术如RLHF和DPO。

Conclusion: 奖励学习是LLM发展的关键范式，但仍需解决挑战并探索未来方向。

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from
pre-training scaling to post-training and test-time scaling. Across these
developments, a key unified paradigm has arisen: Learning from Rewards, where
reward signals act as the guiding stars to steer LLM behavior. It has
underpinned a wide range of prevalent techniques, such as reinforcement
learning (in RLHF, DPO, and GRPO), reward-guided decoding, and post-hoc
correction. Crucially, this paradigm enables the transition from passive
learning from static data to active learning from dynamic feedback. This endows
LLMs with aligned preferences and deep reasoning capabilities. In this survey,
we present a comprehensive overview of the paradigm of learning from rewards.
We categorize and analyze the strategies under this paradigm across training,
inference, and post-inference stages. We further discuss the benchmarks for
reward models and the primary applications. Finally we highlight the challenges
and future directions. We maintain a paper collection at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABX任务在评估语音表示的自监督学习中广泛应用，但缺乏高效工具限制了其更广泛采用。

Method: fastabx提供了一个框架，支持构建任何类型的ABX任务，并高效计算表示间的距离。

Result: fastabx成为表示学习社区的有价值资源，支持跨领域研究。

Conclusion: fastabx有望促进对学习表示中可提取信息的系统性研究。

Abstract: We introduce fastabx, a high-performance Python library for building ABX
discrimination tasks. ABX is a measure of the separation between generic
categories of interest. It has been used extensively to evaluate phonetic
discriminability in self-supervised speech representations. However, its
broader adoption has been limited by the absence of adequate tools. fastabx
addresses this gap by providing a framework capable of constructing any type of
ABX task while delivering the efficiency necessary for rapid development
cycles, both in task creation and in calculating distances between
representations. We believe that fastabx will serve as a valuable resource for
the broader representation learning community, enabling researchers to
systematically investigate what information can be directly extracted from
learned representations across several domains beyond speech processing. The
source code is available at https://github.com/bootphon/fastabx.

Motivation: 法律实践中对程序规则的严格遵守至关重要，而《蓝皮书》的复杂格式要求是律师和学生的痛点。研究旨在验证LLMs能否胜任此类高精度任务。

Method: 构建了包含866项《蓝皮书》任务的原创数据集，测试了OpenAI、Anthropic等公司的旗舰LLMs，并评估其合规性。

Result: LLMs生成完全合规引用的成功率仅为69%-74%，上下文学习后提升至77%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，现成的LLMs在法律程序自动化中的应用需谨慎，因其对规则的遵守尚不完善。

Abstract: Legal practice requires careful adherence to procedural rules. In the United
States, few are more complex than those found in The Bluebook: A Uniform System
of Citation. Compliance with this system's 500+ pages of byzantine formatting
instructions is the raison d'etre of thousands of student law review editors
and the bete noire of lawyers everywhere. To evaluate whether large language
models (LLMs) are able to adhere to the procedures of such a complicated
system, we construct an original dataset of 866 Bluebook tasks and test
flagship LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and DeepSeek. We show (1)
that these models produce fully compliant Bluebook citations only 69%-74% of
the time and (2) that in-context learning on the Bluebook's underlying system
of rules raises accuracy only to 77%. These results caution against using
off-the-shelf LLMs to automate aspects of the law where fidelity to procedure

TLDR: ReplaceMe是一种无需训练的通用深度剪枝方法，通过线性操作替换Transformer块，在低压缩比下保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法需要额外训练或微调，而ReplaceMe仅需少量校准数据集，无需额外网络参数。

Method: 使用校准数据集估计线性变换以近似剪枝块，并将其无缝合并到剩余Transformer块中。

Result: 在多个大型语言模型上，ReplaceMe实现25%剪枝，保留90%性能，计算开销极小。

Conclusion: ReplaceMe在无需训练的情况下优于其他方法，与需微调的最先进方法竞争，并开源实现。

Abstract: We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that
effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while
maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to
conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or
fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is
used to estimate a linear transformation to approximate the pruned blocks. This
estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining
transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters.
Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other
training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art
pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural
modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe
achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original
model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps,
resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an
open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art
depth pruning techniques, available at this repository.

TLDR: MCA-Ctrl是一种无需调优的方法，通过多党协作注意力控制，利用文本和复杂视觉条件实现高质量图像定制，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像定制方法存在多种限制，如仅支持单一条件输入、复杂场景下的主题泄漏或混淆、背景不一致以及高计算成本。

Method: MCA-Ctrl通过自注意力层的两个关键操作协调多个并行扩散过程，并引入主题定位模块以提取精确主题和可编辑图像层。

Result: 实验表明，MCA-Ctrl在零样本图像定制中优于现有方法，有效解决了主题泄漏、背景不一致等问题。

Conclusion: MCA-Ctrl为复杂视觉条件下的图像定制提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has increased the need for
customized image generation. However, current customization methods face
several limitations: 1) typically accept either image or text conditions alone;
2) customization in complex visual scenarios often leads to subject leakage or
confusion; 3) image-conditioned outputs tend to suffer from inconsistent
backgrounds; and 4) high computational costs. To address these issues, this
paper introduces Multi-party Collaborative Attention Control (MCA-Ctrl), a
tuning-free method that enables high-quality image customization using both
text and complex visual conditions. Specifically, MCA-Ctrl leverages two key
operations within the self-attention layer to coordinate multiple parallel
diffusion processes and guide the target image generation. This approach allows
MCA-Ctrl to capture the content and appearance of specific subjects while
maintaining semantic consistency with the conditional input. Additionally, to
mitigate subject leakage and confusion issues common in complex visual
scenarios, we introduce a Subject Localization Module that extracts precise
subject and editable image layers based on user instructions. Extensive
quantitative and human evaluation experiments show that MCA-Ctrl outperforms
existing methods in zero-shot image customization, effectively resolving the
mentioned issues.

Motivation: mpox是一种人传人的病毒性疾病，早期临床诊断困难，因其症状与麻疹和水痘相似。结合医学影像和深度学习技术有望提高疾病检测。

Method: 使用公开皮肤病变图像数据集训练DL和ViT模型，发现数据限制后采用迁移学习和预训练模型（如MobileNet-v2、ViT B16和ResNet-50）。

Result: MobileNet-v2表现最佳，准确率93.15%，F1分数93.09%。ViT B16和ResNet-50分别达到92.12%和86.21%的准确率。

Conclusion: 迁移学习和预训练模型能有效解决数据限制问题，提升mpox检测性能，MobileNet-v2表现最优。

Abstract: Since mpox can spread from person to person, it is a zoonotic viral illness
that poses a significant public health concern. It is difficult to make an
early clinical diagnosis because of how closely its symptoms match those of
measles and chickenpox. Medical imaging combined with deep learning (DL)
techniques has shown promise in improving disease detection by analyzing
affected skin areas. Our study explore the feasibility to train deep learning
and vision transformer-based models from scratch with publicly available skin
lesion image dataset. Our experimental results show dataset limitation as a
major drawback to build better classifier models trained from scratch. We used
transfer learning with the help of pre-trained models to get a better
classifier. The MobileNet-v2 outperformed other state of the art pre-trained
models with 93.15% accuracy and 93.09% weighted average F1 score. ViT B16 and
ResNet-50 also achieved satisfactory performance compared to already available
studies with accuracy 92.12% and 86.21% respectively. To further validate the
performance of the models, we applied explainable AI techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型在生成图像时容易延续训练数据中的文化偏见，导致系统性误表示，因此需要一种评估工具来诊断和减少这些偏见。

Method: 通过分析2400张图像，量化了模型在组合脆弱性和上下文错位方面的偏见，并提出了CIS指标来评估生成图像的文化保真度。

Result: 研究发现数据不平衡、注意力熵和嵌入叠加对模型公平性有显著影响，并揭示了西方与非西方文化提示间的性能差距。

Conclusion: CIS为诊断和减少T2I生成中的偏见提供了全面工具，推动了更公平的AI系统的发展。

Abstract: The transformative potential of text-to-image (T2I) models hinges on their
ability to synthesize culturally diverse, photorealistic images from textual
prompts. However, these models often perpetuate cultural biases embedded within
their training data, leading to systemic misrepresentations. This paper
benchmarks the Component Inclusion Score (CIS), a metric designed to evaluate
the fidelity of image generation across cultural contexts. Through extensive
analysis involving 2,400 images, we quantify biases in terms of compositional
fragility and contextual misalignment, revealing significant performance gaps
between Western and non-Western cultural prompts. Our findings underscore the
impact of data imbalance, attention entropy, and embedding superposition on
model fairness. By benchmarking models like Stable Diffusion with CIS, we
provide insights into architectural and data-centric interventions for
enhancing cultural inclusivity in AI-generated imagery. This work advances the
field by offering a comprehensive tool for diagnosing and mitigating biases in
T2I generation, advocating for more equitable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪装物体分割因物体与背景高度相似而具有挑战性，现有零样本方法表现不佳，光流在检测移动物体中表现优异，因此被整合到新方法中。

Method: 通过将光流、视觉语言模型和SAM 2结合为顺序流程，提出了一种零样本分割方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了伪装物体分割的性能，验证了各组件的重要性，为相关领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Camouflaged object segmentation presents unique challenges compared to
traditional segmentation tasks, primarily due to the high similarity in
patterns and colors between camouflaged objects and their backgrounds.
Effective solutions to this problem have significant implications in critical
areas such as pest control, defect detection, and lesion segmentation in
medical imaging. Prior research has predominantly emphasized supervised or
unsupervised pre-training methods, leaving zero-shot approaches significantly
underdeveloped. Existing zero-shot techniques commonly utilize the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) in automatic mode or rely on vision-language models to
generate cues for segmentation; however, their performances remain
unsatisfactory, likely due to the similarity of the camouflaged object and the
background. Optical flow, commonly utilized for detecting moving objects, has
demonstrated effectiveness even with camouflaged entities. Our method
integrates optical flow, a vision-language model, and SAM 2 into a sequential
pipeline. Evaluated on the MoCA-Mask dataset, our approach achieves outstanding
performance improvements, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot
methods by raising the F-measure ($F_\beta^w$) from 0.296 to 0.628. Remarkably,
our approach also surpasses supervised methods, increasing the F-measure from
0.476 to 0.628. Additionally, evaluation on the MoCA-Filter dataset
demonstrates an increase in the success rate from 0.628 to 0.697 when compared
with FlowSAM, a supervised transfer method. A thorough ablation study further
validates the individual contributions of each component. More details can be

Abstract: Synthetic video generation with foundation models has gained attention for
its realism and wide applications. While these models produce high-quality
frames, they often fail to respect common sense and physical laws, resulting in
abnormal content. Existing metrics like VideoScore emphasize general quality
but ignore such violations and lack interpretability. A more insightful
approach is using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as interpretable
evaluators, as seen in FactScore. Yet, MLLMs' ability to detect abnormalities
in synthetic videos remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce
VideoHallu, a benchmark featuring synthetic videos from models like Veo2, Sora,
and Kling, paired with expert-designed QA tasks solvable via human-level
reasoning across various categories. We assess several SoTA MLLMs, including
GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen-2.5-VL, and newer models like Video-R1 and
VideoChat-R1. Despite strong real-world performance on MVBench and MovieChat,
these models still hallucinate on basic commonsense and physics tasks in
synthetic settings, underscoring the challenge of hallucination. We further
fine-tune SoTA MLLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on real
and synthetic commonsense/physics data. Results show notable accuracy gains,
especially with counterexample integration, advancing MLLMs' reasoning
capabilities. Our data is available at https://github.com/zli12321/VideoHallu.

TLDR: WorldGenBench是一个评估文本到图像（T2I）模型世界知识和隐式推理能力的基准，提出了知识清单评分来衡量生成图像的语义准确性。实验表明，扩散模型在开源方法中表现最佳，但GPT-4o等专有自回归模型在推理和知识整合方面更强。


<details>

Motivation: 现有T2I模型在处理需要丰富世界知识和隐式推理的提示时表现不佳，这限制了其在真实场景中的应用。

Method: 提出了WorldGenBench基准和知识清单评分，系统评估T2I模型的世界知识基础和推理能力，涵盖人文和自然领域。

Result: 实验结果显示，扩散模型在开源方法中领先，而专有自回归模型（如GPT-4o）在推理和知识整合方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究强调了下一代T2I系统需要更强的理解和推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive
results, yet existing models still struggle with prompts that require rich
world knowledge and implicit reasoning: both of which are critical for
producing semantically accurate, coherent, and contextually appropriate images
in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce
\textbf{WorldGenBench}, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate T2I
models' world knowledge grounding and implicit inferential capabilities,
covering both the humanities and nature domains. We propose the
\textbf{Knowledge Checklist Score}, a structured metric that measures how well
generated images satisfy key semantic expectations. Experiments across 21
state-of-the-art models reveal that while diffusion models lead among
open-source methods, proprietary auto-regressive models like GPT-4o exhibit
significantly stronger reasoning and knowledge integration. Our findings
highlight the need for deeper understanding and inference capabilities in
next-generation T2I systems. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取2D工程图中的关键信息耗时且易错，传统OCR技术难以处理复杂布局和重叠符号，导致非结构化输出。

Method: 使用YOLOv11检测九类关键信息，并通过Donut模型将检测到的OBB裁剪为图像并标记，生成结构化JSON输出。比较了单一模型和类别特定模型的性能。

Result: 单一模型在所有评估指标上均优于类别特定模型，精度达94.77%（GD&T），召回率100%（多数类别），F1分数97.3%，幻觉率降低至5.23%。

Conclusion: 该框架提高了信息提取的准确性，减少了人工干预，适用于高精度制造行业的大规模部署。

Abstract: Accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is
crucial for high-precision manufacturing. Manual extraction is time-consuming
and error-prone, while traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
techniques often struggle with complex layouts and overlapping symbols,
resulting in unstructured outputs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework for structured information
extraction by integrating an oriented bounding box (OBB) detection model with a
transformer-based document parsing model (Donut). An in-house annotated dataset
is used to train YOLOv11 for detecting nine key categories: Geometric
Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T), General Tolerances, Measures, Materials,
Notes, Radii, Surface Roughness, Threads, and Title Blocks. Detected OBBs are
cropped into images and labeled to fine-tune Donut for structured JSON output.
Fine-tuning strategies include a single model trained across all categories and
category-specific models. Results show that the single model consistently
outperforms category-specific ones across all evaluation metrics, achieving
higher precision (94.77% for GD&T), recall (100% for most), and F1 score
(97.3%), while reducing hallucination (5.23%). The proposed framework improves
accuracy, reduces manual effort, and supports scalable deployment in
precision-driven industries.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新型事件表示方法（MET）和两个模块（BFAM和TFM），用于解决RGB-事件融合中的时空和模态不对齐问题，显著提升了语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-事件融合中存在时间、空间和模态三种不对齐问题，现有方法未能有效解决。

Method: 提出Motion-enhanced Event Tensor（MET）将稀疏事件体素转化为密集形式，并引入BFAM和TFM模块处理不对齐问题。

Result: 在两个大规模数据集上，该方法显著优于现有RGB-事件语义分割方法。

Conclusion: MET和提出的模块有效解决了RGB-事件融合中的不对齐问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Event cameras capture motion dynamics, offering a unique modality with great
potential in various computer vision tasks. However, RGB-Event fusion faces
three intrinsic misalignments: (i) temporal, (ii) spatial, and (iii) modal
misalignment. Existing voxel grid representations neglect temporal correlations
between consecutive event windows, and their formulation with simple
accumulation of asynchronous and sparse events is incompatible with the
synchronous and dense nature of RGB modality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a novel event representation, Motion-enhanced Event Tensor (MET), which
transforms sparse event voxels into a dense and temporally coherent form by
leveraging dense optical flows and event temporal features. In addition, we
introduce a Frequency-aware Bidirectional Flow Aggregation Module (BFAM) and a
Temporal Fusion Module (TFM). BFAM leverages the frequency domain and MET to
mitigate modal misalignment, while bidirectional flow aggregation and temporal
fusion mechanisms resolve spatiotemporal misalignment. Experimental results on
two large-scale datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-Event semantic segmentation approaches. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/zyaocoder/BRENet.

Abstract: Remote sensing enables a wide range of critical applications such as land
cover and land use mapping, crop yield prediction, and environmental
monitoring. Advances in satellite technology have expanded remote sensing
datasets, yet high-performance segmentation models remain dependent on
extensive labeled data, challenged by annotation scarcity and variability
across sensors, illumination, and geography. Domain adaptation offers a
promising solution to improve model generalization. This paper introduces a
domain generalization approach to leveraging emerging geospatial foundation
models by combining soft-alignment pseudo-labeling with source-to-target
generative pre-training. We further provide new mathematical insights into
MAE-based generative learning for domain-invariant feature learning.
Experiments with hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing datasets
confirm our method's effectiveness in enhancing adaptability and segmentation.

Motivation: 疼痛影响广泛人群，准确评估对疼痛管理至关重要。自动评估系统可提供持续监测和决策支持。

Method: PainFormer基于多任务学习，训练于14个任务/数据集，共1090万样本，结合Embedding-Mixer模块进行最终评估。

Abstract: Pain is a manifold condition that impacts a significant percentage of the
population. Accurate and reliable pain evaluation for the people suffering is
crucial to developing effective and advanced pain management protocols.
Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support
decision-making processes, ultimately aiming to alleviate distress and prevent
functionality decline. This study introduces PainFormer, a vision foundation
model based on multi-task learning principles trained simultaneously on 14
tasks/datasets with a total of 10.9 million samples. Functioning as an
embedding extractor for various input modalities, the foundation model provides
feature representations to the Embedding-Mixer, a transformer-based module that
performs the final pain assessment. Extensive experiments employing behavioral
modalities-including RGB, synthetic thermal, and estimated depth videos-and
physiological modalities such as ECG, EMG, GSR, and fNIRS revealed that
PainFormer effectively extracts high-quality embeddings from diverse input
modalities. The proposed framework is evaluated on two pain datasets, BioVid
and AI4Pain, and directly compared to 73 different methodologies documented in
the literature. Experiments conducted in unimodal and multimodal settings
demonstrate state-of-the-art performances across modalities and pave the way
toward general-purpose models for automatic pain assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB视频无法捕捉任务演示中的细粒度意图和环境因素，限制了视觉语言模型的推理能力。

Method: MICA框架整合眼动和语音信号，将演示分解为子任务，提取关键帧和字幕以捕捉意图和用户线索。

Result: 多模态信号显著提升响应质量，眼动信号单独达到语音性能的93%，两者结合效果最佳。

Conclusion: 多模态信号对真实世界AI任务辅助具有重要价值，需开发适应性强的多模态模型。

Abstract: A person's demonstration often serves as a key reference for others learning
the same task. However, RGB video, the dominant medium for representing these
demonstrations, often fails to capture fine-grained contextual cues such as
intent, safety-critical environmental factors, and subtle preferences embedded
in human behavior. This sensory gap fundamentally limits the ability of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) to reason about why actions occur and how they should
adapt to individual users. To address this, we introduce MICA (Multimodal
Interactive Contextualized Assistance), a framework that improves
conversational agents for task assistance by integrating eye gaze and speech
cues. MICA segments demonstrations into meaningful sub-tasks and extracts
keyframes and captions that capture fine-grained intent and user-specific cues,
enabling richer contextual grounding for visual question answering. Evaluations
on questions derived from real-time chat-assisted task replication show that
multimodal cues significantly improve response quality over frame-based
retrieval. Notably, gaze cues alone achieves 93% of speech performance, and
their combination yields the highest accuracy. Task type determines the
effectiveness of implicit (gaze) vs. explicit (speech) cues, underscoring the
need for adaptable multimodal models. These results highlight the limitations
of frame-based context and demonstrate the value of multimodal signals for
real-world AI task assistance.

Motivation: 现有方法在视频时间分辨率和因果依赖建模方面存在不足，TEMPURA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: TEMPURA采用两阶段训练：1) 掩码事件预测和因果推理；2) 视频分割和密集标注。

Result: 在时间定位和高光检测任务中，TEMPURA优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合因果推理和细粒度时间分割可显著提升视频理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding causal event relationships and achieving fine-grained temporal
grounding in videos remain challenging for vision-language models. Existing
methods either compress video tokens to reduce temporal resolution, or treat
videos as unsegmented streams, which obscures fine-grained event boundaries and
limits the modeling of causal dependencies. We propose TEMPURA (Temporal Event
Masked Prediction and Understanding for Reasoning in Action), a two-stage
training framework that enhances video temporal understanding. TEMPURA first
applies masked event prediction reasoning to reconstruct missing events and
generate step-by-step causal explanations from dense event annotations, drawing
inspiration from effective infilling techniques. TEMPURA then learns to perform
video segmentation and dense captioning to decompose videos into
non-overlapping events with detailed, timestamp-aligned descriptions. We train
TEMPURA on VER, a large-scale dataset curated by us that comprises 1M training
instances and 500K videos with temporally aligned event descriptions and
structured reasoning steps. Experiments on temporal grounding and highlight
detection benchmarks demonstrate that TEMPURA outperforms strong baseline
models, confirming that integrating causal reasoning with fine-grained temporal
segmentation leads to improved video understanding.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of advanced low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites in large
constellations is positioning space assets as key to the future, enabling
global internet access and relay systems for deep space missions. A solution to
the challenge is effective space object detection (SOD) for collision
assessment and avoidance. In SOD, an LEO satellite must detect other satellites
and objects with high precision and minimal delay. This paper investigates the
feasibility and effectiveness of employing vision sensors for SOD tasks based
on deep learning (DL) models. It introduces models based on the
Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layer, Vision Transformer (ViT), and the
Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN) and evaluates their
performance under SOD scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed
models achieve mean average precision at intersection over union threshold 0.5
(mAP50) scores of up to 0.751 and mean average precision averaged over
intersection over union thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP50:95) scores of up to
0.280. Compared to the baseline GELAN-t model, the proposed GELAN-ViT-SE model
increases the average mAP50 from 0.721 to 0.751, improves the mAP50:95 from
0.266 to 0.274, reduces giga floating point operations (GFLOPs) from 7.3 to

Abstract: The pattern analysis of tree structure holds significant scientific value for
genetic breeding and forestry management. The current trunk and branch
extraction technologies are mainly LiDAR-based or UAV-based. The former
approaches obtain high-precision 3D data, but its equipment cost is high and
the three-dimensional (3D) data processing is complex. The latter approaches
efficiently capture canopy information, but they miss the 3-D structure of
trees. In order to deal with the branch information extraction from the complex
background interference and occlusion, this work proposes a novel WaveInst
instance segmentation framework, involving a discrete wavelet transform, to
enhance multi-scale edge information for accurately improving tree structure
extraction. Experimental results of the proposed model show superior
performance on SynthTree43k, CaneTree100, Urban Street and our PoplarDataset.
Moreover, we present a new Phenotypic dataset PoplarDataset, which is dedicated
to extract tree structure and pattern analysis from artificial forest. The
proposed method achieves a mean average precision of 49.6 and 24.3 for the
structure extraction of mature and juvenile trees, respectively, surpassing the
existing state-of-the-art method by 9.9. Furthermore, by in tegrating the
segmentation model within the regression model, we accurately achieve
significant tree grown parameters, such as the location of trees, the
diameter-at-breast-height of individual trees, and the plant height, from 2D
images directly. This study provides a scientific and plenty of data for tree
structure analysis in related to the phenotype research, offering a platform
for the significant applications in precision forestry, ecological monitoring,
and intelligent breeding.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证了SSOT的有效性。

Conclusion: SSOT通过类条件分布匹配和神经网络优化，显著提升了PDA任务的性能。

Abstract: Visual domain adaptation aims to learn discriminative and domain-invariant
representation for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging knowledge from a
labeled source domain. Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a general and
practical scenario in which the target label space is a subset of the source
one. The challenges of PDA exist due to not only domain shift but also the
non-identical label spaces of domains. In this paper, a Soft-masked Semi-dual
Optimal Transport (SSOT) method is proposed to deal with the PDA problem.
Specifically, the class weights of domains are estimated, and then a reweighed
source domain is constructed, which is favorable in conducting
class-conditional distribution matching with the target domain. A soft-masked
transport distance matrix is constructed by category predictions, which will
enhance the class-oriented representation ability of optimal transport in the
shared feature space. To deal with large-scale optimal transport problems, the
semi-dual formulation of the entropy-regularized Kantorovich problem is
employed since it can be optimized by gradient-based algorithms. Further, a
neural network is exploited to approximate the Kantorovich potential due to its
strong fitting ability. This network parametrization also allows the
generalization of the dual variable outside the supports of the input
distribution. The SSOT model is built upon neural networks, which can be
optimized alternately in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are
conducted on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of SSOT.

quality components, enhancing interpretability. A clinician dashboard displays
task scores, execution times, and quality assessments. We conducted a study

Abstract: Efficiently adapting large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for

and task-specific adaptation. Existing methods often overlook valuable
structural information within the VLM's latent space. We introduce a
topology-aware tuning approach integrating Representation Topology Divergence

topological structures of visual and text representations using a combined RTD

few-shot performance. We optimize only lightweight Task Residual parameters,
effectively leveraging topological information. Across 6 diverse benchmark

Abstract: The widespread integration of face recognition technologies into various
applications (e.g., access control and personalized advertising) necessitates a
critical emphasis on fairness. While previous efforts have focused on
demographic fairness, the fairness of individual biological face components
remains unexplored. In this paper, we focus on face component fairness, a
fairness notion defined by biological face features. To our best knowledge, our
work is the first work to mitigate bias of face attribute prediction at the
biological feature level. In this work, we identify two key challenges in
optimizing face component fairness: attribute label scarcity and attribute
inter-dependencies, both of which limit the effectiveness of bias mitigation
from previous approaches. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{N}etwork-informed \textbf{M}eta \textbf{R}eweighting (BNMR), which
incorporates a Bayesian Network calibrator to guide an adaptive
meta-learning-based sample reweighting process. During the training process of
our approach, the Bayesian Network calibrator dynamically tracks model bias and
encodes prior probabilities for face component attributes to overcome the above
challenges. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we conduct extensive
experiments on a large-scale real-world human face dataset. Our results show
that BNMR is able to consistently outperform recent face bias mitigation
baselines. Moreover, our results suggest a positive impact of face component
fairness on the commonly considered demographic fairness (e.g.,
\textit{gender}). Our findings pave the way for new research avenues on face
component fairness, suggesting that face component fairness could serve as a
potential surrogate objective for demographic fairness. The code for our work
is publicly
available~\footnote{https://github.com/yliuaa/BNMR-FairCompFace.git}.

Conclusion: CXR-TextInter展示了将视觉信息结构化并结合领域知识后，LLM在医学图像AI中的潜力。

Abstract: Automated interpretation of chest X-rays (CXR) is a critical task with the
potential to significantly improve clinical workflow and patient care. While
recent advances in multimodal foundation models have shown promise, effectively
leveraging the full power of large language models (LLMs) for this visual task
remains an underexplored area. This paper introduces CXR-TextInter, a novel
framework that repurposes powerful text-centric LLMs for CXR interpretation by
operating solely on a rich, structured textual representation of the image
content, generated by an upstream image analysis pipeline. We augment this
LLM-centric approach with an integrated medical knowledge module to enhance
clinical reasoning. To facilitate training and evaluation, we developed the
MediInstruct-CXR dataset, containing structured image representations paired
with diverse, clinically relevant instruction-response examples, and the
CXR-ClinEval benchmark for comprehensive assessment across various
interpretation tasks. Extensive experiments on CXR-ClinEval demonstrate that
CXR-TextInter achieves state-of-the-art quantitative performance across
pathology detection, report generation, and visual question answering,
surpassing existing multimodal foundation models. Ablation studies confirm the
critical contribution of the knowledge integration module. Furthermore, blinded
human evaluation by board-certified radiologists shows a significant preference
for the clinical quality of outputs generated by CXR-TextInter. Our work
validates an alternative paradigm for medical image AI, showcasing the
potential of harnessing advanced LLM capabilities when visual information is
effectively structured and domain knowledge is integrated.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于意图的视觉语言模型（ICVL），通过结合视觉数据和语言模型的优势，解决了单模态方法在长期动作预测中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖视频数据或文本输入，前者缺乏先验知识，后者信息损失严重。因此，需要一种多模态方法以充分利用视觉语义信息和语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出ICVL模型，通过视觉语言模型（VLM）从视频中推断意图，并将其与视觉特征融合，再输入大型语言模型（LLM）进行动作预测。同时设计了基于视觉和文本相似性的示例选择策略。

Result: 在Ego4D、EPIC-Kitchens-55和EGTEA GAZE+数据集上取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ICVL模型通过多模态融合和意图增强，显著提升了长期动作预测的效果。

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation (LTA) aims to predict future actions over an
extended period. Previous approaches primarily focus on learning exclusively
from video data but lack prior knowledge. Recent researches leverage large
language models (LLMs) by utilizing text-based inputs which suffer severe
information loss. To tackle these limitations single-modality methods face, we
propose a novel Intention-Conditioned Vision-Language (ICVL) model in this
study that fully leverages the rich semantic information of visual data and the
powerful reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Considering intention as a high-level
concept guiding the evolution of actions, we first propose to employ a
vision-language model (VLM) to infer behavioral intentions as comprehensive
textual features directly from video inputs. The inferred intentions are then
fused with visual features through a multi-modality fusion strategy, resulting
in intention-enhanced visual representations. These enhanced visual
representations, along with textual prompts, are fed into LLM for future action
anticipation. Furthermore, we propose an effective example selection strategy
jointly considers visual and textual similarities, providing more relevant and
informative examples for in-context learning. Extensive experiments with
state-of-the-art performance on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and EGTEA GAZE+
datasets fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed
method.

Motivation: 解决3D交互式分割中稀疏点击泛化不足和预测不确定性量化未充分探索的问题。

Method: 提出NPISeg3D框架，采用分层潜在变量结构（场景特定和对象特定变量）和概率原型调制器，增强少样本泛化和不确定性量化。

Conclusion: NPISeg3D通过分层结构和概率调制器，显著提升了3D交互式分割的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Interactive 3D segmentation has emerged as a promising solution for
generating accurate object masks in complex 3D scenes by incorporating
user-provided clicks. However, two critical challenges remain underexplored:
(1) effectively generalizing from sparse user clicks to produce accurate
segmentation, and (2) quantifying predictive uncertainty to help users identify
unreliable regions. In this work, we propose NPISeg3D, a novel probabilistic
framework that builds upon Neural Processes (NPs) to address these challenges.
Specifically, NPISeg3D introduces a hierarchical latent variable structure with
scene-specific and object-specific latent variables to enhance few-shot
generalization by capturing both global context and object-specific
characteristics. Additionally, we design a probabilistic prototype modulator
that adaptively modulates click prototypes with object-specific latent
variables, improving the model's ability to capture object-aware context and
quantify predictive uncertainty. Experiments on four 3D point cloud datasets
demonstrate that NPISeg3D achieves superior segmentation performance with fewer
clicks while providing reliable uncertainty estimations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中相机姿态控制的精确性和灵活性挑战，以提升场景动态模拟的准确性。

Method: 结合自监督深度和姿态读取，利用结构从运动原理，通过光度量变形损失和反向变形步骤优化姿态估计。

Result: 在自动驾驶和通用视频数据集上显著提升结构理解和运动推理能力。

Conclusion: PosePilot为生成世界模型中的相机姿态控制设定了新标准，实现了物理一致的可靠视角合成。

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) systems have highlighted the
potential of world models in achieving robust and generalizable performance
across both ordinary and challenging driving conditions. However, a key
challenge remains: precise and flexible camera pose control, which is crucial
for accurate viewpoint transformation and realistic simulation of scene
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PosePilot, a lightweight yet powerful
framework that significantly enhances camera pose controllability in generative
world models. Drawing inspiration from self-supervised depth estimation,
PosePilot leverages structure-from-motion principles to establish a tight
coupling between camera pose and video generation. Specifically, we incorporate
self-supervised depth and pose readouts, allowing the model to infer depth and
relative camera motion directly from video sequences. These outputs drive
pose-aware frame warping, guided by a photometric warping loss that enforces
geometric consistency across synthesized frames. To further refine camera pose
estimation, we introduce a reverse warping step and a pose regression loss,
improving viewpoint precision and adaptability. Extensive experiments on
autonomous driving and general-domain video datasets demonstrate that PosePilot
significantly enhances structural understanding and motion reasoning in both
diffusion-based and auto-regressive world models. By steering camera pose with
self-supervised depth, PosePilot sets a new benchmark for pose controllability,
enabling physically consistent, reliable viewpoint synthesis in generative
world models.

*Seong Hyeon Park,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种新模型MMP，通过前馈方式估计动态场景的3D几何，显著提升了点图预测的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景中3D几何估计的挑战在于物体运动和现有模型只能预测部分属性（如深度或点图），且多帧下噪声问题严重。

Method: 基于Siamese架构，引入轨迹编码模块，将点动态投影到每帧的表示中，提升动态场景的表达能力。

Result: MMP在点图预测中达到最先进水平，回归误差降低15.1%。

Conclusion: MMP通过前馈方式有效解决了动态场景几何估计的挑战，显著提升了预测质量。

Abstract: In monocular videos that capture dynamic scenes, estimating the 3D geometry
of video contents has been a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Specifically, the task is significantly challenged by the object motion, where
existing models are limited to predict only partial attributes of the dynamic
scenes, such as depth or pointmaps spanning only over a pair of frames. Since
these attributes are inherently noisy under multiple frames, test-time global
optimizations are often employed to fully recover the geometry, which is liable
to failure and incurs heavy inference costs. To address the challenge, we
present a new model, coined MMP, to estimate the geometry in a feed-forward
manner, which produces a dynamic pointmap representation that evolves over
multiple frames. Specifically, based on the recent Siamese architecture, we
introduce a new trajectory encoding module to project point-wise dynamics on
the representation for each frame, which can provide significantly improved
expressiveness for dynamic scenes. In our experiments, we find MMP can achieve
state-of-the-art quality in feed-forward pointmap prediction, e.g., 15.1%
enhancement in the regression error.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Llambda的系统，旨在解决大视觉语言模型（LVLM）在低分辨率数据理解上的不足，通过结合有限标注数据和大量未标注数据生成高质量伪标签，并利用物理知识引导的标注器优化伪标签，最终通过LoRA高效微调提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLM主要针对高分辨率数据（如RGB图像），难以有效理解低分辨率数据（如深度、热成像等）。传统方法需要大量人工标注，成本高昂。因此，研究提出了一种节省劳动力的系统Llambda，以支持低分辨率人类行为理解（HBU）。

Method: 1. 提出对比导向数据标注器，通过对比学习从低分辨率视频中提取行为相关信息并生成高质量伪标签。2. 提出物理知识引导的标注器，利用时空一致性检查优化伪标签。3. 采用LoRA高效微调技术，使LVLM适应低分辨率数据。

Result: 在区域级真实测试平台和三个低分辨率数据集上的实验表明，Llambda在平均Bert-Score上优于现有LVLM系统，最高提升40.03%。

Conclusion: Llambda通过结合伪标签生成和物理知识引导的优化，显著提升了LVLM在低分辨率数据上的表现，同时降低了标注成本，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer the
potential to surpass conventional labeling by generating richer, more detailed
descriptions of on-device human behavior understanding (HBU) in low-resolution
vision systems, such as depth, thermal, and infrared. However, existing large
vision language model (LVLM) approaches are unable to understand low-resolution
data well as they are primarily designed for high-resolution data, such as RGB
images. A quick fixing approach is to caption a large amount of low-resolution
data, but it requires a significant amount of labor-intensive annotation
efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel, labor-saving system, Llambda,
designed to support low-resolution HBU. The core idea is to leverage limited
labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to guide LLMs in generating
informative captions, which can be combined with raw data to effectively
fine-tune LVLM models for understanding low-resolution videos in HBU. First, we
propose a Contrastive-Oriented Data Labeler, which can capture
behavior-relevant information from long, low-resolution videos and generate
high-quality pseudo labels for unlabeled data via contrastive learning. Second,
we propose a Physical-Knowledge Guided Captioner, which utilizes spatial and
temporal consistency checks to mitigate errors in pseudo labels. Therefore, it
can improve LLMs' understanding of sequential data and then generate
high-quality video captions. Finally, to ensure on-device deployability, we
employ LoRA-based efficient fine-tuning to adapt LVLMs for low-resolution data.
We evaluate Llambda using a region-scale real-world testbed and three distinct
low-resolution datasets, and the experiments show that Llambda outperforms
several state-of-the-art LVLM systems up to $40.03\%$ on average Bert-Score.

Motivation: 现有方法仅支持单人自说自话的手势生成，忽视了两人交互对话的实际需求，且缺乏高质量数据集。

Method: 提出Co$^3$Gesture框架，包含两个协同生成分支和时序交互模块（TIM），通过互注意力机制增强手势协调性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在GES-Inter数据集上优于现有模型，能生成生动且连贯的手势。

Conclusion: 论文填补了两人交互手势生成的空白，提供了数据集和开源代码，推动了虚拟角色动画的发展。

Abstract: Generating gestures from human speech has gained tremendous progress in
animating virtual avatars. While the existing methods enable synthesizing
gestures cooperated by individual self-talking, they overlook the practicality
of concurrent gesture modeling with two-person interactive conversations.
Moreover, the lack of high-quality datasets with concurrent co-speech gestures
also limits handling this issue. To fulfill this goal, we first construct a
large-scale concurrent co-speech gesture dataset that contains more than 7M
frames for diverse two-person interactive posture sequences, dubbed GES-Inter.
Additionally, we propose Co$^3$Gesture, a novel framework that enables coherent
concurrent co-speech gesture synthesis including two-person interactive
movements. Considering the asymmetric body dynamics of two speakers, our
framework is built upon two cooperative generation branches conditioned on
separated speaker audio. Specifically, to enhance the coordination of human
postures with respect to corresponding speaker audios while interacting with
the conversational partner, we present a Temporal Interaction Module (TIM). TIM
can effectively model the temporal association representation between two
speakers' gesture sequences as interaction guidance and fuse it into the
concurrent gesture generation. Then, we devise a mutual attention mechanism to
further holistically boost learning dependencies of interacted concurrent
motions, thereby enabling us to generate vivid and coherent gestures. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models
on our newly collected GES-Inter dataset. The dataset and source code are

Motivation: 手术工作流识别对自动化任务、决策支持和培训新手外科医生至关重要，但数据损坏（如遮挡或存储传输问题）会导致性能下降。

Method: 结合视觉和运动学数据，提出多模态图表示网络（GRAD），通过对抗特征解耦和图建模增强鲁棒性，并设计了上下文校准解码器。

Result: 实验表明该方法在数据损坏和领域偏移下表现优异，具有稳定性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂动态手术场景中的自动化工作流识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Surgical workflow recognition is vital for automating tasks, supporting
decision-making, and training novice surgeons, ultimately improving patient
safety and standardizing procedures. However, data corruption can lead to
performance degradation due to issues like occlusion from bleeding or smoke in
surgical scenes and problems with data storage and transmission. In this case,
we explore a robust graph-based multimodal approach to integrating vision and
kinematic data to enhance accuracy and reliability. Vision data captures
dynamic surgical scenes, while kinematic data provides precise movement
information, overcoming limitations of visual recognition under adverse
conditions. We propose a multimodal Graph Representation network with
Adversarial feature Disentanglement (GRAD) for robust surgical workflow
recognition in challenging scenarios with domain shifts or corrupted data.
Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal Disentanglement Graph Network that
captures fine-grained visual information while explicitly modeling the complex
relationships between vision and kinematic embeddings through graph-based
message modeling. To align feature spaces across modalities, we propose a
Vision-Kinematic Adversarial framework that leverages adversarial training to
reduce modality gaps and improve feature consistency. Furthermore, we design a
Contextual Calibrated Decoder, incorporating temporal and contextual priors to
enhance robustness against domain shifts and corrupted data. Extensive
comparative and ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model
and proposed modules. Moreover, our robustness experiments show that our method
effectively handles data corruption during storage and transmission, exhibiting
excellent stability and robustness. Our approach aims to advance automated
surgical workflow recognition, addressing the complexities and dynamism
inherent in surgical procedures.

Abstract: Web-based educational videos offer flexible learning opportunities and are
becoming increasingly popular. However, improving user engagement and knowledge
retention remains a challenge. Automatically generated questions can activate
learners and support their knowledge acquisition. Further, they can help
teachers and learners assess their understanding. While large language and
vision-language models have been employed in various tasks, their application
to question generation for educational videos remains underexplored. In this
paper, we investigate the capabilities of current vision-language models for
generating learning-oriented questions for educational video content. We assess
(1) out-of-the-box models' performance; (2) fine-tuning effects on
content-specific question generation; (3) the impact of different video
modalities on question quality; and (4) in a qualitative study, question
relevance, answerability, and difficulty levels of generated questions. Our
findings delineate the capabilities of current vision-language models,
highlighting the need for fine-tuning and addressing challenges in question
diversity and relevance. We identify requirements for future multimodal

Result: 仅需3张输入图像，30秒内完成高精度重建，显著提升算法在机器人平台的应用性。

Conclusion: AquaGS克服了传统方法的局限性，准确模拟水下光学现象，适用于实时场景。

Abstract: Underwater scene reconstruction is a critical tech-nology for underwater
operations, enabling the generation of 3D models from images captured by
underwater platforms. However, the quality of underwater images is often
degraded due to medium interference, which limits the effectiveness of
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pose estimation, leading to subsequent
reconstruction failures. Additionally, SfM methods typically operate at slower
speeds, further hindering their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce AquaGS, an SfM-free underwater scene reconstruction model
based on the SeaThru algorithm, which facilitates rapid and accurate separation
of scene details and medium features. Our approach initializes Gaussians by
integrating state-of-the-art multi-view stereo (MVS) technology, employs
implicit Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for rendering translucent media and
utilizes the latest explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to render
object surfaces, which effectively addresses the limitations of traditional
methods and accurately simulates underwater optical phenomena. Experimental
results on the data set and the robot platform show that our model can complete
high-precision reconstruction in 30 seconds with only 3 image inputs,
significantly enhancing the practical application of the algorithm in robotic
platforms.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在生成准确性上显著优于现有方法，同时大幅减少计算成本和内存开销。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于资源受限设备，为高效3D全身生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: To have a seamless user experience on immersive AR/VR applications, the
importance of efficient and effective Neural Network (NN) models is undeniable,
since missing body parts that cannot be captured by limited sensors should be
generated using these models for a complete 3D full-body reconstruction in
virtual environment. However, the state-of-the-art NN-models are typically
computational expensive and they leverage longer sequences of sparse tracking
inputs to generate full-body movements by capturing temporal context.
Inevitably, longer sequences increase the computation overhead and introduce
noise in longer temporal dependencies that adversely affect the generation
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP)-based method that enhances the overall performance while balancing the
computational cost and memory overhead for efficient 3D full-body generation.
Precisely, we introduce a NN-mechanism that divides the longer sequence of
inputs into smaller temporal windows. Later, the current motion is merged with
the information from these windows through latent representations to utilize
the past context for the generation. Our experiments demonstrate that
generation accuracy of our method with this NN-mechanism is significantly
improved compared to the state-of-the-art methods while greatly reducing
computational costs and memory overhead, making our method suitable for
resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Developing accurate and reliable models for forest types mapping is critical
to support efforts for halting deforestation and for biodiversity conservation
(such as European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)). This work introduces
ForTy, a benchmark for global-scale FORest TYpes mapping using multi-temporal
satellite data1. The benchmark comprises 200,000 time series of image patches,
each consisting of Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, climate, and elevation data. Each
time series captures variations at monthly or seasonal cadence. Per-pixel
annotations, including forest types and other land use classes, support image
segmentation tasks. Unlike most existing land use products that often
categorize all forest areas into a single class, our benchmark differentiates
between three forest types classes: natural forest, planted forest, and tree
crops. By leveraging multiple public data sources, we achieve global coverage
with this benchmark. We evaluate the forest types dataset using several
baseline models, including convolution neural networks and transformer-based
models. Additionally, we propose a novel transformer-based model specifically
designed to handle multi-modal, multi-temporal satellite data for forest types
mapping. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses
the baseline models in performance.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了类别和实例的区分问题，显著提升了弱监督3D视觉定位的准确性。

Abstract: The 3D weakly-supervised visual grounding task aims to localize oriented 3D
boxes in point clouds based on natural language descriptions without requiring
annotations to guide model learning. This setting presents two primary
challenges: category-level ambiguity and instance-level complexity.
Category-level ambiguity arises from representing objects of fine-grained
categories in a highly sparse point cloud format, making category distinction
challenging. Instance-level complexity stems from multiple instances of the
same category coexisting in a scene, leading to distractions during grounding.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel weakly-supervised grounding
approach that explicitly differentiates between categories and instances. In
the category-level branch, we utilize extensive category knowledge from a
pre-trained external detector to align object proposal features with
sentence-level category features, thereby enhancing category awareness. In the
instance-level branch, we utilize spatial relationship descriptions from
language queries to refine object proposal features, ensuring clear
differentiation among objects. These designs enable our model to accurately
identify target-category objects while distinguishing instances within the same
category. Compared to previous methods, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on three widely used benchmarks: Nr3D, Sr3D, and ScanRef.

Abstract: Collecting large-scale crop disease images in the field is labor-intensive
and time-consuming. Generative models (GMs) offer an alternative by creating
synthetic samples that resemble real-world images. However, existing research
primarily relies on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)-based image-to-image

agriculture. Therefore, this research explores a multi-modal text-to-image
approach for generating synthetic crop disease images and is the first to
provide computational benchmarking in this context. We trained three Stable
Diffusion (SD) variants-SDXL, SD3.5M (medium), and SD3.5L (large)-and
fine-tuned them using Dreambooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning
techniques to enhance generalization. SD3.5M outperformed the others, with an
average memory usage of 18 GB, power consumption of 180 W, and total energy use
of 1.02 kWh/500 images (0.002 kWh per image) during inference task. Our results
demonstrate SD3.5M's ability to generate 500 synthetic images from just 36
in-field samples in 1.5 hours. We recommend SD3.5M for efficient crop disease

TLDR: 论文提出CVVNet，一种针对跨垂直视角步态识别的频率聚合架构，通过多尺度特征提取和动态门控聚合机制，显著提升了识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有步态识别方法在跨垂直视角场景下表现不佳，因视角变化导致特征变形和自遮挡，传统CNN和自注意力机制难以有效处理。

Method: 提出CVVNet，包含高-低频率提取模块（HLFE）和动态门控聚合（DGA）机制，通过多尺度注意门控聚合（MSAGA）模块整合特征。

Conclusion: CVVNet通过频率聚合和多尺度特征处理，显著提升了跨垂直视角步态识别的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Gait recognition enables contact-free, long-range person identification that
is robust to clothing variations and non-cooperative scenarios. While existing
methods perform well in controlled indoor environments, they struggle with
cross-vertical view scenarios, where surveillance angles vary significantly in
elevation. Our experiments show up to 60\% accuracy degradation in low-to-high
vertical view settings due to severe deformations and self-occlusions of key
anatomical features. Current CNN and self-attention-based methods fail to
effectively handle these challenges, due to their reliance on single-scale
convolutions or simplistic attention mechanisms that lack effective
multi-frequency feature integration. To tackle this challenge, we propose
CVVNet (Cross-Vertical-View Network), a frequency aggregation architecture
specifically designed for robust cross-vertical-view gait recognition. CVVNet
employs a High-Low Frequency Extraction module (HLFE) that adopts parallel
multi-scale convolution/max-pooling path and self-attention path as high- and
low-frequency mixers for effective multi-frequency feature extraction from
input silhouettes. We also introduce the Dynamic Gated Aggregation (DGA)
mechanism to adaptively adjust the fusion ratio of high- and low-frequency
features. The integration of our core Multi-Scale Attention Gated Aggregation
(MSAGA) module, HLFE and DGA enables CVVNet to effectively handle distortions
from view changes, significantly improving the recognition robustness across
different vertical views. Experimental results show that our CVVNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with $8.6\%$ improvement on DroneGait and $2\%$
on Gait3D compared with the best existing methods.

Abstract: In this era, the success of large language models and text-to-image models
can be attributed to the driving force of large-scale datasets. However, in the
realm of 3D vision, while significant progress has been achieved in
object-centric tasks through large-scale datasets like Objaverse and MVImgNet,
human-centric tasks have seen limited advancement, largely due to the absence
of a comparable large-scale human dataset. To bridge this gap, we present
MVHumanNet++, a dataset that comprises multi-view human action sequences of
4,500 human identities. The primary focus of our work is on collecting human
data that features a large number of diverse identities and everyday clothing
using multi-view human capture systems, which facilitates easily scalable data
collection. Our dataset contains 9,000 daily outfits, 60,000 motion sequences
and 645 million frames with extensive annotations, including human masks,
camera parameters, 2D and 3D keypoints, SMPL/SMPLX parameters, and
corresponding textual descriptions. Additionally, the proposed MVHumanNet++
dataset is enhanced with newly processed normal maps and depth maps,
significantly expanding its applicability and utility for advanced
human-centric research. To explore the potential of our proposed MVHumanNet++
dataset in various 2D and 3D visual tasks, we conducted several pilot studies
to demonstrate the performance improvements and effective applications enabled
by the scale provided by MVHumanNet++. As the current largest-scale 3D human
dataset, we hope that the release of MVHumanNet++ dataset with annotations will
foster further innovations in the domain of 3D human-centric tasks at scale.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但在联邦学习环境中难以保持跨人口群体的公平性。

Method: 结合联邦学习与公平提示调优，包括跨层人口公平提示（CDFP）、人口子空间正交投影（DSOP）和公平感知提示融合（FPF）。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，方法平均减少45%的人口差异，同时任务性能保持在最优结果的6%以内。

Conclusion: FVL-FP为隐私保护多模态系统中确保跨人口群体公平性能提供了参数高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
multimodal tasks but face challenges in maintaining fairness across demographic
groups, particularly when deployed in federated learning (FL) environments.
This paper addresses the critical issue of group fairness in federated VLMs by
introducing FVL-FP, a novel framework that combines FL with fair prompt tuning
techniques. We focus on mitigating demographic biases while preserving model
performance through three innovative components: (1) Cross-Layer Demographic
Fair Prompting (CDFP), which adjusts potentially biased embeddings through
counterfactual regularization; (2) Demographic Subspace Orthogonal Projection
(DSOP), which removes demographic bias in image representations by mapping fair
prompt text to group subspaces; and (3) Fair-aware Prompt Fusion (FPF), which
dynamically balances client contributions based on both performance and
fairness metrics. Extensive evaluations across four benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our approach reduces demographic disparity by an average of
45\% compared to standard FL approaches, while maintaining task performance
within 6\% of state-of-the-art results. FVL-FP effectively addresses the
challenges of non-IID data distributions in federated settings and introduces
minimal computational overhead while providing significant fairness benefits.
Our work presents a parameter-efficient solution to the critical challenge of
ensuring equitable performance across demographic groups in privacy-preserving
multimodal systems.

Conclusion: DualDiff通过多模态信息融合和精细控制，显著提升了驾驶场景重建的准确性和保真度。

Abstract: Accurate and high-fidelity driving scene reconstruction relies on fully
leveraging scene information as conditioning. However, existing approaches,
which primarily use 3D bounding boxes and binary maps for foreground and
background control, fall short in capturing the complexity of the scene and
integrating multi-modal information. In this paper, we propose DualDiff, a
dual-branch conditional diffusion model designed to enhance multi-view driving
scene generation. We introduce Occupancy Ray Sampling (ORS), a semantic-rich 3D
representation, alongside numerical driving scene representation, for
comprehensive foreground and background control. To improve cross-modal
information integration, we propose a Semantic Fusion Attention (SFA) mechanism
that aligns and fuses features across modalities. Furthermore, we design a
foreground-aware masked (FGM) loss to enhance the generation of tiny objects.
DualDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in FID score, as well as
consistently better results in downstream BEV segmentation and 3D object
detection tasks.

Method: 提出CMAWRNet，结合纹理-结构分解块、四元数变换架构和注意力融合块，并引入四元数相似性损失函数。

Result: 在基准数据集和真实图像上，CMAWRNet在去除多种天气影响方面优于现有方法，并提升了下游任务性能。

Conclusion: CMAWRNet首次将分解方法应用于通用天气去除任务，展示了其在处理复杂天气条件下的有效性。

Abstract: Images used in real-world applications such as image or video retrieval,
outdoor surveillance, and autonomous driving suffer from poor weather
conditions. When designing robust computer vision systems, removing adverse
weather such as haze, rain, and snow is a significant problem. Recently,
deep-learning methods offered a solution for a single type of degradation.
Current state-of-the-art universal methods struggle with combinations of
degradations, such as haze and rain-streak. Few algorithms have been developed
that perform well when presented with images containing multiple adverse
weather conditions. This work focuses on developing an efficient solution for
multiple adverse weather removal using a unified quaternion neural architecture
called CMAWRNet. It is based on a novel texture-structure decomposition block,
a novel lightweight encoder-decoder quaternion transformer architecture, and an
attentive fusion block with low-light correction. We also introduce a
quaternion similarity loss function to preserve color information better. The
quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the current state-of-the-art
benchmarking datasets and real-world images shows the performance advantages of
the proposed CMAWRNet compared to other state-of-the-art weather removal
approaches dealing with multiple weather artifacts. Extensive computer
simulations validate that CMAWRNet improves the performance of downstream
applications such as object detection. This is the first time the decomposition
approach has been applied to the universal weather removal task.

TLDR: UDS（Unified Distillation Sampling）是一种统一3D生成和编辑的方法，通过优化SDS的梯度项，同时支持生成和编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDS（Score Distillation Sampling）在文本到3D生成中表现突出，但缺乏编辑现有3D资产的能力；而支持编辑的SDS变体又无法有效生成新资产。

Method: UDS通过统一SDS及其变体中的梯度项，提出了一种同时支持生成和编辑的方法。

Result: 实验表明，UDS在生成更丰富的3D资产和编辑任务中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: UDS填补了3D生成与编辑之间的空白，为两者提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has emerged as a prominent method for
text-to-3D generation by leveraging the strengths of 2D diffusion models.
However, SDS is limited to generation tasks and lacks the capability to edit
existing 3D assets. Conversely, variants of SDS that introduce editing
capabilities often can not generate new 3D assets effectively. In this work, we
observe that the processes of generation and editing within SDS and its
variants have unified underlying gradient terms. Building on this insight, we
propose Unified Distillation Sampling (UDS), a method that seamlessly
integrates both the generation and editing of 3D assets. Essentially, UDS
refines the gradient terms used in vanilla SDS methods, unifying them to
support both tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UDS not only
outperforms baseline methods in generating 3D assets with richer details but
also excels in editing tasks, thereby bridging the gap between 3D generation
and editing. The code is available on: https://github.com/xingy038/UDS.

Conclusion: GauS-SLAM通过优化几何一致性和深度渲染，实现了高性能的SLAM系统。

Abstract: We propose GauS-SLAM, a dense RGB-D SLAM system that leverages 2D Gaussian
surfels to achieve robust tracking and high-fidelity mapping. Our
investigations reveal that Gaussian-based scene representations exhibit
geometry distortion under novel viewpoints, which significantly degrades the
accuracy of Gaussian-based tracking methods. These geometry inconsistencies
arise primarily from the depth modeling of Gaussian primitives and the mutual
interference between surfaces during the depth blending. To address these, we
propose a 2D Gaussian-based incremental reconstruction strategy coupled with a
Surface-aware Depth Rendering mechanism, which significantly enhances geometry
accuracy and multi-view consistency. Additionally, the proposed local map
design dynamically isolates visible surfaces during tracking, mitigating
misalignment caused by occluded regions in global maps while maintaining
computational efficiency with increasing Gaussian density. Extensive
experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that GauS-SLAM outperforms
comparable methods, delivering superior tracking precision and rendering
fidelity. The project page will be made available at

Result: 实验表明，HybridGS在重建性能上与现有方法相当，同时编码和解码速度显著提升。

Conclusion: HybridGS提供了一种高效且标准化的3DGS压缩方案，适合广泛部署。

Abstract: Most existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) compression schemes focus on
producing compact 3DGS representation via implicit data embedding. They have
long coding times and highly customized data format, making it difficult for
widespread deployment. This paper presents a new 3DGS compression framework
called HybridGS, which takes advantage of both compact generation and
standardized point cloud data encoding. HybridGS first generates compact and
explicit 3DGS data. A dual-channel sparse representation is introduced to
supervise the primitive position and feature bit depth. It then utilizes a
canonical point cloud encoder to perform further data compression and form
standard output bitstreams. A simple and effective rate control scheme is
proposed to pivot the interpretable data compression scheme. At the current
stage, HybridGS does not include any modules aimed at improving 3DGS quality
during generation. But experiment results show that it still provides
comparable reconstruction performance against state-of-the-art methods, with
evidently higher encoding and decoding speed. The code is publicly available at

Method: 通过添加LoRA层微调SAM，引入语言信息指导训练，并使用跨模态知识蒸馏（CMKD）模块减少模态差异。

Result: 在多个RGB-T语义分割基准测试中，SARTM显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SARTM成功扩展了SAM的适用性，为RGB-T语义分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates strong instance
segmentation performance across various downstream tasks. However, SAM is
trained solely on RGB data, limiting its direct applicability to RGB-thermal
(RGB-T) semantic segmentation. Given that RGB-T provides a robust solution for
scene understanding in adverse weather and lighting conditions, such as low
light and overexposure, we propose a novel framework, SARTM, which customizes
the powerful SAM for RGB-T semantic segmentation. Our key idea is to unleash
the potential of SAM while introduce semantic understanding modules for RGB-T
data pairs. Specifically, our framework first involves fine tuning the original
SAM by adding extra LoRA layers, aiming at preserving SAM's strong
generalization and segmentation capabilities for downstream tasks. Secondly, we
introduce language information as guidance for training our SARTM. To address
cross-modal inconsistencies, we introduce a Cross-Modal Knowledge
Distillation(CMKD) module that effectively achieves modality adaptation while
maintaining its generalization capabilities. This semantic module enables the
minimization of modality gaps and alleviates semantic ambiguity, facilitating
the combination of any modality under any visual conditions. Furthermore, we
enhance the segmentation performance by adjusting the segmentation head of SAM
and incorporating an auxiliary semantic segmentation head, which integrates
multi-scale features for effective fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted
across three multi-modal RGBT semantic segmentation benchmarks: MFNET, PST900,
and FMB. Both quantitative and qualitative results consistently demonstrate
that the proposed SARTM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across a variety of conditions.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in
multimodal tasks, but visual object hallucination remains a persistent issue.
It refers to scenarios where models generate inaccurate visual object-related
information based on the query input, potentially leading to misinformation and
concerns about safety and reliability. Previous works focus on the evaluation
and mitigation of visual hallucinations, but the underlying causes have not
been comprehensively investigated. In this paper, we analyze each component of
LLaVA-like LVLMs -- the large language model, the vision backbone, and the
projector -- to identify potential sources of error and their impact. Based on
our observations, we propose methods to mitigate hallucination for each
problematic component. Additionally, we developed two hallucination benchmarks:
QA-VisualGenome, which emphasizes attribute and relation hallucinations, and
QA-FB15k, which focuses on cognition-based hallucinations.

Conclusion: MC3D-AD在多类别3D异常检测中表现出显著优势，具有高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) is a promising means of controlling the quality of
manufactured products. However, existing methods typically require carefully
training a task-specific model for each category independently, leading to high
cost, low efficiency, and weak generalization. Therefore, this paper presents a
novel unified model for Multi-Category 3D Anomaly Detection (MC3D-AD) that aims
to utilize both local and global geometry-aware information to reconstruct
normal representations of all categories. First, to learn robust and
generalized features of different categories, we propose an adaptive
geometry-aware masked attention module that extracts geometry variation
information to guide mask attention. Then, we introduce a local geometry-aware
encoder reinforced by the improved mask attention to encode group-level feature
tokens. Finally, we design a global query decoder that utilizes point cloud
position embeddings to improve the decoding process and reconstruction ability.
This leads to local and global geometry-aware reconstructed feature tokens for
the AD task. MC3D-AD is evaluated on two publicly available Real3D-AD and
Anomaly-ShapeNet datasets, and exhibits significant superiority over current
state-of-the-art single-category methods, achieving 3.1\% and 9.3\% improvement
in object-level AUROC over Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet, respectively. The
source code will be released upon acceptance.

injuries and fatalities worldwide, even with advancements in driver monitoring
technologies. Recent developments in machine learning (ML) and deep learning
(DL) have primarily focused on visual data to detect distraction, often
neglecting the complex, multimodal nature of driver behavior. This systematic
review assesses 74 peer-reviewed studies from 2019 to 2024 that utilize ML/DL
techniques for distracted driving detection across visual, sensor-based,
multimodal, and emerging modalities. The review highlights a significant
prevalence of visual-only models, particularly convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and temporal architectures, which achieve high accuracy but show limited
generalizability in real-world scenarios. Sensor-based and physiological models
provide complementary strengths by capturing internal states and vehicle
dynamics, while emerging techniques, such as auditory sensing and radio
frequency (RF) methods, offer privacy-aware alternatives. Multimodal
architecture consistently surpasses unimodal baselines, demonstrating enhanced
robustness, context awareness, and scalability by integrating diverse data
streams. These findings emphasize the need to move beyond visual-only
approaches and adopt multimodal systems that combine visual, physiological, and
vehicular cues while keeping in checking the need to balance computational
requirements. Future research should focus on developing lightweight,
deployable multimodal frameworks, incorporating personalized baselines, and
establishing cross-modality benchmarks to ensure real-world reliability in
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and road safety interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSI在癌症诊断中至关重要，但其大尺寸和分布式存储带来存储、处理和模型训练挑战，需开发终身学习方法以支持多机构协作。

Method: 提出ADaFGrad方法，结合病理视觉语言模型与文本原型缓冲区交互，并设计梯度蒸馏机制以在持续学习中保留知识。

Result: ADaFGrad在TCGA数据集上表现优异，分类准确率最高提升40.084%，且在类增量学习场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ADaFGrad为WSI分析提供了一种高效的终身学习解决方案，适用于临床和医院环境。

Abstract: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) play a crucial role in accurate cancer diagnosis
and prognosis, as they provide tissue details at the cellular level. However,
the rapid growth of computational tasks involving WSIs poses significant
challenges. Given that WSIs are gigapixels in size, they present difficulties
in terms of storage, processing, and model training. Therefore, it is essential
to develop lifelong learning approaches for WSI analysis. In scenarios where
slides are distributed across multiple institutes, we aim to leverage them to
develop a unified online model as a computational tool for cancer diagnosis in
clinical and hospital settings. In this study, we introduce ADaFGrad, a method
designed to enhance lifelong learning for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis.
First, we leverage pathology vision-language foundation models to develop a
framework that enables interaction between a slide's regional tissue features
and a predefined text-based prototype buffer. Additionally, we propose a
gradient-distillation mechanism that mimics the gradient of a logit with
respect to the classification-head parameters across past and current
iterations in a continual-learning setting. We construct a sequence of six TCGA
datasets for training and evaluation. Experimental results show that ADaFGrad
outperforms both state-of-the-art WSI-specific and conventional
continual-learning methods after only a few training epochs, exceeding them by
up to +5.068% in the class-incremental learning scenario while exhibiting the
least forgetting (i.e., retaining the most knowledge from previous tasks).
Moreover, ADaFGrad surpasses its baseline by as much as +40.084% in accuracy,
further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modules.

Result: 模型分类准确率达99.14%，且运行速度快。

Conclusion: 该方法为药物检测提供了一种高效、可靠的解决方案，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: The proliferation of new types of drugs necessitates the urgent development
of faster and more accurate detection methods. Traditional detection methods
have high requirements for instruments and environments, making the operation
complex. X-ray absorption spectroscopy, a non-destructive detection technique,
offers advantages such as ease of operation, penetrative observation, and
strong substance differentiation capabilities, making it well-suited for
application in the field of drug detection and identification. In this study,
we constructed a classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to
classify and identify drugs based on their X-ray spectral profiles. In the
experiments, we selected 14 chemical reagents with chemical formulas similar to
drugs as samples. We utilized CNN to extract features from the spectral data of
these 14 chemical reagents and used the extracted features to train an SVM
model. We also utilized PSO to optimize two critical initial parameters of the
SVM. The experimental results demonstrate that this model achieved higher
classification accuracy compared to two other common methods, with a prediction
accuracy of 99.14%. Additionally, the model exhibited fast execution speed,
mitigating the drawback of a drastic increase in running time and efficiency
reduction that may result from the direct fusion of PSO and SVM. Therefore, the
combined approach of X-ray absorption spectroscopy with CNN, PSO, and SVM
provides a rapid, highly accurate, and reliable classification and
identification method for the field of drug detection, holding promising
prospects for widespread application.

Conclusion: Switch-NeRF++是一个高效且可扩展的大规模场景NeRF解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Recent NeRF methods on large-scale scenes have underlined the importance of
scene decomposition for scalable NeRFs. Although achieving reasonable
scalability, there are several critical problems remaining unexplored, i.e.,
learnable decomposition, modeling scene heterogeneity, and modeling efficiency.
In this paper, we introduce Switch-NeRF++, a Heterogeneous Mixture of Hash
Experts (HMoHE) network that addresses these challenges within a unified
framework. It is a highly scalable NeRF that learns heterogeneous decomposition
and heterogeneous NeRFs efficiently for large-scale scenes in an end-to-end
manner. In our framework, a gating network learns to decomposes scenes and
allocates 3D points to specialized NeRF experts. This gating network is
co-optimized with the experts, by our proposed Sparsely Gated Mixture of
Experts (MoE) NeRF framework. We incorporate a hash-based gating network and
distinct heterogeneous hash experts. The hash-based gating efficiently learns
the decomposition of the large-scale scene. The distinct heterogeneous hash
experts consist of hash grids of different resolution ranges, enabling
effective learning of the heterogeneous representation of different scene
parts. These design choices make our framework an end-to-end and highly
scalable NeRF solution for real-world large-scale scene modeling to achieve
both quality and efficiency. We evaluate our accuracy and scalability on
existing large-scale NeRF datasets and a new dataset with very large-scale
scenes ($>6.5km^2$) from UrbanBIS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach can be easily scaled to various large-scale scenes and achieve
state-of-the-art scene rendering accuracy. Furthermore, our method exhibits
significant efficiency, with an 8x acceleration in training and a 16x
acceleration in rendering compared to Switch-NeRF. Codes will be released in

Abstract: Accelerated MRI reconstruction involves solving an ill-posed inverse problem
where noise in acquired data propagates to the reconstructed images. Noise
analyses are central to MRI reconstruction for providing an explicit measure of
solution fidelity and for guiding the design and deployment of novel
reconstruction methods. However, deep learning (DL)-based reconstruction
methods have often overlooked noise propagation due to inherent analytical and
computational challenges, despite its critical importance. This work proposes a
theoretically grounded, memory-efficient technique to calculate voxel-wise
variance for quantifying uncertainty due to acquisition noise in accelerated
MRI reconstructions. Our approach approximates noise covariance using the DL
network's Jacobian, which is intractable to calculate. To circumvent this, we
derive an unbiased estimator for the diagonal of this covariance matrix
(voxel-wise variance) and introduce a Jacobian sketching technique to
efficiently implement it. We evaluate our method on knee and brain MRI datasets
for both data- and physics-driven networks trained in supervised and
unsupervised manners. Compared to empirical references obtained via Monte Carlo
simulations, our technique achieves near-equivalent performance while reducing
computational and memory demands by an order of magnitude or more. Furthermore,
our method is robust across varying input noise levels, acceleration factors,
and diverse undersampling schemes, highlighting its broad applicability. Our
work reintroduces accurate and efficient noise analysis as a central tenet of
reconstruction algorithms, holding promise to reshape how we evaluate and
deploy DL-based MRI. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有方法在视觉和文本模态的融合上表现不佳，亟需一种更有效的人脸伪造检测方案。

Method: 提出EFF++数据集（带文本注释的伪造帧）和VLF-Net网络（双向视觉-语言特征交互），采用三阶段训练流程。

Result: VLF-FFD在跨数据集和数据集内评估中均达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: VLF-FFD通过视觉-语言融合显著提升了人脸伪造检测效果。

Abstract: Reliable face forgery detection algorithms are crucial for countering the
growing threat of deepfake-driven disinformation. Previous research has
demonstrated the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in
identifying manipulated faces. However, existing methods typically depend on
either the Large Language Model (LLM) alone or an external detector to generate
classification results, which often leads to sub-optimal integration of visual
and textual modalities. In this paper, we propose VLF-FFD, a novel
Vision-Language Fusion solution for MLLM-enhanced Face Forgery Detection. Our
key contributions are twofold. First, we present EFF++, a frame-level,
explainability-driven extension of the widely used FaceForensics++ (FF++)
dataset. In EFF++, each manipulated video frame is paired with a textual
annotation that describes both the forgery artifacts and the specific
manipulation technique applied, enabling more effective and informative MLLM
training. Second, we design a Vision-Language Fusion Network (VLF-Net) that
promotes bidirectional interaction between visual and textual features,
supported by a three-stage training pipeline to fully leverage its potential.
VLF-FFD achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both cross-dataset and
intra-dataset evaluations, underscoring its exceptional effectiveness in face
forgery detection.

Abstract: Reasoning stands as a cornerstone of intelligence, enabling the synthesis of
existing knowledge to solve complex problems. Despite remarkable progress,
existing reasoning benchmarks often fail to rigorously evaluate the nuanced
reasoning capabilities required for complex, real-world problemsolving,
particularly in multi-disciplinary and multimodal contexts. In this paper, we
introduce a graduate-level, multi-disciplinary, EnglishChinese benchmark,
dubbed as Reasoning Bench (R-Bench), for assessing the reasoning capability of
both language and multimodal models. RBench spans 1,094 questions across 108
subjects for language model evaluation and 665 questions across 83 subjects for
multimodal model testing in both English and Chinese. These questions are
meticulously curated to ensure rigorous difficulty calibration, subject
balance, and crosslinguistic alignment, enabling the assessment to be an
Olympiad-level multi-disciplinary benchmark. We evaluate widely used models,
including OpenAI o1, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, etc. Experimental results indicate
that advanced models perform poorly on complex reasoning, especially multimodal
reasoning. Even the top-performing model OpenAI o1 achieves only 53.2% accuracy
on our multimodal evaluation. Data and code are made publicly available at

Abstract: Relative pose estimation, a fundamental computer vision problem, has been
extensively studied for decades. Existing methods either estimate and decompose
the essential matrix or directly estimate the rotation and translation to
obtain the solution. In this article, we break the mold by tackling this
traditional problem with a novel birotation solution. We first introduce three
basis transformations, each associated with a geometric metric to quantify the
distance between the relative pose to be estimated and its corresponding basis
transformation. Three energy functions, designed based on these metrics, are
then minimized on the Riemannian manifold $\mathrm{SO(3)}$ by iteratively
updating the two rotation matrices. The two rotation matrices and the basis
transformation corresponding to the minimum energy are ultimately utilized to
recover the relative pose. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across diverse relative pose estimation tasks demonstrate the superior
performance of our proposed birotation solution. Source code, demo video, and
datasets will be available at

Conclusion: Point2Primitive方法能够高效地从点云生成高质量的CAD模型，为CAD重建任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recovering CAD models from point clouds, especially the sketch-extrusion
process, can be seen as the process of rebuilding the topology and extrusion
primitives. Previous methods utilize implicit fields for sketch representation,
leading to shape reconstruction of curved edges. In this paper, we proposed a
CAD reconstruction network that produces editable CAD models from input point
clouds (Point2Primitive) by directly predicting every element of the extrusion
primitives. Point2Primitive can directly detect and predict sketch curves (type
and parameter) from point clouds based on an improved transformer. The sketch
curve parameters are formulated as position queries and optimized in an
autoregressive way, leading to high parameter accuracy. The topology is rebuilt
by extrusion segmentation, and each extrusion parameter (sketch and extrusion
operation) is recovered by combining the predicted curves and the computed
extrusion operation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is
superior in primitive prediction accuracy and CAD reconstruction. The
reconstructed shapes are of high geometrical fidelity.

Abstract: Accurate mineral identification on the Martian surface is critical for
understanding the planet's geological history. This paper presents a UNet-based
autoencoder model for efficient spectral preprocessing of CRISM MTRDR
hyperspectral data, addressing the limitations of traditional methods that are
computationally intensive and time-consuming. The proposed model automates key
preprocessing steps, such as smoothing and continuum removal, while preserving
essential mineral absorption features. Trained on augmented spectra from the
MICA spectral library, the model introduces realistic variability to simulate
MTRDR data conditions. By integrating this framework, preprocessing time for an
800x800 MTRDR scene is reduced from 1.5 hours to just 5 minutes on an NVIDIA
T1600 GPU. The preprocessed spectra are subsequently classified using MICAnet,
a deep learning model for Martian mineral identification. Evaluation on labeled
CRISM TRDR data demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves competitive
accuracy while significantly enhancing preprocessing efficiency. This work
highlights the potential of the UNet-based preprocessing framework to improve
the speed and reliability of mineral mapping on Mars.

Abstract: Adapting vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks with pseudolabels
has gained increasing attention. A major obstacle is that the pseudolabels
generated by VLMs tend to be imbalanced, leading to inferior performance. While
existing methods have explored various strategies to address this, the
underlying causes of imbalance remain insufficiently investigated. To fill this
gap, we delve into imbalanced pseudolabels and identify two primary
contributing factors: concept mismatch and concept confusion. To mitigate these
two issues, we propose a novel framework incorporating concept alignment and
confusion-aware calibrated margin mechanisms. The core of our approach lies in
enhancing underperforming classes and promoting balanced predictions across
categories, thus mitigating imbalance. Extensive experiments on six benchmark
datasets with three learning paradigms demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively enhances the accuracy and balance of pseudolabels, achieving a
relative improvement of 6.29% over the SoTA method. Our code is avaliable at

Abstract: Face detection and face recognition have been in the focus of vision
community since the very beginnings. Inspired by the success of the original
Videoface digitizer, a pioneering device that allowed users to capture video
signals from any source, we have designed an advanced video analytics tool to
efficiently create structured video stories, i.e. identity-based information
catalogs. VideoFace2.0 is the name of the developed system for spatial and
temporal localization of each unique face in the input video, i.e. face
re-identification (ReID), which also allows their cataloging, characterization
and creation of structured video outputs for later downstream tasks. Developed
near real-time solution is primarily designed to be utilized in application
scenarios involving TV production, media analysis, and as an efficient tool for
creating large video datasets necessary for training machine learning (ML)
models in challenging vision tasks such as lip reading and multimodal speech
recognition. Conducted experiments confirm applicability of the proposed face
ReID algorithm that is combining the concepts of face detection, face
recognition and passive tracking-by-detection in order to achieve robust and
efficient face ReID. The system is envisioned as a compact and modular
extensions of the existing video production equipment. We hope that the
presented work and shared code will stimulate further interest in development
of similar, application specific video analysis tools, and lower the entry
barrier for production of high-quality multi-modal ML datasets in the future.

Method: RTV-Bench基于三个原则：多时间戳问答（MTQA）、分层问题结构和多维度评估。

Result: 开源实时模型表现优于离线模型，但不及专有模型；模型大小或帧采样率对性能提升有限。

Conclusion: 需要优化模型架构以提升实时视频分析能力，RTV-Bench为相关研究提供了工具支持。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly excel at perception,
understanding, and reasoning. However, current benchmarks inadequately evaluate
their ability to perform these tasks continuously in dynamic, real-world
environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce RTV-Bench, a fine-grained
benchmark for MLLM real-time video analysis. RTV-Bench uses three key
principles: (1) Multi-Timestamp Question Answering (MTQA), where answers evolve
with scene changes; (2) Hierarchical Question Structure, combining basic and
advanced queries; and (3) Multi-dimensional Evaluation, assessing the ability
of continuous perception, understanding, and reasoning. RTV-Bench contains 552
diverse videos (167.2 hours) and 4,631 high-quality QA pairs. We evaluated
leading MLLMs, including proprietary (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0), open-source offline
(Qwen2.5-VL, VideoLLaMA3), and open-source real-time (VITA-1.5,
InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive) models. Experiment results show open-source
real-time models largely outperform offline ones but still trail top
proprietary models. Our analysis also reveals that larger model size or higher
frame sampling rates do not significantly boost RTV-Bench performance,
sometimes causing slight decreases. This underscores the need for better model
architectures optimized for video stream processing and long sequences to
advance real-time video analysis with MLLMs. Our benchmark toolkit is available

Abstract: We propose the Compact Clustering Attention (COCA) layer, an effective
building block that introduces a hierarchical strategy for object-centric
representation learning, while solving the unsupervised object discovery task
on single images. COCA is an attention-based clustering module capable of
extracting object-centric representations from multi-object scenes, when
cascaded into a bottom-up hierarchical network architecture, referred to as
COCA-Net. At its core, COCA utilizes a novel clustering algorithm that
leverages the physical concept of compactness, to highlight distinct object
centroids in a scene, providing a spatial inductive bias. Thanks to this
strategy, COCA-Net generates high-quality segmentation masks on both the
decoder side and, notably, the encoder side of its pipeline. Additionally,
COCA-Net is not bound by a predetermined number of object masks that it
generates and handles the segmentation of background elements better than its
competitors. We demonstrate COCA-Net's segmentation performance on six widely
adopted datasets, achieving superior or competitive results against the
state-of-the-art models across nine different evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) are large-scale, pre-trained models that
serve as general-purpose backbones for various computer vision tasks. As VFMs'
popularity grows, there is an increasing interest in understanding their
effectiveness for dense prediction tasks. However, VFMs typically produce
low-resolution features, limiting their direct applicability in this context.
One way to tackle this limitation is by employing a task-agnostic feature
upsampling module that refines VFM features resolution. To assess the
effectiveness of this approach, we investigate Interactive Segmentation (IS) as
a novel benchmark for evaluating feature upsampling methods on VFMs. Due to its
inherent multimodal input, consisting of an image and a set of user-defined
clicks, as well as its dense mask output, IS creates a challenging environment
that demands comprehensive visual scene understanding. Our benchmarking
experiments show that selecting appropriate upsampling strategies significantly
improves VFM features quality. The code is released at

TLDR: HandOcc是一种基于占位的新型手部渲染框架，通过结合NeRF和占位表示，摆脱了对参数化网格的依赖，实现了高保真和快速渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖参数化网格，限制了模型的通用性和渲染质量。HandOcc旨在解决这一问题，提供更灵活、高质量的渲染方案。

Method: 利用基于占位的NeRF渲染器，仅需3D骨架输入，通过卷积模型提取外观，并利用占位表示优化手部交互效果。

Result: 在InterHand2.6M数据集上取得了最先进的结果，实现了快速渲染和高质量外观迁移。

Conclusion: HandOcc通过占位表示和NeRF的结合，显著提升了手部渲染的灵活性和质量，为无网格渲染提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose HandOcc, a novel framework for hand rendering based upon
occupancy. Popular rendering methods such as NeRF are often combined with
parametric meshes to provide deformable hand models. However, in doing so, such
approaches present a trade-off between the fidelity of the mesh and the
complexity and dimensionality of the parametric model. The simplicity of
parametric mesh structures is appealing, but the underlying issue is that it
binds methods to mesh initialization, making it unable to generalize to objects
where a parametric model does not exist. It also means that estimation is tied
to mesh resolution and the accuracy of mesh fitting. This paper presents a
pipeline for meshless 3D rendering, which we apply to the hands. By providing
only a 3D skeleton, the desired appearance is extracted via a convolutional
model. We do this by exploiting a NeRF renderer conditioned upon an
occupancy-based representation. The approach uses the hand occupancy to resolve
hand-to-hand interactions further improving results, allowing fast rendering,
and excellent hand appearance transfer. On the benchmark InterHand2.6M dataset,
we achieved state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 该方法能够从少量视角数据中准确建模复杂人体动作，为手语等精细动作渲染提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for conditional human body rendering via Gaussian
splatting typically focus on simple body motions captured from many views. This
is often in the context of dancing or walking. However, for more complex use
cases, such as sign language, we care less about large body motion and more
about subtle and complex motions of the hands and face. The problems of
building high fidelity models are compounded by the complexity of capturing
multi-view data of sign. The solution is to make better use of sequence data,
ensuring that we can overcome the limited information from only a few views by
exploiting temporal variability. Nevertheless, learning from sequence-level
data requires extremely accurate and consistent model fitting to ensure that
appearance is consistent across complex motions. We focus on how to achieve
this, constraining mesh parameters to build an accurate Gaussian splatting
framework from few views capable of modelling subtle human motion. We leverage
regularization techniques on the Gaussian parameters to mitigate overfitting
and rendering artifacts. Additionally, we propose a new adaptive control method
to densify Gaussians and prune splat points on the mesh surface. To demonstrate
the accuracy of our approach, we render novel sequences of sign language video,
building on neural machine translation approaches to sign stitching. On
benchmark datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance; and on
highly articulated and complex sign language motion, we significantly
outperform competing approaches.

Conclusion: SSC-HSR框架通过改进对齐和模块交互，显著提升了高光谱超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images super-resolution aims to improve the spatial resolution,
yet its performance is often limited at high-resolution ratios. The recent
adoption of high-resolution reference images for super-resolution is driven by
the poor spatial detail found in low-resolution HSIs, presenting it as a
favorable method. However, these approaches cannot effectively utilize
information from the reference image, due to the inaccuracy of alignment and
its inadequate interaction between alignment and fusion modules. In this paper,
we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Concordance Hyperspectral Super-Resolution
(SSC-HSR) framework for unaligned reference RGB guided HSI SR to address the
issues of inaccurate alignment and poor interactivity of the previous
approaches. Specifically, to ensure spatial concordance, i.e., align images
more accurately across resolutions and refine textures, we construct a
Two-Stage Image Alignment with a synthetic generation pipeline in the image
alignment module, where the fine-tuned optical flow model can produce a more
accurate optical flow in the first stage and warp model can refine damaged
textures in the second stage. To enhance the interaction between alignment and
fusion modules and ensure spectral concordance during reconstruction, we
propose a Feature Aggregation module and an Attention Fusion module. In the
feature aggregation module, we introduce an Iterative Deformable Feature
Aggregation block to achieve significant feature matching and texture
aggregation with the fusion multi-scale results guidance, iteratively
generating learnable offset. Besides, we introduce two basic spectral-wise
attention blocks in the attention fusion module to model the inter-spectra
interactions. Extensive experiments on three natural or remote-sensing datasets
show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: GarmentGS为3D服装重建提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional 3D garment creation requires extensive manual operations,
resulting in time and labor costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved
breakthrough progress in 3D scene reconstruction and rendering, attracting
widespread attention and opening new pathways for 3D garment reconstruction.
However, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian primitives,
it is difficult to reconstruct high-fidelity, non-watertight 3D garments. In
this paper, we present GarmentGS, a dense point cloud-guided method that can
reconstruct high-fidelity garment surfaces with high geometric accuracy and
generate non-watertight, single-layer meshes. Our method introduces a fast
dense point cloud reconstruction module that can complete garment point cloud
reconstruction in 10 minutes, compared to traditional methods that require
several hours. Furthermore, we use dense point clouds to guide the movement,
flattening, and rotation of Gaussian primitives, enabling better distribution
on the garment surface to achieve superior rendering effects and geometric
accuracy. Through numerical and visual comparisons, our method achieves fast
training and real-time rendering while maintaining competitive quality.

Abstract: Developing effective approaches to generate enhanced results that align well
with human visual preferences for high-quality well-lit images remains a
challenge in low-light image enhancement (LLIE). In this paper, we propose a
human-in-the-loop LLIE training framework that improves the visual quality of
unsupervised LLIE model outputs through iterative training stages, named
HiLLIE. At each stage, we introduce human guidance into the training process
through efficient visual quality annotations of enhanced outputs. Subsequently,
we employ a tailored image quality assessment (IQA) model to learn human visual
preferences encoded in the acquired labels, which is then utilized to guide the
training process of an enhancement model. With only a small amount of pairwise
ranking annotations required at each stage, our approach continually improves
the IQA model's capability to simulate human visual assessment of enhanced
outputs, thus leading to visually appealing LLIE results. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves unsupervised LLIE model
performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative performance. The code

Abstract: To operate safely, autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to detect and handle
unexpected objects or anomalies on the road. While significant research exists
for anomaly detection and segmentation in 2D, research progress in 3D is
underexplored. Existing datasets lack high-quality multimodal data that are
typically found in AVs. This paper presents a novel dataset for anomaly
segmentation in driving scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
first publicly available dataset focused on road anomaly segmentation with
dense 3D semantic labeling, incorporating both LiDAR and camera data, as well
as sequential information to enable anomaly detection across various ranges.
This capability is critical for the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles. We
adapted and evaluated several baseline models for 3D segmentation, highlighting
the challenges of 3D anomaly detection in driving environments. Our dataset and
evaluation code will be openly available, facilitating the testing and
performance comparison of different approaches.

Result: 在长视频测试集上，LRTI-VSR实现了最先进的性能，同时保持训练和计算效率。

Conclusion: LRTI-VSR通过高效利用长距离时间信息，显著提升了视频超分辨率的效果。

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) can achieve better performance compared to
single image super-resolution by additionally leveraging temporal information.
In particular, the recurrent-based VSR model exploits long-range temporal
information during inference and achieves superior detail restoration. However,
effectively learning these long-term dependencies within long videos remains a
key challenge. To address this, we propose LRTI-VSR, a novel training framework
for recurrent VSR that efficiently leverages Long-Range Refocused Temporal
Information. Our framework includes a generic training strategy that utilizes
temporal propagation features from long video clips while training on shorter
video clips. Additionally, we introduce a refocused intra&inter-frame
transformer block which allows the VSR model to selectively prioritize useful
temporal information through its attention module while further improving
inter-frame information utilization in the FFN module. We evaluate LRTI-VSR on
both CNN and transformer-based VSR architectures, conducting extensive ablation
studies to validate the contribution of each component. Experiments on
long-video test sets demonstrate that LRTI-VSR achieves state-of-the-art
performance while maintaining training and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力机制对所有像素或关键点平等处理，可能引入冗余和噪声，因此需要一种更智能的注意力调整方法。

Method: 提出双重设计：1）在softmax前注入可学习的偏置项调整注意力分数；2）在注意力后根据匹配性重新缩放特征值。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过动态调整注意力权重和特征表示，有效提升了匹配性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Since the rise of Transformers, many semi-dense matching methods have adopted
attention mechanisms to extract feature descriptors. However, the attention
weights, which capture dependencies between pixels or keypoints, are often
learned from scratch. This approach can introduce redundancy and noisy
interactions from irrelevant regions, as it treats all pixels or keypoints
equally. Drawing inspiration from keypoint selection processes, we propose to
first classify all pixels into two categories: matchable and non-matchable.
Matchable pixels are expected to receive higher attention weights, while
non-matchable ones are down-weighted. In this work, we propose a novel
attention reweighting mechanism that simultaneously incorporates a learnable
bias term into the attention logits and applies a matchability-informed
rescaling to the input value features. The bias term, injected prior to the
softmax operation, selectively adjusts attention scores based on the confidence
of query-key interactions. Concurrently, the feature rescaling acts
post-attention by modulating the influence of each value vector in the final
output. This dual design allows the attention mechanism to dynamically adjust
both its internal weighting scheme and the magnitude of its output
representations. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets
validate the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏视图下实现了高性能的3D重建和NVS，同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Recovering 3D information from scenes via multi-view stereo reconstruction
(MVS) and novel view synthesis (NVS) is inherently challenging, particularly in
scenarios involving sparse-view setups. The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) enabled real-time, photorealistic NVS. Following this, 2D Gaussian
Splatting (2DGS) leveraged perspective accurate 2D Gaussian primitive
rasterization to achieve accurate geometry representation during rendering,
improving 3D scene reconstruction while maintaining real-time performance.
Recent approaches have tackled the problem of sparse real-time NVS using 3DGS
within a generalizable, MVS-based learning framework to regress 3D Gaussian
parameters. Our work extends this line of research by addressing the challenge
of generalizable sparse 3D reconstruction and NVS jointly, and manages to
perform successfully at both tasks. We propose an MVS-based learning pipeline
that regresses 2DGS surface element parameters in a feed-forward fashion to
perform 3D shape reconstruction and NVS from sparse-view images. We further
show that our generalizable pipeline can benefit from preexisting foundational
multi-view deep visual features. The resulting model attains the
state-of-the-art results on the DTU sparse 3D reconstruction benchmark in terms
of Chamfer distance to ground-truth, as-well as state-of-the-art NVS. It also
demonstrates strong generalization on the BlendedMVS and Tanks and Temples
datasets. We note that our model outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in
feed-forward sparse view reconstruction based on volume rendering of implicit
representations, while offering an almost 2 orders of magnitude higher
inference speed.

Abstract: Saliency-guided training, which directs model learning to important regions

create a dataset of 800 human-annotated fingerprint perceptually-important
maps, explored alongside algorithmically-generated "pseudosaliency," including
minutiae-based, image quality-based, and autoencoder-based saliency maps.
Evaluating on the 2021 Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition testing set,
we explore various configurations within five distinct training scenarios to
assess the impact of saliency-guided training on accuracy and generalization.
Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of saliency-guided training for
fingerprint PAD in both limited and large data contexts, and we present a
configuration capable of earning the first place on the LivDet-2021 benchmark.
Our results highlight saliency-guided training's promise for increased model

Conclusion: 智能数据收集策略可显著减少CLIP模型训练所需数据量和时间。

Abstract: Training high-quality CLIP models typically requires enormous datasets, which
limits the development of domain-specific models -- especially in areas that
even the largest CLIP models do not cover well -- and drives up training costs.
This poses challenges for scientific research that needs fine-grained control
over the training procedure of CLIP models. In this work, we show that by
employing smart web search strategies enhanced with knowledge graphs, a robust
CLIP model can be trained from scratch with considerably less data.
Specifically, we demonstrate that an expert foundation model for living
organisms can be built using just 10M images. Moreover, we introduce EntityNet,
a dataset comprising 33M images paired with 46M text descriptions, which
enables the training of a generic CLIP model in significantly reduced time.

Abstract: We present a method for Sparse view reconstruction with surface element
splatting that runs within 3 minutes on a consumer grade GPU. While few methods
address sparse radiance field learning from noisy or unposed sparse cameras,
shape recovery remains relatively underexplored in this setting. Several
radiance and shape learning test-time optimization methods address the sparse
posed setting by learning data priors or using combinations of external
monocular geometry priors. Differently, we propose an efficient and simple
pipeline harnessing a single recent 3D foundation model. We leverage its
various task heads, notably point maps and camera initializations to
instantiate a bundle adjusting 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) model, and image
correspondences to guide camera optimization midst 2DGS training. Key to our
contribution is a novel formulation of splatted color variance along rays,
which can be computed efficiently. Reducing this moment in training leads to
more accurate shape reconstructions. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
performances in the sparse uncalibrated setting in reconstruction and novel
view benchmarks based on established multi-view datasets.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) using Multiple Instance

learning. We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two
synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides
controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes,
establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal
data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts
separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most
reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD
achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M

Abstract: Deepfakes, created using advanced AI techniques such as Variational
Autoencoder and Generative Adversarial Networks, have evolved from research and
entertainment applications into tools for malicious activities, posing
significant threats to digital trust. Current deepfake detection techniques
have evolved from CNN-based methods focused on local artifacts to more advanced
approaches using vision transformers and multimodal models like CLIP, which
capture global anomalies and improve cross-domain generalization. Despite
recent progress, state-of-the-art deepfake detectors still face major
challenges in handling distribution shifts from emerging generative models and
addressing severe class imbalance between authentic and fake samples in
deepfake datasets, which limits their robustness and detection accuracy. To
address these challenges, we propose a framework that combines dynamic loss
reweighting and ranking-based optimization, which achieves superior
generalization and performance under imbalanced dataset conditions. The code is

Conclusion: AOR框架显著提升了MLMMs的交互性和可解释性。

Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most frequently performed imaging examinations in
clinical settings. Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have
enabled automated CXR interpretation, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and
efficiency. However, despite their strong visual understanding, current Medical
LMMs (MLMMs) still face two major challenges: (1) Insufficient region-level
understanding and interaction, and (2) Limited accuracy and interpretability
due to single-step reasoning. In this paper, we empower MLMMs with
anatomy-centric reasoning capabilities to enhance their interactivity and
explainability. Specifically, we first propose an Anatomical Ontology-Guided
Reasoning (AOR) framework, which centers on cross-modal region-level
information to facilitate multi-step reasoning. Next, under the guidance of
expert physicians, we develop AOR-Instruction, a large instruction dataset for
MLMMs training. Our experiments demonstrate AOR's superior performance in both
VQA and report generation tasks.

*Wenchuan Wang,Mengqi Huang,Yijing Tu,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: DualReal框架通过联合训练解决文本到视频生成中身份与运动的冲突，显著提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法单独定制身份或运动，忽略二者协同关系，导致生成过程中冲突频发。

Method: DualReal采用双单元设计：Dual-aware Adaptation动态选择训练阶段并避免知识泄漏；StageBlender Controller通过去噪阶段和Transformer深度指导不同维度。

Result: 实验表明，DualReal在CLIP-I和DINO-I指标上分别提升21.7%和31.8%，运动质量指标表现最佳。

Conclusion: DualReal通过协同训练实现身份与运动无损融合，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Customized text-to-video generation with pre-trained large-scale models has
recently garnered significant attention through focusing on identity and motion
consistency. Existing works typically follow the isolated customized paradigm,
where the subject identity or motion dynamics are customized exclusively.
However, this paradigm completely ignores the intrinsic mutual constraints and
synergistic interdependencies between identity and motion, resulting in
identity-motion conflicts throughout the generation process that systematically
degrades. To address this, we introduce DualReal, a novel framework that,
employs adaptive joint training to collaboratively construct interdependencies
between dimensions. Specifically, DualReal is composed of two units: (1)
Dual-aware Adaptation dynamically selects a training phase (i.e., identity or
motion), learns the current information guided by the frozen dimension prior,
and employs a regularization strategy to avoid knowledge leakage; (2)
StageBlender Controller leverages the denoising stages and Diffusion
Transformer depths to guide different dimensions with adaptive granularity,
avoiding conflicts at various stages and ultimately achieving lossless fusion
of identity and motion patterns. We constructed a more comprehensive benchmark
than existing methods. The experimental results show that DualReal improves
CLIP-I and DINO-I metrics by 21.7% and 31.8% on average, and achieves top
performance on nearly all motion quality metrics.

TLDR: 本文探讨了如何通过强化学习（RL）改进多模态奖励模型（MRMs），提出了StableReinforce算法，解决了现有RL算法在奖励建模中的不稳定问题，并在多模态奖励基准上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态奖励模型（MRMs）对提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）性能至关重要，但目前对长期推理能力在奖励建模中的有效性及其激活方法研究不足。

Method: 将奖励建模问题重新定义为基于规则的RL任务，并提出StableReinforce算法，改进训练损失、优势估计策略和奖励设计。

Result: R1-Reward模型在VL Reward-Bench和Multimodal Reward Bench上分别提升8.4%和14.3%，且推理计算增加时性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: StableReinforce算法有效优化了MRMs，展示了RL算法在奖励建模中的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) play a crucial role in enhancing the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While recent
advancements have primarily focused on improving the model structure and
training data of MRMs, there has been limited exploration into the
effectiveness of long-term reasoning capabilities for reward modeling and how
to activate these capabilities in MRMs. In this paper, we explore how
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to improve reward modeling.
Specifically, we reformulate the reward modeling problem as a rule-based RL
task. However, we observe that directly applying existing RL algorithms, such
as Reinforce++, to reward modeling often leads to training instability or even
collapse due to the inherent limitations of these algorithms. To address this
issue, we propose the StableReinforce algorithm, which refines the training
loss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods.
These refinements result in more stable training dynamics and superior
performance. To facilitate MRM training, we collect 200K preference data from
diverse datasets. Our reward model, R1-Reward, trained using the
StableReinforce algorithm on this dataset, significantly improves performance
on multimodal reward modeling benchmarks. Compared to previous SOTA models,
R1-Reward achieves a $8.4\%$ improvement on the VL Reward-Bench and a $14.3\%$
improvement on the Multimodal Reward Bench. Moreover, with more inference
compute, R1-Reward's performance is further enhanced, highlighting the
potential of RL algorithms in optimizing MRMs.

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models struggle to accurately represent
object states (e.g., "a table without a bottle," "an empty tumbler"). In this
work, we first design a fully-automatic pipeline to generate high-quality
synthetic data that accurately captures objects in varied states. Next, we
fine-tune several open-source text-to-image models on this synthetic data. We
evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models by quantifying the alignment
of the generated images to their prompts using GPT4o-mini, and achieve an
average absolute improvement of 8+% across four models on the public
GenAI-Bench dataset. We also curate a collection of 200 prompts with a specific
focus on common objects in various physical states. We demonstrate a
significant improvement of an average of 24+% over the baseline on this
dataset. We release all evaluation prompts and code.

Motivation: 扩散模型在视觉生成任务中表现出色，但其冗长的去噪链和高计算量的噪声估计网络限制了其在低延迟和资源受限环境中的应用。

Method: 提出了一种采样感知的量化策略，结合混合阶轨迹对齐技术，严格约束每一步采样的误差范围，以实现更线性的概率流。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高质量生成的同时，显著提升了扩散模型在低延迟和资源受限环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as the dominant approach in visual
generation tasks. However, the lengthy denoising chains and the computationally
intensive noise estimation networks hinder their applicability in low-latency
and resource-limited environments. Previous research has endeavored to address
these limitations in a decoupled manner, utilizing either advanced samplers or
efficient model quantization techniques. In this study, we uncover that
quantization-induced noise disrupts directional estimation at each sampling
step, further distorting the precise directional estimations of higher-order
samplers when solving the sampling equations through discretized numerical
methods, thereby altering the optimal sampling trajectory. To attain dual
acceleration with high fidelity, we propose a sampling-aware quantization
strategy, wherein a Mixed-Order Trajectory Alignment technique is devised to
impose a more stringent constraint on the error bounds at each sampling step,
facilitating a more linear probability flow. Extensive experiments on
sparse-step fast sampling across multiple datasets demonstrate that our
approach preserves the rapid convergence characteristics of high-speed samplers
while maintaining superior generation quality. Code will be made publicly
available soon.

Conclusion: cricket传感器具有广泛的应用潜力，尤其是在无电池和无线通信领域。

Abstract: We present a sensor that can measure light and wirelessly communicate the
measurement, without the need for an external power source or a battery. Our
sensor, called cricket, harvests energy from incident light. It is asleep for
most of the time and transmits a short and strong radio frequency chirp when
its harvested energy reaches a specific level. The carrier frequency of each
cricket is fixed and reveals its identity, and the duration between consecutive
chirps is a measure of the incident light level. We have characterized the
radiometric response function, signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range of
cricket. We have experimentally verified that cricket can be miniaturized at
the expense of increasing the duration between chirps. We show that a cube with
a cricket on each of its sides can be used to estimate the centroid of any
complex illumination, which has value in applications such as solar tracking.
We also demonstrate the use of crickets for creating untethered sensor arrays
that can produce video and control lighting for energy conservation. Finally,
we modified cricket's circuit to develop battery-free electronic sunglasses
that can instantly adapt to environmental illumination.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过结合蒸馏模型和增强层，可以显著提升大规模图像生成的效率。

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to enhance the cost-to-quality ratio of
image generation with diffusion models. We hypothesize that differences between
distilled (e.g. FLUX.1-schnell) and baseline (e.g. FLUX.1-dev) models are
consistent and, therefore, learnable within a specialized domain, like portrait
generation. We generate a synthetic paired dataset and train a fast
image-to-image translation head. Using two sets of low- and high-quality
synthetic images, our model is trained to refine the output of a distilled
generator (e.g., FLUX.1-schnell) to a level comparable to a baseline model like
FLUX.1-dev, which is more computationally intensive. Our results show that the
pipeline, which combines a distilled version of a large generative model with
our enhancement layer, delivers similar photorealistic portraits to the
baseline version with up to an 82% decrease in computational cost compared to
FLUX.1-dev. This study demonstrates the potential for improving the efficiency
of AI solutions involving large-scale image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言预训练模型（如CLIP）在实体定位和组合匹配方面表现不足，需要改进。

Method: 通过局部化对象实体和关系的子图像嵌入，动态调整全局图像嵌入，加权组合后用于相似性计算。

Result: 在Visual Genome和SVO Probes数据集上图像-文本匹配准确率提升1.5%，在Flickr30K和MS-COCO检索任务中Recall@1分别提升12%和0.4%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了CLIP在组合任务中的性能，为视觉语言模型提供了更强大的嵌入能力。

Abstract: Vision-language pretraining on large datasets of images-text pairs is one of
the main building blocks of current Vision-Language Models. While with
additional training, these models excel in various downstream tasks, including
visual question answering, image captioning, and visual commonsense reasoning.
However, a notable weakness of pretrained models like CLIP, is their inability
to perform entity grounding and compositional image and text
matching~\cite{Jiang2024ComCLIP, yang2023amc, Rajabi2023GroundedVSR,
learninglocalizeCVPR24}. In this work we propose a novel learning-free
zero-shot augmentation of CLIP embeddings that has favorable compositional
properties. We compute separate embeddings of sub-images of object entities and
relations that are localized by the state of the art open vocabulary detectors
and dynamically adjust the baseline global image embedding. % The final
embedding is obtained by computing a weighted combination of the sub-image
embeddings. The resulting embedding is then utilized for similarity computation
with text embedding, resulting in a average 1.5\% improvement in image-text
matching accuracy on the Visual Genome and SVO Probes
datasets~\cite{krishna2017visualgenome, svo}. Notably, the enhanced embeddings
demonstrate superior retrieval performance, thus achieving significant gains on
the Flickr30K and MS-COCO retrieval benchmarks~\cite{flickr30ke, mscoco},
improving the state-of-the-art Recall@1 by 12\% and 0.4\%, respectively. Our

Motivation: 当前人体姿态估计方法在准确性、计算效率和不确定性量化之间存在权衡，传统回归方法假设固定分布可能导致不确定性量化不佳，而基于热图的方法资源消耗大。

Method: 提出Continuous Flow Residual Estimation (CFRE)，将Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs)集成到回归模型中，实现动态分布适应。

Result: 实验表明，CFRE在2D和3D人体姿态估计任务中提高了准确性和不确定性量化，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: CFRE是一种有效的方法，能够平衡准确性、计算效率和不确定性量化，适用于人体姿态估计任务。

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is increasingly important for applications like
virtual reality and motion analysis, yet current methods struggle with
balancing accuracy, computational efficiency, and reliable uncertainty
quantification (UQ). Traditional regression-based methods assume fixed
distributions, which might lead to poor UQ. Heatmap-based methods effectively
model the output distribution using likelihood heatmaps, however, they demand
significant resources. To address this, we propose Continuous Flow Residual
Estimation (CFRE), an integration of Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) into
regression-based models, which allows for dynamic distribution adaptation.
Through extensive experiments, we show that CFRE leads to better accuracy and
uncertainty quantification with retained computational efficiency on both 2D
and 3D human pose estimation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因3D训练数据不足而难以泛化到未知类别，而预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）虽具有零样本泛化能力，但2D训练与3D测试分布差异限制了其3D表示能力。

Method: TeDA将3D对象投影为多视图图像，利用CLIP提取特征，并通过自信查询-目标样本对的迭代优化策略优化3D查询嵌入。同时结合多模态语言模型（InternVL）生成的文本描述，融合视觉和文本线索。

Result: 在四个开放集3D对象检索基准测试中，TeDA显著优于现有方法，包括需要大量训练的方法。在Objaverse-LVIS上的深度图实验进一步验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: TeDA是首个研究视觉语言模型在测试时间适应3D特征学习的工作，通过分布对齐和多模态融合，显著提升了3D对象检索的性能。

Abstract: Learning discriminative 3D representations that generalize well to unknown
testing categories is an emerging requirement for many real-world 3D
applications. Existing well-established methods often struggle to attain this
goal due to insufficient 3D training data from broader concepts. Meanwhile,
pre-trained large vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have shown remarkable
zero-shot generalization capabilities. Yet, they are limited in extracting
suitable 3D representations due to substantial gaps between their 2D training
and 3D testing distributions. To address these challenges, we propose
Testing-time Distribution Alignment (TeDA), a novel framework that adapts a
pretrained 2D vision-language model CLIP for unknown 3D object retrieval at
test time. To our knowledge, it is the first work that studies the test-time
adaptation of a vision-language model for 3D feature learning. TeDA projects 3D
objects into multi-view images, extracts features using CLIP, and refines 3D
query embeddings with an iterative optimization strategy by confident
query-target sample pairs in a self-boosting manner. Additionally, TeDA
integrates textual descriptions generated by a multimodal language model
(InternVL) to enhance 3D object understanding, leveraging CLIP's aligned
feature space to fuse visual and textual cues. Extensive experiments on four
open-set 3D object retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that TeDA greatly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even those requiring extensive training.
We also experimented with depth maps on Objaverse-LVIS, further validating its
effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzhichuan123/TeDA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视听情感识别（AVER）面临情感表达模糊、跨模态差异和数据标注稀缺的挑战，现有方法依赖模态特定编码器和粗粒度对齐，限制了细粒度情感建模。

Method: VAEmo分为两阶段：1）通过掩码重建和对比目标预训练统一轻量级表示网络；2）利用多模态大语言模型生成情感描述，并通过双路径对比学习对齐文本与视听表示。

Result: 在多个AVER基准测试中，VAEmo实现了最先进的性能，展示了统一编码和情感感知语义指导的优势。

Conclusion: VAEmo通过高效的两阶段设计和外部知识注入，显著提升了视听情感识别的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Audiovisual emotion recognition (AVER) aims to infer human emotions from
nonverbal visual-audio (VA) cues, offering modality-complementary and
language-agnostic advantages. However, AVER remains challenging due to the
inherent ambiguity of emotional expressions, cross-modal expressive
disparities, and the scarcity of reliably annotated data. Recent
self-supervised AVER approaches have introduced strong multimodal
representations, yet they predominantly rely on modality-specific encoders and
coarse content-level alignment, limiting fine-grained emotional semantic
modeling. To address these issues, we propose VAEmo, an efficient two-stage
framework for emotion-centric joint VA representation learning with external
knowledge injection. In Stage 1, a unified and lightweight representation
network is pre-trained on large-scale speaker-centric VA corpora via masked
reconstruction and contrastive objectives, mitigating the modality gap and
learning expressive, complementary representations without emotion labels. In
Stage 2, multimodal large language models automatically generate detailed
affective descriptions according to our well-designed chain-of-thought
prompting for only a small subset of VA samples; these rich textual semantics
are then injected by aligning their corresponding embeddings with VA
representations through dual-path contrastive learning, further bridging the
emotion gap. Extensive experiments on multiple downstream AVER benchmarks show
that VAEmo achieves state-of-the-art performance with a compact design,
highlighting the benefit of unified cross-modal encoding and emotion-aware
semantic guidance for efficient, generalizable VA emotion representations.

Abstract: Accurate dietary monitoring is essential for promoting healthier eating
habits. A key area of research is how people interact and consume food using
utensils and hands. By tracking their position and orientation, it is possible
to estimate the volume of food being consumed, or monitor eating behaviours,
highly useful insights into nutritional intake that can be more reliable than
popular methods such as self-reporting. Hence, this paper implements a system
that analyzes stationary video feed of people eating, using 6D pose estimation
to track hand and spoon movements to capture spatial position and orientation.
In doing so, we examine the performance of two state-of-the-art (SOTA) video
object segmentation (VOS) models, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and
identify main sources of error within the system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外和可见光图像在不同光照条件下各有优势，但现有融合方法未能充分利用可见光图像的颜色结构信息，且在低质量输入时性能下降。

Method: QIVIF框架包括四元数低可见性特征学习模型、四元数自适应锐化掩蔽方法和四元数分层贝叶斯融合模型。

Result: 实验表明，QIVIF在低可见性条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: QIVIF能有效融合红外和可见光图像，生成高质量融合图像。

Abstract: Visible images provide rich details and color information only under
well-lighted conditions while infrared images effectively highlight thermal
targets under challenging conditions such as low visibility and adverse
weather. Infrared-visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary
information from infrared and visible images to generate a high-quality fused
image. Existing methods exhibit critical limitations such as neglecting color
structure information in visible images and performance degradation when
processing low-quality color-visible inputs. To address these issues, we
propose a quaternion infrared-visible image fusion (QIVIF) framework to
generate high-quality fused images completely in the quaternion domain. QIVIF
proposes a quaternion low-visibility feature learning model to adaptively
extract salient thermal targets and fine-grained texture details from input
infrared and visible images respectively under diverse degraded conditions.
QIVIF then develops a quaternion adaptive unsharp masking method to adaptively
improve high-frequency feature enhancement with balanced illumination. QIVIF
further proposes a quaternion hierarchical Bayesian fusion model to integrate
infrared saliency and enhanced visible details to obtain high-quality fused
images. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our
QIVIF surpasses state-of-the-art methods under challenging low-visibility
conditions.

Abstract: Multi-focus color image fusion refers to integrating multiple partially
focused color images to create a single all-in-focus color image. However,
existing methods struggle with complex real-world scenarios due to limitations
in handling color information and intricate textures. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a quaternion multi-focus color image fusion
framework to perform high-quality color image fusion completely in the
quaternion domain. This framework introduces 1) a quaternion sparse
decomposition model to jointly learn fine-scale image details and structure
information of color images in an iterative fashion for high-precision focus
detection, 2) a quaternion base-detail fusion strategy to individually fuse
base-scale and detail-scale results across multiple color images for preserving
structure and detail information, and 3) a quaternion structural similarity
refinement strategy to adaptively select optimal patches from initial fusion
results and obtain the final fused result for preserving fine details and
ensuring spatially consistent outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖VLM模块或预训练任务，提供了一种更直接高效的监督信号解决方案，为基于指令的图像编辑提供了新颖、简单且有效的方法。

Abstract: Due to the challenges of manually collecting accurate editing data, existing
datasets are typically constructed using various automated methods, leading to
noisy supervision signals caused by the mismatch between editing instructions
and original-edited image pairs. Recent efforts attempt to improve editing
models through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on
recognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to
resolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by
constructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This
includes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the
original-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to
further enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models
exhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps,
independent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified
guide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some
challenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified
instructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals
with positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model
training using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision
effectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training
tasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to
provide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and
effective solution for instruction-based image editing. Results on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches. Compared with previous SOTA SmartEdit, we achieve 9.19%
improvements on the Real-Edit benchmark with 30x less training data and 13x
smaller model size.

TLDR: MetaScenes是一个基于真实扫描的大规模可模拟3D场景数据集，结合Scan2Sim模型，实现了自动化高质量资产替换，减少了人工设计依赖，提升了EAI研究的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景数据集依赖人工设计，成本高且难以扩展，无法满足EAI研究对高质量、多样化场景的需求。

Method: 提出MetaScenes数据集（15366个对象，831类）和Scan2Sim模型，实现自动化资产替换；设计两个基准任务验证数据集效果。

Result: MetaScenes支持更通用的智能体学习和仿真到现实应用，为EAI研究提供了新可能性。

Conclusion: MetaScenes和Scan2Sim的结合为EAI研究提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，推动了领域发展。

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) research requires high-quality, diverse 3D scenes to
effectively support skill acquisition, sim-to-real transfer, and
generalization. Achieving these quality standards, however, necessitates the
precise replication of real-world object diversity. Existing datasets
demonstrate that this process heavily relies on artist-driven designs, which
demand substantial human effort and present significant scalability challenges.
To scalably produce realistic and interactive 3D scenes, we first present
MetaScenes, a large-scale, simulatable 3D scene dataset constructed from
real-world scans, which includes 15366 objects spanning 831 fine-grained
categories. Then, we introduce Scan2Sim, a robust multi-modal alignment model,
which enables the automated, high-quality replacement of assets, thereby
eliminating the reliance on artist-driven designs for scaling 3D scenes. We
further propose two benchmarks to evaluate MetaScenes: a detailed scene
synthesis task focused on small item layouts for robotic manipulation and a
domain transfer task in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) to validate
cross-domain transfer. Results confirm MetaScene's potential to enhance EAI by
supporting more generalizable agent learning and sim-to-real applications,
introducing new possibilities for EAI research. Project website:

*Sungheon Jeong,Jihong Park,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: IEF-VAD通过合成事件表示并与RGB特征融合，提升视频异常检测性能，无需专用事件传感器或帧级标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频异常检测器仅依赖RGB帧，缺乏捕捉瞬态运动线索的能力，而IEF-VAD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: IEF-VAD通过合成事件表示，采用Student's-t似然建模噪声，应用Kalman式更新平衡模态，并迭代优化融合状态。

Result: IEF-VAD在多个真实世界异常检测基准上达到新SOTA，突显合成事件表示在强调运动线索中的价值。

Conclusion: IEF-VAD展示了合成事件表示在视频理解中的潜力，无需专用传感器即可实现鲁棒检测。

Abstract: Most existing video anomaly detectors rely solely on RGB frames, which lack
the temporal resolution needed to capture abrupt or transient motion cues, key
indicators of anomalous events. To address this limitation, we propose
Image-Event Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection (IEF-VAD), a framework that
synthesizes event representations directly from RGB videos and fuses them with
image features through a principled, uncertainty-aware process. The system (i)
models heavy-tailed sensor noise with a Student`s-t likelihood, deriving
value-level inverse-variance weights via a Laplace approximation; (ii) applies
Kalman-style frame-wise updates to balance modalities over time; and (iii)
iteratively refines the fused latent state to erase residual cross-modal noise.
Without any dedicated event sensor or frame-level labels, IEF-VAD sets a new
state of the art across multiple real-world anomaly detection benchmarks. These
findings highlight the utility of synthetic event representations in
emphasizing motion cues that are often underrepresented in RGB frames, enabling
accurate and robust video understanding across diverse applications without
requiring dedicated event sensors. Code and models are available at

### [150] [Token Coordinated Prompt Attention is Needed for Visual Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02406)
*Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua,Jiahuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为TCPA的模块，通过为不同令牌分配特定协调提示，提升ViT的表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉提示方法对所有令牌使用相同提示，忽视了不同令牌在传递判别信息中的独特作用，导致特征提取受限。

Method: 提出TCPA模块，将提示分为CLS提示和图像提示，并通过匹配函数为不同令牌分配协调提示。

Result: 实验表明，TCPA显著提升了特征的多样性和判别能力。

Conclusion: TCPA通过协调提示分配，有效提升了ViT的特征表示能力。

Abstract: Visual prompting techniques are widely used to efficiently fine-tune
pretrained Vision Transformers (ViT) by learning a small set of shared prompts
for all tokens. However, existing methods overlook the unique roles of
different tokens in conveying discriminative information and interact with all
tokens using the same prompts, thereby limiting the representational capacity
of ViT. This often leads to indistinguishable and biased prompt-extracted
features, hindering performance. To address this issue, we propose a
plug-and-play Token Coordinated Prompt Attention (TCPA) module, which assigns
specific coordinated prompts to different tokens for attention-based
interactions. Firstly, recognizing the distinct functions of CLS and image
tokens-global information aggregation and local feature extraction, we
disentangle the prompts into CLS Prompts and Image Prompts, which interact
exclusively with CLS tokens and image tokens through attention mechanisms. This
enhances their respective discriminative abilities. Furthermore, as different
image tokens correspond to distinct image patches and contain diverse
information, we employ a matching function to automatically assign coordinated
prompts to individual tokens. This enables more precise attention interactions,
improving the diversity and representational capacity of the extracted
features. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that TCPA
significantly enhances the diversity and discriminative power of the extracted
features. The code is available at

*Chaohua Li,Enhao Zhang,Chuanxing Geng,Songcan Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于图像和文本模态的新分类框架，用于CLIP等视觉语言模型的OOD检测，并讨论了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法仍依赖单模态（图像），未能充分利用CLIP的多模态特性，因此需要新的分类框架。

Method: 提出基于图像和文本模态的分类框架，将方法分为四类（OOD图像可见/不可见，OOD文本已知/未知），并区分两种训练策略。

Result: 框架更好地利用了CLIP的多模态特性，为OOD检测提供了更全面的分类视角。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注跨域整合、实际应用和理论理解，以推动CLIP类OOD检测的发展。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution detection (OOD) is a pivotal task for real-world
applications that trains models to identify samples that are distributionally
different from the in-distribution (ID) data during testing. Recent advances in
AI, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP, have revolutionized
OOD detection by shifting from traditional unimodal image detectors to
multimodal image-text detectors. This shift has inspired extensive research;
however, existing categorization schemes (e.g., few- or zero-shot types) still
rely solely on the availability of ID images, adhering to a unimodal paradigm.
To better align with CLIP's cross-modal nature, we propose a new categorization
framework rooted in both image and text modalities. Specifically, we categorize
existing methods based on how visual and textual information of OOD data is
utilized within image + text modalities, and further divide them into four
groups: OOD Images (i.e., outliers) Seen or Unseen, and OOD Texts (i.e.,
learnable vectors or class names) Known or Unknown, across two training
strategies (i.e., train-free or training-required). More importantly, we
discuss open problems in CLIP-like OOD detection and highlight promising
directions for future research, including cross-domain integration, practical
applications, and theoretical understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种顺序前向搜索算法，用于优化多模态深度学习中的融合模块插入时机，显著提升了诊断准确性并降低了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态深度学习在医学影像中融合模块的插入时机依赖手动调优或穷举搜索，效率低且无法保证最优结果。

Method: 采用顺序前向搜索算法，逐步激活和评估不同网络层的融合模块，通过验证损失比较确定最佳配置。

Result: 在两种多模态MRI数据集上验证，算法性能优于单模态基线、晚期融合及穷举融合，提升了准确性、F-score和特异性。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学影像中的多模态融合提供了高效优化框架，有助于提升临床决策和AI架构的可扩展性。

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning harnesses diverse imaging modalities, such as MRI
sequences, to enhance diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging. A key challenge
is determining the optimal timing for integrating these
modalities-specifically, identifying the network layers where fusion modules
should be inserted. Current approaches often rely on manual tuning or
exhaustive search, which are computationally expensive without any guarantee of
converging to optimal results. We propose a sequential forward search algorithm
that incrementally activates and evaluates candidate fusion modules at
different layers of a multimodal network. At each step, the algorithm retrains
from previously learned weights and compares validation loss to identify the
best-performing configuration. This process systematically reduces the search
space, enabling efficient identification of the optimal fusion timing without
exhaustively testing all possible module placements. The approach is validated
on two multimodal MRI datasets, each addressing different classification tasks.
Our algorithm consistently identified configurations that outperformed unimodal
baselines, late fusion, and a brute-force ensemble of all potential fusion
placements. These architectures demonstrated superior accuracy, F-score, and
specificity while maintaining competitive or improved AUC values. Furthermore,
the sequential nature of the search significantly reduced computational
overhead, making the optimization process more practical. By systematically
determining the optimal timing to fuse imaging modalities, our method advances
multimodal deep learning for medical imaging. It provides an efficient and
robust framework for fusion optimization, paving the way for improved clinical
decision-making and more adaptable, scalable architectures in medical AI
applications.

underscoring the broader significance of unified models like Ming-Lite-Uni on
the path toward AGI. Ming-Lite-Uni is in alpha stage and will soon be further

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于双模态输入的网络，用于提升指纹姿态估计的准确性和稳定性，解决了现有方法在大角度或小面积输入时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指纹姿态估计方法在处理大角度或小面积输入时表现不佳，尤其在智能手机屏下指纹传感器中更为明显。

Method: 结合纹理细节和粗糙轮廓的双模态输入，设计了解耦概率分布预测任务，并采用MoE特征融合机制和跨域知识转移策略。

Result: 在多个公开和私有数据集上实验表明，该方法显著优于现有SOTA方法，提升了指纹识别算法的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过双模态输入和创新的训练策略，有效提升了指纹姿态估计的性能。

Abstract: Two-dimensional pose estimation plays a crucial role in fingerprint
recognition by facilitating global alignment and reduce pose-induced
variations. However, existing methods are still unsatisfactory when handling
with large angle or small area inputs. These limitations are particularly
pronounced on fingerprints captured by under-screen fingerprint sensors in
smartphones. In this paper, we present a novel dual-modal input based network
for under-screen fingerprint pose estimation. Our approach effectively
integrates two distinct yet complementary modalities: texture details extracted
from ridge patches through the under-screen fingerprint sensor, and rough
contours derived from capacitive images obtained via the touch screen. This
collaborative integration endows our network with more comprehensive and
discriminative information, substantially improving the accuracy and stability
of pose estimation. A decoupled probability distribution prediction task is
designed, instead of the traditional supervised forms of numerical regression
or heatmap voting, to facilitate the training process. Additionally, we
incorporate a Mixture of Experts (MoE) based feature fusion mechanism and a
relationship driven cross-domain knowledge transfer strategy to further
strengthen feature extraction and fusion capabilities. Extensive experiments
are conducted on several public datasets and two private datasets. The results
indicate that our method is significantly superior to previous state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and remarkably boosts the recognition ability of fingerprint
recognition algorithms. Our code is available at

*Asma Brazi,Boris Meden,Fabrice Mayran de Chamisso,Steve Bourgeois,Vincent Lepetit*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: Corr2Distrib是一种基于对应关系的方法，首次通过RGB图像估计6D相机姿态分布，解决视觉模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称性和遮挡导致视觉模糊性，产生多个有效姿态，现有方法未充分利用局部对应关系。

Method: Corr2Distrib学习对称感知的3D点表示，生成旋转假设，并通过PnP和姿态评分优化为6D姿态分布。

Result: 在复杂非合成场景中，Corr2Distrib在姿态分布估计和单姿态估计上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Corr2Distrib展示了基于对应关系方法的潜力，解决了视觉模糊性问题。

Abstract: We introduce Corr2Distrib, the first correspondence-based method which
estimates a 6D camera pose distribution from an RGB image, explaining the
observations. Indeed, symmetries and occlusions introduce visual ambiguities,
leading to multiple valid poses. While a few recent methods tackle this
problem, they do not rely on local correspondences which, according to the BOP
Challenge, are currently the most effective way to estimate a single 6DoF pose
solution. Using correspondences to estimate a pose distribution is not
straightforward, since ambiguous correspondences induced by visual ambiguities
drastically decrease the performance of PnP. With Corr2Distrib, we turn these
ambiguities into an advantage to recover all valid poses. Corr2Distrib first
learns a symmetry-aware representation for each 3D point on the object's
surface, characterized by a descriptor and a local frame. This representation
enables the generation of 3DoF rotation hypotheses from single 2D-3D
correspondences. Next, we refine these hypotheses into a 6DoF pose distribution
using PnP and pose scoring. Our experimental evaluations on complex
non-synthetic scenes show that Corr2Distrib outperforms state-of-the-art
solutions for both pose distribution estimation and single pose estimation from
an RGB image, demonstrating the potential of correspondences-based approaches.

<details>

Motivation: 无监督可见光-红外行人重识别（UVI-ReID）面临模态差异和缺乏监督的挑战，现有方法的伪标签噪声问题阻碍了模型学习。

Method: 提出RoDE框架，包含Robust Adaptive Learning（RAL）机制、双模型交替训练策略和Cluster Consistency Matching（CCM）方法。

Result: 在三个基准测试上验证了RoDE的有效性。

Conclusion: RoDE通过动态学习和双模型策略显著减轻了伪标签噪声的影响，提升了UVI-ReID的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (UVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve pedestrian images across different modalities without costly
annotations, but faces challenges due to the modality gap and lack of
supervision. Existing methods often adopt self-training with
clustering-generated pseudo-labels but implicitly assume these labels are
always correct. In practice, however, this assumption fails due to inevitable
pseudo-label noise, which hinders model learning. To address this, we introduce
a new learning paradigm that explicitly considers Pseudo-Label Noise (PLN),
characterized by three key challenges: noise overfitting, error accumulation,
and noisy cluster correspondence. To this end, we propose a novel Robust
Duality Learning framework (RoDE) for UVI-ReID to mitigate the effects of noisy
pseudo-labels. First, to combat noise overfitting, a Robust Adaptive Learning
mechanism (RAL) is proposed to dynamically emphasize clean samples while
down-weighting noisy ones. Second, to alleviate error accumulation-where the
model reinforces its own mistakes-RoDE employs dual distinct models that are
alternately trained using pseudo-labels from each other, encouraging diversity
and preventing collapse. However, this dual-model strategy introduces
misalignment between clusters across models and modalities, creating noisy
cluster correspondence. To resolve this, we introduce Cluster Consistency
Matching (CCM), which aligns clusters across models and modalities by measuring
cross-cluster similarity. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of RoDE.

Abstract: Recent years have seen remarkable progress in both multimodal understanding
models and image generation models. Despite their respective successes, these
two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural
paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal
understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image
generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified
frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new
capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for
unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains
pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts
toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future
research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements
in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we
review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural
paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that
fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the
structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally,
we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering
resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing
this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and
data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid
advancements and will regularly update this survey. Our goal is to inspire
further research and provide a valuable reference for the community. The

Abstract: This work introduces RGBX-DiffusionDet, an object detection framework
extending the DiffusionDet model to fuse the heterogeneous 2D data (X) with RGB
imagery via an adaptive multimodal encoder. To enable cross-modal interaction,
we design the dynamic channel reduction within a convolutional block attention
module (DCR-CBAM), which facilitates cross-talk between subnetworks by
dynamically highlighting salient channel features. Furthermore, the dynamic
multi-level aggregation block (DMLAB) is proposed to refine spatial feature
representations through adaptive multiscale fusion. Finally, novel
regularization losses that enforce channel saliency and spatial selectivity are
introduced, leading to compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive
experiments using RGB-Depth (KITTI), a novel annotated RGB-Polarimetric
dataset, and RGB-Infrared (M$^3$FD) benchmark dataset were conducted. We
demonstrate consistent superiority of the proposed approach over the baseline
RGB-only DiffusionDet. The modular architecture maintains the original decoding
complexity, ensuring efficiency. These results establish the proposed
RGBX-DiffusionDet as a flexible multimodal object detection approach, providing
new insights into integrating diverse 2D sensing modalities into
diffusion-based detection pipelines.

Abstract: Event cameras and LiDARs provide complementary yet distinct data:

demonstrate that DELTA sets a new state of the art in the event-based depth
estimation problem, and that it is able to reduce the errors up to four times
for close ranges compared to the previous SOTA.

exceptional performance in identifying and segmenting anomalous regions while
maintaining fast inference speeds. However, anomaly
classification-distinguishing different types of anomalies-remains largely
unexplored despite its critical importance in real-world inspection tasks. To
address this gap, we propose VELM, a novel LLM-based pipeline for anomaly
classification. Given the critical importance of inference speed, we first
apply an unsupervised anomaly detection method as a vision expert to assess the
normality of an observation. If an anomaly is detected, the LLM then classifies
its type. A key challenge in developing and evaluating anomaly classification
models is the lack of precise annotations of anomaly classes in existing
datasets. To address this limitation, we introduce MVTec-AC and VisA-AC,
refined versions of the widely used MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, which include
accurate anomaly class labels for rigorous evaluation. Our approach achieves a
state-of-the-art anomaly classification accuracy of 80.4% on MVTec-AD,
exceeding the prior baselines by 5%, and 84% on MVTec-AC, demonstrating the
effectiveness of VELM in understanding and categorizing anomalies. We hope our
methodology and benchmark inspire further research in anomaly classification,
helping bridge the gap between detection and comprehensive anomaly
characterization.

Conclusion: MCCD为复杂场景生成提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown excellent performance in text-to-image
generation. Nevertheless, existing methods often suffer from performance
bottlenecks when handling complex prompts that involve multiple objects,
characteristics, and relations. Therefore, we propose a Multi-agent
Collaboration-based Compositional Diffusion (MCCD) for text-to-image generation
for complex scenes. Specifically, we design a multi-agent collaboration-based
scene parsing module that generates an agent system comprising multiple agents
with distinct tasks, utilizing MLLMs to extract various scene elements
effectively. In addition, Hierarchical Compositional diffusion utilizes a
Gaussian mask and filtering to refine bounding box regions and enhance objects
through region enhancement, resulting in the accurate and high-fidelity
generation of complex scenes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our
MCCD significantly improves the performance of the baseline models in a
training-free manner, providing a substantial advantage in complex scene
generation.

Motivation: 真实内窥镜图像的标注困难，合成数据训练模型泛化能力差，需解决纹理真实性与场景结构保持的矛盾。

Result: 生成图像在纹理和结构上优于现有方法，成功用于训练折叠分割模型，无需真实标注数据。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决合成数据泛化问题，公开数据集推动折叠分割任务研究。

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of anatomical landmarks in endoscopic images can
provide assistance to doctors and surgeons for diagnosis, treatments or medical
training. However, obtaining the annotations required to train commonly used
supervised learning methods is a tedious and difficult task, in particular for
real images. While ground truth annotations are easier to obtain for synthetic
data, models trained on such data often do not generalize well to real data.
Generative approaches can add realistic texture to it, but face difficulties to
maintain the structure of the original scene. The main contribution in this
work is a novel image translation model that adds realistic texture to
simulated endoscopic images while keeping the key scene layout information. Our
approach produces realistic images in different endoscopy scenarios. We
demonstrate these images can effectively be used to successfully train a model
for a challenging end task without any real labeled data. In particular, we
demonstrate our approach for the task of fold segmentation in colonoscopy
images. Folds are key anatomical landmarks that can occlude parts of the colon
mucosa and possible polyps. Our approach generates realistic images maintaining
the shape and location of the original folds, after the
image-style-translation, better than existing methods. We run experiments both
on a novel simulated dataset for fold segmentation, and real data from the
EndoMapper (EM) dataset. All our new generated data and new EM metadata is
being released to facilitate further research, as no public benchmark is
currently available for the task of fold segmentation.

Leveraging mobile device cameras and lightweight pose estimation
(PoseNet/TensorFlow Lite), the system extracts body keypoints, computes joint
angles, and compares them with standardized motions to deliver real-time
corrective feedback. To incentivize participation, it dynamically maps users'
movements (such as joint angles and velocity) to customizable fireworks
animations, rewarding improved accuracy with richer visual effects. Experiments

joint angle errors from 21.3 degrees to 9.8 degrees (p < 0.01) over four
sessions, with 93.4 percent of users affirming its exercise-promoting efficacy
and 85.4 percent praising its entertainment value. The system operates without
predefined motion templates or specialised hardware, enabling seamless

Result: 在三个MedVQA数据集上显著提升准确性，并实现真实因果关联。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MedVQA中的跨模态偏差问题，提升了问答的精确性。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) aims to answer medical questions
according to medical images. However, the complexity of medical data leads to
confounders that are difficult to observe, so bias between images and questions
is inevitable. Such cross-modal bias makes it challenging to infer medically
meaningful answers. In this work, we propose a causal inference framework for
the MedVQA task, which effectively eliminates the relative confounding effect
between the image and the question to ensure the precision of the
question-answering (QA) session. We are the first to introduce a novel causal
graph structure that represents the interaction between visual and textual
elements, explicitly capturing how different questions influence visual
features. During optimization, we apply the mutual information to discover
spurious correlations and propose a multi-variable resampling front-door
adjustment method to eliminate the relative confounding effect, which aims to
align features based on their true causal relevance to the question-answering
task. In addition, we also introduce a prompt strategy that combines multiple
prompt forms to improve the model's ability to understand complex medical data
and answer accurately. Extensive experiments on three MedVQA datasets
demonstrate that 1) our method significantly improves the accuracy of MedVQA,
and 2) our method achieves true causal correlations in the face of complex
medical data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目深度估计中，相对深度缺乏尺度信息，而绝对深度恢复对实际任务至关重要。文本信息可用于恢复尺度，但不同描述会影响结果。

Method: VGLD结合图像语义信息与文本描述，稳定文本影响，输出线性变换参数，将相对深度图转换为绝对尺度深度。

Result: 在多个数据集（NYUv2、KITTI）和模型（MiDas、DepthAnything）上验证，VGLD作为通用对齐模块表现优异，支持零样本场景。

Conclusion: VGLD通过语义信息解决文本模糊性，稳健恢复深度尺度，适用于多种场景和模型。

Abstract: We propose a robust method for monocular depth scale recovery. Monocular
depth estimation can be divided into two main directions: (1) relative depth
estimation, which provides normalized or inverse depth without scale
information, and (2) metric depth estimation, which involves recovering depth
with absolute scale. To obtain absolute scale information for practical
downstream tasks, utilizing textual information to recover the scale of a
relative depth map is a highly promising approach. However, since a single
image can have multiple descriptions from different perspectives or with
varying styles, it has been shown that different textual descriptions can
significantly affect the scale recovery process. To address this issue, our
method, VGLD, stabilizes the influence of textual information by incorporating
high-level semantic information from the corresponding image alongside the
textual description. This approach resolves textual ambiguities and robustly
outputs a set of linear transformation parameters (scalars) that can be
globally applied to the relative depth map, ultimately generating depth
predictions with metric-scale accuracy. We validate our method across several
popular relative depth models(MiDas, DepthAnything), using both indoor scenes
(NYUv2) and outdoor scenes (KITTI). Our results demonstrate that VGLD functions
as a universal alignment module when trained on multiple datasets, achieving
strong performance even in zero-shot scenarios. Code is available at:

Abstract: Learned video coding (LVC) has recently achieved superior coding performance.
In this paper, we model the rate-quality (R-Q) relationship for learned video
coding by a parametric function. We learn a neural network, termed RQNet, to
characterize the relationship between the bitrate and quality level according
to video content and coding context. The predicted (R,Q) results are further
integrated with those from previously coded frames using the least-squares
method to determine the parameters of our R-Q model on-the-fly. Compared to the
conventional approaches, our method accurately estimates the R-Q relationship,
enabling the online adaptation of model parameters to enhance both flexibility
and precision. Experimental results show that our R-Q model achieves
significantly smaller bitrate deviations than the baseline method on commonly
used datasets with minimal additional complexity.

Abstract: We explore Generalizable Tumor Segmentation, aiming to train a single model
for zero-shot tumor segmentation across diverse anatomical regions. Existing
methods face limitations related to segmentation quality, scalability, and the
range of applicable imaging modalities. In this paper, we uncover the potential
of the internal representations within frozen medical foundation diffusion
models as highly efficient zero-shot learners for tumor segmentation by
introducing a novel framework named DiffuGTS. DiffuGTS creates anomaly-aware
open-vocabulary attention maps based on text prompts to enable generalizable
anomaly segmentation without being restricted by a predefined training category
list. To further improve and refine anomaly segmentation masks, DiffuGTS
leverages the diffusion model, transforming pathological regions into
high-quality pseudo-healthy counterparts through latent space inpainting, and
applies a novel pixel-level and feature-level residual learning approach,
resulting in segmentation masks with significantly enhanced quality and
generalization. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets and seven tumor
categories demonstrate the superior performance of our method, surpassing
current state-of-the-art models across multiple zero-shot settings. Codes are

Abstract: Retinal image registration, particularly for color fundus images, is a
challenging yet essential task with diverse clinical applications. Existing
registration methods for color fundus images typically rely on keypoints and
descriptors for alignment; however, a significant limitation is their reliance
on labeled data, which is particularly scarce in the medical domain.
  In this work, we present a novel unsupervised registration pipeline that
entirely eliminates the need for labeled data. Our approach is based on the
principle that locations with distinctive descriptors constitute reliable
keypoints. This fully inverts the conventional state-of-the-art approach,
conditioning the detector on the descriptor rather than the opposite.
  First, we propose an innovative descriptor learning method that operates
without keypoint detection or any labels, generating descriptors for arbitrary
locations in retinal images. Next, we introduce a novel, label-free keypoint
detector network which works by estimating descriptor performance directly from
the input image.
  We validate our method through a comprehensive evaluation on four hold-out
datasets, demonstrating that our unsupervised descriptor outperforms
state-of-the-art supervised descriptors and that our unsupervised detector
significantly outperforms existing unsupervised detection methods. Finally, our
full registration pipeline achieves performance comparable to the leading
supervised methods, while not employing any labeled data. Additionally, the
label-free nature and design of our method enable direct adaptation to other
domains and modalities.

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain tissue segmentation and biometric analysis are essential
for studying brain development in utero. The FeTA Challenge 2024 advanced
automated fetal brain MRI analysis by introducing biometry prediction as a new
task alongside tissue segmentation. For the first time, our diverse
multi-centric test set included data from a new low-field (0.55T) MRI dataset.
Evaluation metrics were also expanded to include the topology-specific Euler
characteristic difference (ED). Sixteen teams submitted segmentation methods,
most of which performed consistently across both high- and low-field scans.
However, longitudinal trends indicate that segmentation accuracy may be
reaching a plateau, with results now approaching inter-rater variability. The
ED metric uncovered topological differences that were missed by conventional
metrics, while the low-field dataset achieved the highest segmentation scores,
highlighting the potential of affordable imaging systems when paired with
high-quality reconstruction. Seven teams participated in the biometry task, but
most methods failed to outperform a simple baseline that predicted measurements
based solely on gestational age, underscoring the challenge of extracting
reliable biometric estimates from image data alone. Domain shift analysis
identified image quality as the most significant factor affecting model
generalization, with super-resolution pipelines also playing a substantial
role. Other factors, such as gestational age, pathology, and acquisition site,
had smaller, though still measurable, effects. Overall, FeTA 2024 offers a
comprehensive benchmark for multi-class segmentation and biometry estimation in
fetal brain MRI, underscoring the need for data-centric approaches, improved
topological evaluation, and greater dataset diversity to enable clinically
robust and generalizable AI tools.

Abstract: Current color fundus image registration approaches are limited, among other
things, by the lack of labeled data, which is even more significant in the
medical domain, motivating the use of unsupervised learning. Therefore, in this
work, we develop a novel unsupervised descriptor learning method that does not
rely on keypoint detection. This enables the resulting descriptor network to be
agnostic to the keypoint detector used during the registration inference.
  To validate this approach, we perform an extensive and comprehensive
comparison on the reference public retinal image registration dataset.
Additionally, we test our method with multiple keypoint detectors of varied
nature, even proposing some novel ones. Our results demonstrate that the
proposed approach offers accurate registration, not incurring in any
performance loss versus supervised methods. Additionally, it demonstrates
accurate performance regardless of the keypoint detector used. Thus, this work
represents a notable step towards leveraging unsupervised learning in the
medical domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂环境中，无人机系统需要准确检测微小物体，但直接放大图像会增加计算成本和负样本数量，降低检测性能。

Method: DPNet采用灵活的降采样策略，通过引入动态因子（df）调整特征图分辨率，并设计轻量级预测器和自适应归一化模块（ANM）实现输入感知降采样。

Result: 在TinyCOCO和TinyPerson数据集上，DPNet分别节省了35%和25%的计算量（GFLOPs），同时保持检测性能。

Conclusion: DPNet通过动态分配计算资源，在检测精度和效率之间取得了平衡，适用于无人机系统中的微小物体检测。

Abstract: In unmanned aerial systems, especially in complex environments, accurately
detecting tiny objects is crucial. Resizing images is a common strategy to
improve detection accuracy, particularly for small objects. However, simply
enlarging images significantly increases computational costs and the number of
negative samples, severely degrading detection performance and limiting its
applicability. This paper proposes a Dynamic Pooling Network (DPNet) for tiny
object detection to mitigate these issues. DPNet employs a flexible
down-sampling strategy by introducing a factor (df) to relax the fixed
downsampling process of the feature map to an adjustable one. Furthermore, we
design a lightweight predictor to predict df for each input image, which is
used to decrease the resolution of feature maps in the backbone. Thus, we
achieve input-aware downsampling. We also design an Adaptive Normalization
Module (ANM) to make a unified detector compatible with different dfs. A
guidance loss supervises the predictor's training. DPNet dynamically allocates
computing resources to trade off between detection accuracy and efficiency.
Experiments on the TinyCOCO and TinyPerson datasets show that DPNet can save
over 35% and 25% GFLOPs, respectively, while maintaining comparable detection
performance. The code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现实世界步态识别需要开放集注册，现有方法在封闭集条件下表现良好，但开放集场景下效果有限。

Result: 在CASIA-B和PsyMo数据集上验证，方法灵活、准确且数据扩展性优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在开放集步态注册中表现优异，具有通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Gait recognition has emerged as a powerful tool for unobtrusive and
long-range identity analysis, with growing relevance in surveillance and
monitoring applications. Although recent advances in deep learning and
large-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate recognition under closed-set
conditions, real-world deployment demands open-set gait enrollment, which means
determining whether a new gait sample corresponds to a known identity or
represents a previously unseen individual. In this work, we introduce a
transformer-based framework for open-set gait enrollment that is both
dataset-agnostic and recognition-architecture-agnostic. Our method leverages a
SetTransformer to make enrollment decisions based on the embedding of a probe
sample and a context set drawn from the gallery, without requiring
task-specific thresholds or retraining for new environments. By decoupling
enrollment from the main recognition pipeline, our model is generalized across
different datasets, gallery sizes, and identity distributions. We propose an
evaluation protocol that uses existing datasets in different ratios of
identities and walks per identity. We instantiate our method using
skeleton-based gait representations and evaluate it on two benchmark datasets
(CASIA-B and PsyMo), using embeddings from three state-of-the-art recognition
models (GaitGraph, GaitFormer, and GaitPT). We show that our method is
flexible, is able to accurately perform enrollment in different scenarios, and
scales better with data compared to traditional approaches. We will make the
code and dataset scenarios publicly available.

Method: 提出MUSAR框架，包括去偏双联学习（构建单主体图像对）和动态注意力路由机制（解耦多主体表示）。

Result: 实验表明MUSAR在图像质量、主体一致性和交互自然性上优于现有方法，即使仅使用单主体数据。

Conclusion: MUSAR为多主体定制提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Current multi-subject customization approaches encounter two critical
challenges: the difficulty in acquiring diverse multi-subject training data,
and attribute entanglement across different subjects. To bridge these gaps, we
propose MUSAR - a simple yet effective framework to achieve robust
multi-subject customization while requiring only single-subject training data.
Firstly, to break the data limitation, we introduce debiased diptych learning.
It constructs diptych training pairs from single-subject images to facilitate
multi-subject learning, while actively correcting the distribution bias
introduced by diptych construction via static attention routing and dual-branch
LoRA. Secondly, to eliminate cross-subject entanglement, we introduce dynamic
attention routing mechanism, which adaptively establishes bijective mappings
between generated images and conditional subjects. This design not only
achieves decoupling of multi-subject representations but also maintains
scalable generalization performance with increasing reference subjects.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our MUSAR outperforms existing
methods - even those trained on multi-subject dataset - in image quality,
subject consistency, and interaction naturalness, despite requiring only
single-subject dataset.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have rapidly advanced, enabling
high-quality image generation conditioned on textual prompts. However, the
growing trend of fine-tuning pre-trained models for personalization raises
serious concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To combat this, dataset
ownership verification (DOV) has emerged as a solution, embedding watermarks
into the fine-tuning datasets using backdoor techniques. These watermarks
remain inactive under benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when
triggered. Despite the promise of DOV for T2I diffusion models, its robustness
against copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we
explore how attackers can bypass these mechanisms through CEA, allowing models
to circumvent watermarks even when trained on watermarked datasets. We propose
the first copyright evasion attack (i.e., CEAT2I) specifically designed to
undermine DOV in T2I diffusion models. Concretely, our CEAT2I comprises three
stages: watermarked sample detection, trigger identification, and efficient
watermark mitigation. A key insight driving our approach is that T2I models
exhibit faster convergence on watermarked samples during the fine-tuning,
evident through intermediate feature deviation. Leveraging this, CEAT2I can
reliably detect the watermarked samples. Then, we iteratively ablate tokens
from the prompts of detected watermarked samples and monitor shifts in
intermediate features to pinpoint the exact trigger tokens. Finally, we adopt a
closed-form concept erasure method to remove the injected watermark. Extensive
experiments show that our CEAT2I effectively evades DOV mechanisms while
preserving model performance.

TLDR: 论文主张在生态/生物数据集中使用应用特定指标评估模型性能，而非仅依赖机器学习指标，并通过两个案例研究支持这一观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉资源多关注机器学习指标，而忽视了模型在下游分析中的实际影响，需改进评估方式以更好地服务于应用场景。

Method: 通过两个案例研究：(1)使用视频行为分类器估计黑猩猩丰度和密度，(2)使用3D姿态估计器估计鸽子头部旋转，对比机器学习指标与应用特定指标的表现。

Result: 研究发现，即使机器学习指标表现优异（如87% mAP），模型生成的数据仍可能导致与专家数据不一致的丰度估计；姿态估计的高性能模型也未产生最准确的鸽子视线方向推断。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究者整合应用特定指标，以便在模型的下游应用场景中进行基准测试，促进模型更好地融入实际工作流程。

Abstract: Computer vision methods have demonstrated considerable potential to
streamline ecological and biological workflows, with a growing number of
datasets and models becoming available to the research community. However,
these resources focus predominantly on evaluation using machine learning
metrics, with relatively little emphasis on how their application impacts
downstream analysis. We argue that models should be evaluated using
application-specific metrics that directly represent model performance in the
context of its final use case. To support this argument, we present two
disparate case studies: (1) estimating chimpanzee abundance and density with
camera trap distance sampling when using a video-based behaviour classifier and
(2) estimating head rotation in pigeons using a 3D posture estimator. We show
that even models with strong machine learning performance (e.g., 87% mAP) can
yield data that leads to discrepancies in abundance estimates compared to
expert-derived data. Similarly, the highest-performing models for posture
estimation do not produce the most accurate inferences of gaze direction in
pigeons. Motivated by these findings, we call for researchers to integrate
application-specific metrics in ecological/biological datasets, allowing for
models to be benchmarked in the context of their downstream application and to
facilitate better integration of models into application workflows.

Motivation: 现有方法需要复杂的外部表示训练框架或依赖大规模预训练模型，而扩散变换器的独特判别过程可以内部提供表示指导。

Method: SRA通过自蒸馏方式，将高噪声早期层的潜在表示与低噪声后期层的表示对齐，逐步增强表示学习。

Result: 实验表明，SRA在DiTs和SiTs上表现一致提升，优于复杂外部框架，且性能接近依赖强大外部表示先验的方法。

Conclusion: SRA是一种简单有效的方法，能够在生成训练中提升表示学习，无需外部组件。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that learning a meaningful internal
representation can both accelerate generative training and enhance generation
quality of the diffusion transformers. However, existing approaches necessitate
to either introduce an additional and complex representation training framework
or rely on a large-scale, pre-trained representation foundation model to
provide representation guidance during the original generative training
process. In this study, we posit that the unique discriminative process
inherent to diffusion transformers enables them to offer such guidance without
requiring external representation components. We therefore propose
Self-Representation A}lignment (SRA), a simple yet straightforward method that
obtain representation guidance through a self-distillation manner.
Specifically, SRA aligns the output latent representation of the diffusion
transformer in earlier layer with higher noise to that in later layer with
lower noise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning during
only generative training process. Experimental results indicate that applying
SRA to DiTs and SiTs yields consistent performance improvements. Moreover, SRA
not only significantly outperforms approaches relying on auxiliary, complex
representation training frameworks but also achieves performance comparable to
methods that heavily dependent on powerful external representation priors.

Result: 实验表明Scenethesis能生成多样、真实且物理合理的3D场景。

Conclusion: Scenethesis对虚拟内容创作、仿真环境和具身AI研究具有重要价值。

Abstract: Synthesizing interactive 3D scenes from text is essential for gaming, virtual
reality, and embodied AI. However, existing methods face several challenges.
Learning-based approaches depend on small-scale indoor datasets, limiting the
scene diversity and layout complexity. While large language models (LLMs) can
leverage diverse text-domain knowledge, they struggle with spatial realism,
often producing unnatural object placements that fail to respect common sense.
Our key insight is that vision perception can bridge this gap by providing
realistic spatial guidance that LLMs lack. To this end, we introduce
Scenethesis, a training-free agentic framework that integrates LLM-based scene
planning with vision-guided layout refinement. Given a text prompt, Scenethesis
first employs an LLM to draft a coarse layout. A vision module then refines it
by generating an image guidance and extracting scene structure to capture
inter-object relations. Next, an optimization module iteratively enforces
accurate pose alignment and physical plausibility, preventing artifacts like
object penetration and instability. Finally, a judge module verifies spatial
coherence. Comprehensive experiments show that Scenethesis generates diverse,
realistic, and physically plausible 3D interactive scenes, making it valuable
for virtual content creation, simulation environments, and embodied AI
research.

Conclusion: OT-Talk通过最优传输和几何特征提取，实现了更自然和准确的面部动画，为AR/VR等领域提供了新方法。

Abstract: Animating 3D head meshes using audio inputs has significant applications in
AR/VR, gaming, and entertainment through 3D avatars. However, bridging the
modality gap between speech signals and facial dynamics remains a challenge,
often resulting in incorrect lip syncing and unnatural facial movements. To
address this, we propose OT-Talk, the first approach to leverage optimal
transportation to optimize the learning model in talking head animation.
Building on existing learning frameworks, we utilize a pre-trained Hubert model
to extract audio features and a transformer model to process temporal
sequences. Unlike previous methods that focus solely on vertex coordinates or
displacements, we introduce Chebyshev Graph Convolution to extract geometric
features from triangulated meshes. To measure mesh dissimilarities, we go
beyond traditional mesh reconstruction errors and velocity differences between
adjacent frames. Instead, we represent meshes as probability measures and
approximate their surfaces. This allows us to leverage the sliced Wasserstein
distance for modeling mesh variations. This approach facilitates the learning
of smooth and accurate facial motions, resulting in coherent and natural facial
animations. Our experiments on two public audio-mesh datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques both quantitatively and
qualitatively in terms of mesh reconstruction accuracy and temporal alignment.
In addition, we conducted a user perception study with 20 volunteers to further
assess the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Point cloud surface representation is a fundamental problem in computer
graphics and vision. This paper presents a machine learning approach for
approximating the signed distance function (SDF) of a point cloud using sparse
ellipsoidal radial basis function networks, enabling a compact and accurate
surface representation. Given the SDF values defined on the grid points
constructed from the point cloud, our method approximates the SDF accurately
with as few ellipsoidal radial basis functions (ERBFs) as possible, i.e.,
represent the SDF of a point cloud by sparse ERBFs. To balance sparsity and
approximation precision, a dynamic multi-objective optimization strategy is
introduced, which adaptively adds the regularization terms and jointly
optimizes the weights, centers, shapes, and orientations of ERBFs. To improve
computational efficiency, a nearest-neighbor-based data structure is employed,
restricting function calculations to points near each Gaussian kernel center.
The computations for each kernel are further parallelized on CUDA, which
significantly improves the optimization speed. Additionally, a hierarchical
octree-based refinement strategy is designed for training. Specifically, the
initialization and optimization of network parameters are conducted using
coarse grid points in the octree lattice structure. Subsequently, fine lattice
points are progressively incorporated to accelerate model convergence and
enhance training efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous sparse representation
approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. The
corresponding code is publicly available at

Method: 引入AdaParse，结合直接偏好优化（DPO）和资源调度，动态选择解析器。

Result: 相比现有方法，吞吐量提升17倍，准确性提高0.2%。

Conclusion: AdaParse高效且可扩展，适用于大规模科学文档解析，支持高质量数据集构建。

Abstract: Language models for scientific tasks are trained on text from scientific
publications, most distributed as PDFs that require parsing. PDF parsing
approaches range from inexpensive heuristics (for simple documents) to
computationally intensive ML-driven systems (for complex or degraded ones). The
choice of the "best" parser for a particular document depends on its
computational cost and the accuracy of its output. To address these issues, we
introduce an Adaptive Parallel PDF Parsing and Resource Scaling Engine
(AdaParse), a data-driven strategy for assigning an appropriate parser to each
document. We enlist scientists to select preferred parser outputs and
incorporate this information through direct preference optimization (DPO) into
AdaParse, thereby aligning its selection process with human judgment. AdaParse
then incorporates hardware requirements and predicted accuracy of each parser
to orchestrate computational resources efficiently for large-scale parsing
campaigns. We demonstrate that AdaParse, when compared to state-of-the-art
parsers, improves throughput by $17\times$ while still achieving comparable
accuracy (0.2 percent better) on a benchmark set of 1000 scientific documents.
AdaParse's combination of high accuracy and parallel scalability makes it
feasible to parse large-scale scientific document corpora to support the
development of high-quality, trillion-token-scale text datasets. The
implementation is available at https://github.com/7shoe/AdaParse/

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have predominantly focused on

we propose a unified multi-granularity multimodal retrieval framework tailored
for two benchmark tasks: MMDocIR and M2KR. Our approach integrates hierarchical

textual and visual modalities. By leveraging off-the-shelf vision-language

demonstrates robust performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning.
Experimental evaluations reveal that incorporating layout-aware search and

reproducible solutions in advancing multimodal document retrieval systems.

Abstract: Personalized image generation is crucial for improving the user experience,
as it renders reference images into preferred ones according to user visual
preferences. Although effective, existing methods face two main issues. First,
existing methods treat all items in the user historical sequence equally when
extracting user preferences, overlooking the varying semantic similarities
between historical items and the reference item. Disproportionately high
weights for low-similarity items distort users' visual preferences for the
reference item. Second, existing methods heavily rely on consistency between
generated and reference images to optimize the generation, which leads to
underfitting user preferences and hinders personalization. To address these
issues, we propose Retrieval Augment Personalized Image GenerAtion guided by
Recommendation (RAGAR). Our approach uses a retrieval mechanism to assign
different weights to historical items according to their similarities to the
reference item, thereby extracting more refined users' visual preferences for
the reference item. Then we introduce a novel rank task based on the
multi-modal ranking model to optimize the personalization of the generated
images instead of forcing depend on consistency. Extensive experiments and
human evaluations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAR achieves
significant improvements in both personalization and semantic metrics compared
to five baselines.

Result: YODA在多种多模态数据集上表现优异，生成的图像在临床任务中可替代或优于实际采集的图像。

Conclusion: YODA挑战了扩散模型在MIT中的优势假设，为医学图像翻译的实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The acquisition of information-rich images within a limited time budget is
crucial in medical imaging. Medical image translation (MIT) can help enhance
and supplement existing datasets by generating synthetic images from acquired
data. While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have
achieved remarkable success in natural image generation, their benefits -
creativity and image realism - do not necessarily transfer to medical
applications where highly accurate anatomical information is required. In fact,
the imitation of acquisition noise or content hallucination hinder clinical
utility. Here, we introduce YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a novel
2.5D diffusion-based framework for volumetric MIT. YODA unites diffusion and
regression paradigms to produce realistic or noise-free outputs. Furthermore,
we propose Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) DM sampling, which draws
inspiration from MRI signal averaging. ExpA-sampling suppresses generated noise
and, thus, eliminates noise from biasing the evaluation of image quality.
Through extensive experiments on four diverse multi-modal datasets - comprising
multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we show that diffusion and
regression sampling yield similar results in practice. As such, the
computational overhead of diffusion sampling does not provide systematic
benefits in medical information translation. Building on these insights, we
demonstrate that YODA outperforms several state-of-the-art GAN and DM methods.
Notably, YODA-generated images are shown to be interchangeable with, or even
superior to, physical acquisitions for several downstream tasks. Our findings
challenge the presumed advantages of DMs in MIT and pave the way for the
practical application of MIT in medical imaging.

Abstract: Cancer survival prediction using multi-modal medical imaging presents a
critical challenge in oncology, mainly due to the vulnerability of deep
learning models to noise and protocol variations across imaging centers.
Current approaches struggle to extract consistent features from heterogeneous
CT and PET images, limiting their clinical applicability. We address these
challenges by introducing RobSurv, a robust deep-learning framework that
leverages vector quantization for resilient multi-modal feature learning. The
key innovation of our approach lies in its dual-path architecture: one path
maps continuous imaging features to learned discrete codebooks for
noise-resistant representation, while the parallel path preserves fine-grained
details through continuous feature processing. This dual representation is
integrated through a novel patch-wise fusion mechanism that maintains local
spatial relationships while capturing global context via Transformer-based
processing. In extensive evaluations across three diverse datasets (HECKTOR,
H\&N1, and NSCLC Radiogenomics), RobSurv demonstrates superior performance,
achieving concordance index of 0.771, 0.742, and 0.734 respectively -
significantly outperforming existing methods. Most notably, our model maintains
robust performance even under severe noise conditions, with performance
degradation of only 3.8-4.5\% compared to 8-12\% in baseline methods. These
results, combined with strong generalization across different cancer types and
imaging protocols, establish RobSurv as a promising solution for reliable
clinical prognosis that can enhance treatment planning and patient care.

Abstract: Stroke is a major public health problem, affecting millions worldwide. Deep
learning has recently demonstrated promise for enhancing the diagnosis and risk
prediction of stroke. However, existing methods rely on costly medical imaging
modalities, such as computed tomography. Recent studies suggest that retinal
imaging could offer a cost-effective alternative for cerebrovascular health
assessment due to the shared clinical pathways between the retina and the
brain. Hence, this study explores the impact of leveraging retinal images and
clinical data for stroke detection and risk prediction. We propose a multimodal
deep neural network that processes Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and
infrared reflectance retinal scans, combined with clinical data, such as
demographics, vital signs, and diagnosis codes. We pretrained our model using a
self-supervised learning framework using a real-world dataset consisting of
$37$ k scans, and then fine-tuned and evaluated the model using a smaller
labeled subset. Our empirical findings establish the predictive ability of the
considered modalities in detecting lasting effects in the retina associated
with acute stroke and forecasting future risk within a specific time horizon.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
framework by achieving $5$\% AUROC improvement as compared to the unimodal
image-only baseline, and $8$\% improvement compared to an existing
state-of-the-art foundation model. In conclusion, our study highlights the
potential of retinal imaging in identifying high-risk patients and improving

Abstract: Identifying and counting blood components such as red blood cells, various
types of white blood cells, and platelets is a critical task for healthcare
practitioners. Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) using supervised learning strategies, have shown considerable
success for such tasks. However, CNN based architectures such as U-Net, often
struggles to accurately identify platelets due to their sizes and high
variability of features. To address these challenges, researchers have commonly
employed strategies such as class weighted loss functions, which have
demonstrated some success. However, this does not address the more significant
challenge of platelet variability in size and tendency to form aggregates and
associations with other blood components. In this study, we explored an
alternative approach by investigating the role of convolutional kernels in
mitigating these issues. We also assigned separate classes to singular
platelets and platelet aggregates and performed semantic segmentation using
various U-Net architectures for identifying platelets. We then evaluated and
compared two common methods (pixel area method and connected component
analysis) for counting platelets and proposed an alternative approach
specialized for single platelets and platelet aggregates. Our experiments
provided results that showed significant improvements in the identification of
platelets, highlighting the importance of optimizing convolutional operations
and class designations. We show that the common practice of pixel area-based
counting often over estimate platelet counts, whereas the proposed method
presented in this work offers significant improvements. We discuss in detail
about these methods from segmentation masks.

*Zhe Zhang,Mingxiu Cai,Hanxiao Wang,Gaochang Wu,Tianyou Chai,Xiatian Zhu*

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为CostFilter-AD的新方法，通过引入成本过滤概念改进无监督异常检测的匹配过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督异常检测方法依赖图像或特征级匹配，但匹配过程不准确且被忽视，导致检测效果不佳。

Method: 构建匹配成本体积，并通过成本体积过滤网络进行细化，抑制噪声并保留边缘结构和细微异常。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA基准测试中验证了CostFilter-AD对单类和多类任务的通用性。

Conclusion: CostFilter-AD作为一种通用后处理插件，可显著提升现有方法的检测效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an
input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal
counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding
space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level
or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching
process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To
address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from
classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD
problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first
construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples,
comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes
potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network,
guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature
layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge
structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic
post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either
reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on
MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for
both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at
https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.

Conclusion: 为无需热传感器的轻量、低成本UAV野火监测系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: High-fidelity wildfire monitoring using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
typically requires multimodal sensing - especially RGB and thermal imagery -
which increases hardware cost and power consumption. This paper introduces
SAM-TIFF, a novel teacher-student distillation framework for pixel-level
wildfire temperature prediction and segmentation using RGB input only. A
multimodal teacher network trained on paired RGB-Thermal imagery and
radiometric TIFF ground truth distills knowledge to a unimodal RGB student
network, enabling thermal-sensor-free inference. Segmentation supervision is
generated using a hybrid approach of segment anything (SAM)-guided mask
generation, and selection via TOPSIS, along with Canny edge detection and
Otsu's thresholding pipeline for automatic point prompt selection. Our method
is the first to perform per-pixel temperature regression from RGB UAV data,
demonstrating strong generalization on the recent FLAME 3 dataset. This work
lays the foundation for lightweight, cost-effective UAV-based wildfire
monitoring systems without thermal sensors.

Result: 在三个数据集上验证，Dice得分为84.07%，跨病灶分割任务性能提升9.51%。

Conclusion: 该模型为胰腺疾病管理提供了高效技术支持，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer, characterized by its notable prevalence and mortality
rates, demands accurate lesion delineation for effective diagnosis and
therapeutic interventions. The generalizability of extant methods is frequently
compromised due to the pronounced variability in imaging and the heterogeneous
characteristics of pancreatic lesions, which may mimic normal tissues and
exhibit significant inter-patient variability. Thus, we propose a
generalization framework that synergizes pixel-level classification and
regression tasks, to accurately delineate lesions and improve model stability.
This framework not only seeks to align segmentation contours with actual
lesions but also uses regression to elucidate spatial relationships between
diseased and normal tissues, thereby improving tumor localization and
morphological characterization. Enhanced by the reciprocal transformation of
task outputs, our approach integrates additional regression supervision within
the segmentation context, bolstering the model's generalization ability from a
dual-task perspective. Besides, dual self-supervised learning in feature spaces
and output spaces augments the model's representational capability and
stability across different imaging views. Experiments on 594 samples composed
of three datasets with significant imaging differences demonstrate that our
generalized pancreas segmentation results comparable to mainstream in-domain
validation performance (Dice: 84.07%). More importantly, it successfully
improves the results of the highly challenging cross-lesion generalized
pancreatic cancer segmentation task by 9.51%. Thus, our model constitutes a
resilient and efficient foundational technological support for pancreatic
disease management and wider medical applications. The codes will be released
at https://github.com/SJTUBME-QianLab/Dual-Task-Seg.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to fMRI-based visual image
reconstruction using a subject-agnostic common representation space. We show
that the brain signals of the subjects can be aligned in this common space
during training to form a semantically aligned common brain. This is leveraged
to demonstrate that aligning subject-specific lightweight modules to a
reference subject is significantly more efficient than traditional end-to-end
training methods. Our approach excels in low-data scenarios. We evaluate our
methods on different datasets, demonstrating that the common space is subject
and dataset-agnostic.

Abstract: Curriculum learning strategies have been proven to be effective in various
applications and have gained significant interest in the field of machine
learning. It has the ability to improve the final model's performance and
accelerate the training process. However, in the medical imaging domain, data
irregularities can make the recognition task more challenging and usually
result in misclassification between the different classes in the dataset.
Class-decomposition approaches have shown promising results in solving such a
problem by learning the boundaries within the classes of the data set. In this
paper, we present a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) training method
based on the curriculum learning strategy and the class decomposition approach,
which we call CLOG-CD, to improve the performance of medical image
classification. We evaluated our method on four different imbalanced medical
image datasets, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), brain tumour, digital knee X-ray,
and histopathology colorectal cancer (CRC). CLOG-CD utilises the learnt weights
from the decomposition granularity of the classes, and the training is
accomplished from descending to ascending order (i.e., anti-curriculum
technique). We also investigated the classification performance of our proposed
method based on different acceleration factors and pace function curricula. We
used two pre-trained networks, ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121, as the backbone for
CLOG-CD. The results with ResNet-50 show that CLOG-CD has the ability to
improve classification performance with an accuracy of 96.08% for the CXR
dataset, 96.91% for the brain tumour dataset, 79.76% for the digital knee
X-ray, and 99.17% for the CRC dataset, compared to other training strategies.
In addition, with DenseNet-121, CLOG-CD has achieved 94.86%, 94.63%, 76.19%,
and 99.45% for CXR, brain tumour, digital knee X-ray, and CRC datasets,
respectively

TLDR: LensNet是一种端到端深度学习框架，通过动态估计点扩散函数（PSF）和嵌入维纳滤波，显著提升了无透镜成像的质量和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无透镜成像技术依赖静态或近似PSF模型，适应性差且需要繁琐的预处理，限制了高保真重建。

Method: 提出LensNet框架，结合空间域和频域表示，使用可学习的编码掩模模拟器（CMS）动态估计PSF，并嵌入维纳滤波优化重建。

Result: 实验表明，LensNet在保留高频细节和降噪方面优于现有方法，重建质量更高。

Conclusion: LensNet为无透镜成像提供了一种更准确、灵活且实用的解决方案，适用于微型传感器和医疗诊断等领域。

Abstract: Lensless imaging stands out as a promising alternative to conventional
lens-based systems, particularly in scenarios demanding ultracompact form
factors and cost-effective architectures. However, such systems are
fundamentally governed by the Point Spread Function (PSF), which dictates how a
point source contributes to the final captured signal. Traditional lensless
techniques often require explicit calibrations and extensive pre-processing,
relying on static or approximate PSF models. These rigid strategies can result
in limited adaptability to real-world challenges, including noise, system
imperfections, and dynamic scene variations, thus impeding high-fidelity
reconstruction. In this paper, we propose LensNet, an end-to-end deep learning
framework that integrates spatial-domain and frequency-domain representations
in a unified pipeline. Central to our approach is a learnable Coded Mask
Simulator (CMS) that enables dynamic, data-driven estimation of the PSF during
training, effectively mitigating the shortcomings of fixed or sparsely
calibrated kernels. By embedding a Wiener filtering component, LensNet refines
global structure and restores fine-scale details, thus alleviating the
dependency on multiple handcrafted pre-processing steps. Extensive experiments
demonstrate LensNet's robust performance and superior reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving high-frequency
details and attenuating noise. The proposed framework establishes a novel
convergence between physics-based modeling and data-driven learning, paving the
way for more accurate, flexible, and practical lensless imaging solutions for
applications ranging from miniature sensors to medical diagnostics. The link of

Conclusion: LInFBP首次将深度学习应用于FBP的插值步骤，有效解决了插值误差问题，提升了CT图像重建质量。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) images is crucial in
medical imaging field. However, there are unavoidable interpolation errors in
the backprojection step of the conventional reconstruction methods, i.e.,
filtered-back-projection based methods, which are detrimental to the accurate
reconstruction. In this study, to address this issue, we propose a novel deep
learning model, named Leanable-Interpolation-based FBP or LInFBP shortly, to
enhance the reconstructed CT image quality, which achieves learnable
interpolation in the backprojection step of filtered backprojection (FBP) and
alleviates the interpolation errors. Specifically, in the proposed LInFBP, we
formulate every local piece of the latent continuous function of discrete
sinogram data as a linear combination of selected basis functions, and learn
this continuous function by exploiting a deep network to predict the linear
combination coefficients. Then, the learned latent continuous function is
exploited for interpolation in backprojection step, which first time takes the
advantage of deep learning for the interpolation in FBP. Extensive experiments,
which encompass diverse CT scenarios, demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed LInFBP in terms of enhanced reconstructed image quality, plug-and-play
ability and generalization capability.

Motivation: 眼底图像常因硬件限制和操作变异性而分辨率低、信噪比差，现有方法缺乏统一的多尺度增强框架，且未针对病变区域优化。

Conclusion: MTRL-FIE为眼底图像增强提供了统一的多尺度框架，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: High-quality fundus images provide essential anatomical information for
clinical screening and ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Yet, due to hardware
limitations, operational variability, and patient compliance, fundus images
often suffer from low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Recent years have
witnessed promising progress in fundus image enhancement. However, existing
works usually focus on restoring structural details or global characteristics
of fundus images, lacking a unified image enhancement framework to recover
comprehensive multi-scale information. Moreover, few methods pinpoint the
target of image enhancement, e.g., lesions, which is crucial for medical
image-based diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale
target-aware representation learning framework (MTRL-FIE) for efficient fundus
image enhancement. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale feature encoder (MFE)
that employs wavelet decomposition to embed both low-frequency structural
information and high-frequency details. Next, we design a structure-preserving
hierarchical decoder (SHD) to fuse multi-scale feature embeddings for real
fundus image restoration. SHD integrates hierarchical fusion and group
attention mechanisms to achieve adaptive feature fusion while retaining local
structural smoothness. Meanwhile, a target-aware feature aggregation (TFA)
module is used to enhance pathological regions and reduce artifacts.
Experimental results on multiple fundus image datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of MTRL-FIE for fundus image enhancement.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, MTRL-FIE achieves superior enhancement
performance with a more lightweight architecture. Furthermore, our approach
generalizes to other ophthalmic image processing tasks without supervised
fine-tuning, highlighting its potential for clinical applications.

Conclusion: SLM-SAM 2为医学图像自动标注提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Manual annotation of volumetric medical images, such as magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), is a labor-intensive and
time-consuming process. Recent advancements in foundation models for video
object segmentation, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), offer a
potential opportunity to significantly speed up the annotation process by
manually annotating one or a few slices and then propagating target masks
across the entire volume. However, the performance of SAM 2 in this context
varies. Our experiments show that relying on a single memory bank and attention
module is prone to error propagation, particularly at boundary regions where
the target is present in the previous slice but absent in the current one. To
address this problem, we propose Short-Long Memory SAM 2 (SLM-SAM 2), a novel
architecture that integrates distinct short-term and long-term memory banks
with separate attention modules to improve segmentation accuracy. We evaluate
SLM-SAM 2 on three public datasets covering organs, bones, and muscles across
MRI and CT modalities. We show that the proposed method markedly outperforms
the default SAM 2, achieving average Dice Similarity Coefficient improvement of
0.14 and 0.11 in the scenarios when 5 volumes and 1 volume are available for
the initial adaptation, respectively. SLM-SAM 2 also exhibits stronger
resistance to over-propagation, making a notable step toward more accurate
automated annotation of medical images for segmentation model development.

Abstract: Inland water body segmentation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is
an important task needed for several applications, such as flood mapping. While
SAR sensors capture data in all-weather conditions as high-resolution images,
differentiating water and water-like surfaces from SAR images is not
straightforward. Inland water bodies, such as large river basins, have complex
geometry, which adds to the challenge of segmentation. U-Net is a widely used
deep learning model for land-water segmentation of SAR images. In practice,
manual annotation is often used to generate the corresponding water masks as
ground truth. Manual annotation of the images is prone to label noise owing to
data poisoning attacks, especially due to complex geometry. In this work, we
simulate manual errors in the form of adversarial attacks on the U-Net model
and study the robustness of the model to human errors in annotation. Our
results indicate that U-Net can tolerate a certain level of corruption before
its performance drops significantly. This finding highlights the crucial role
that the quality of manual annotations plays in determining the effectiveness
of the segmentation model. The code and the new dataset, along with adversarial
examples for robust training, are publicly available. (Github link -

Conclusion: HIRQM在噪声、模糊和压缩伪影处理上表现优异，适用于图像压缩和恢复等应用。

Abstract: Traditional image quality assessment metrics like Mean Squared Error and
Structural Similarity Index often fail to reflect perceptual quality under
complex distortions. We propose the Hybrid Image Resolution Quality Metric
(HIRQM), integrating statistical, multi-scale, and deep learning-based methods
for a comprehensive quality evaluation. HIRQM combines three components:
Probability Density Function for local pixel distribution analysis, Multi-scale
Feature Similarity for structural integrity across resolutions, and
Hierarchical Deep Image Features using a pre-trained VGG16 network for semantic
alignment with human perception. A dynamic weighting mechanism adapts component
contributions based on image characteristics like brightness and variance,
enhancing flexibility across distortion types. Our contributions include a
unified metric and dynamic weighting for better perceptual alignment. Evaluated
on TID2013 and LIVE datasets, HIRQM achieves Pearson and Spearman correlations
of 0.92 and 0.90, outperforming traditional metrics. It excels in handling
noise, blur, and compression artifacts, making it valuable for image processing
applications like compression and restoration.

Abstract: Heterogeneous morphological features and data imbalance pose significant
challenges in rare thyroid carcinoma classification using ultrasound imaging.
To address this issue, we propose a novel multitask learning framework,
Channel-Spatial Attention Synergy Network (CSASN), which integrates a
dual-branch feature extractor - combining EfficientNet for local spatial
encoding and ViT for global semantic modeling, with a cascaded channel-spatial
attention refinement module. A residual multiscale classifier and dynamically
weighted loss function further enhance classification stability and accuracy.
Trained on a multicenter dataset comprising more than 2000 patients from four
clinical institutions, our framework leverages a residual multiscale classifier
and dynamically weighted loss function to enhance classification stability and
accuracy. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that each module contributes
significantly to model performance, particularly in recognizing rare subtypes
such as FTC and MTC carcinomas. Experimental results show that CSASN
outperforms existing single-stream CNN or Transformer-based models, achieving a
superior balance between precision and recall under class-imbalanced
conditions. This framework provides a promising strategy for AI-assisted
thyroid cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: The segmentation of cranial nerves (CNs) tract provides a valuable
quantitative tool for the analysis of the morphology and trajectory of
individual CNs. Multimodal CNs tract segmentation networks, e.g., CNTSeg, which
combine structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and diffusion MRI, have
achieved promising segmentation performance. However, it is laborious or even
infeasible to collect complete multimodal data in clinical practice due to
limitations in equipment, user privacy, and working conditions. In this work,
we propose a novel arbitrary-modal fusion network for volumetric CNs tract
segmentation, called CNTSeg-v2, which trains one model to handle different
combinations of available modalities. Instead of directly combining all the
modalities, we select T1-weighted (T1w) images as the primary modality due to
its simplicity in data acquisition and contribution most to the results, which
supervises the information selection of other auxiliary modalities. Our model
encompasses an Arbitrary-Modal Collaboration Module (ACM) designed to
effectively extract informative features from other auxiliary modalities,
guided by the supervision of T1w images. Meanwhile, we construct a Deep
Distance-guided Multi-stage (DDM) decoder to correct small errors and
discontinuities through signed distance maps to improve segmentation accuracy.
We evaluate our CNTSeg-v2 on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset and the
clinical Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset. Extensive experimental
results show that our CNTSeg-v2 achieves state-of-the-art segmentation
performance, outperforming all competing methods.

be hampered by uncertainty. This uncertainty starts to arise due to some
factors like atypical presentations, limitations of diagnostic tools such as
chest X-rays, and the presence of co-existing respiratory conditions. This
research proposes one of the supervised learning methods, CNN. Using
MobileNetV2 as the pre-trained one with ResNet101V2 architecture and using
Keras API as the built from scratch model, for identifying lung diseases
especially pneumonia. The datasets used in this research were obtained from the
website through Kaggle. The result shows that by implementing CNN MobileNetV2
and CNN from scratch the result is promising. While validating data,
MobileNetV2 performs with stability and minimal overfitting, while the training
accuracy increased to 84.87% later it slightly decreased to 78.95%, with
increasing validation loss from 0.499 to 0.6345. Nonetheless, MobileNetV2 is
more stable. Although it takes more time to train each epoch. Meanwhile, after
the 10th epoch, the Scratch model displayed more instability and overfitting
despite having higher validation accuracy, training accuracy decreased
significantly to 78.12% and the validation loss increased from 0.5698 to
1.1809. With these results, ResNet101V2 offers stability, and the Scratch model
offers high accuracy.

*Yiqun Lin,Hualiang Wang,Jixiang Chen,Jiewen Yang,Jiarong Guo,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: DeepSparse是一种用于稀疏视图CBCT重建的基础模型，结合了DiCE网络和HyViP框架，显著提升了图像质量并降低了辐射需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT的高辐射暴露对患者有潜在风险，现有稀疏视图重建方法存在计算量大和泛化性差的问题。

Method: 提出DeepSparse模型，包含DiCE网络（整合2D和3D特征）和HyViP框架（混合视图采样预训练），采用两步微调策略。

Result: 实验表明DeepSparse在重建质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeepSparse为更安全高效的CBCT成像提供了新途径。

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a critical 3D imaging technology in
the medical field, while the high radiation exposure required for high-quality
imaging raises significant concerns, particularly for vulnerable populations.
Sparse-view reconstruction reduces radiation by using fewer X-ray projections
while maintaining image quality, yet existing methods face challenges such as
high computational demands and poor generalizability to different datasets. To
overcome these limitations, we propose DeepSparse, the first foundation model
for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction, featuring DiCE (Dual-Dimensional
Cross-Scale Embedding), a novel network that integrates multi-view 2D features
and multi-scale 3D features. Additionally, we introduce the HyViP (Hybrid View
Sampling Pretraining) framework, which pretrains the model on large datasets
with both sparse-view and dense-view projections, and a two-step finetuning
strategy to adapt and refine the model for new datasets. Extensive experiments
and ablation studies demonstrate that our proposed DeepSparse achieves superior
reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, paving the way for
safer and more efficient CBCT imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: 提出了一种结合多视角特征集成和高效序列建模的图像去噪模型，显著提升了去噪效果并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以区分真实场景中的复杂噪声模式，且基于Transformer的模型计算资源消耗大。

Method: 提出Context-guided Receptance Weighted Key-Value模型，结合CTS范式、FMix模块和BiWKV机制，实现高效噪声建模。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上定量优于现有方法，推理时间减少40%，并能恢复精细细节。

Conclusion: 该模型在去噪效果和计算效率上均表现出色，适用于真实场景应用。

Abstract: Image denoising is essential in low-level vision applications such as
photography and automated driving. Existing methods struggle with
distinguishing complex noise patterns in real-world scenes and consume
significant computational resources due to reliance on Transformer-based
models. In this work, the Context-guided Receptance Weighted Key-Value (\M)
model is proposed, combining enhanced multi-view feature integration with
efficient sequence modeling. Our approach introduces the Context-guided Token
Shift (CTS) paradigm, which effectively captures local spatial dependencies and
enhance the model's ability to model real-world noise distributions.
Additionally, the Frequency Mix (FMix) module extracting frequency-domain
features is designed to isolate noise in high-frequency spectra, and is
integrated with spatial representations through a multi-view learning process.
To improve computational efficiency, the Bidirectional WKV (BiWKV) mechanism is
adopted, enabling full pixel-sequence interaction with linear complexity while
overcoming the causal selection constraints. The model is validated on multiple
real-world image denoising datasets, outperforming the existing
state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and reducing inference time up to 40\%.
Qualitative results further demonstrate the ability of our model to restore
fine details in various scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前预测模型在数据稀缺和新表位情况下泛化能力不足，限制了免疫治疗和疫苗开发。

Method: 使用ESM-1b编码TCR序列，MolFormer处理肽的SMILES字符串，结合生物和化学特征。

Result: 在零样本和少样本学习中优于现有模型（如ChemBERTa、TITAN、NetTCR），并通过嵌入分析显示聚类改进。

Conclusion: LANTERN有望推动TCR-pMHC结合预测，支持个性化免疫治疗的发展。

Abstract: Understanding the binding specificity between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and
peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) is central to immunotherapy
and vaccine development. However, current predictive models struggle with
generalization, especially in data-scarce settings and when faced with novel
epitopes. We present LANTERN (Large lAnguage model-powered TCR-Enhanced
Recognition Network), a deep learning framework that combines large-scale
protein language models with chemical representations of peptides. By encoding
TCR \b{eta}-chain sequences using ESM-1b and transforming peptide sequences
into SMILES strings processed by MolFormer, LANTERN captures rich biological
and chemical features critical for TCR-peptide recognition. Through extensive
benchmarking against existing models such as ChemBERTa, TITAN, and NetTCR,
LANTERN demonstrates superior performance, particularly in zero-shot and
few-shot learning scenarios. Our model also benefits from a robust negative
sampling strategy and shows significant clustering improvements via embedding
analysis. These results highlight the potential of LANTERN to advance TCR-pMHC
binding prediction and support the development of personalized immunotherapies.

TLDR: CHORUS框架通过检索增强生成技术，显著提升了开源LLMs在生成Gurobi线性规划代码上的性能，甚至超越GPT3.5和GPT4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性规划问题对非专家用户具有挑战性，需要结合领域知识、数学技能和编程能力。研究探索LLMs在生成求解器特定代码上的效率。

Method: 提出CHORUS框架，采用分层树状分块策略和两阶段检索方法，结合专家设计的提示和结构化解析器。

Result: 在NL4Opt-Code基准测试中，CHORUS显著提升开源LLMs性能，超越基线及传统RAG，甚至优于GPT3.5和GPT4。

Conclusion: CHORUS证明了专家提示、分层分块和结构化推理的重要性，为LLMs在代码生成任务中的应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Linear Programming (LP) problems aim to find the optimal solution to an
objective under constraints. These problems typically require domain knowledge,
mathematical skills, and programming ability, presenting significant challenges
for non-experts. This study explores the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in generating solver-specific LP code. We propose CHORUS, a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for synthesizing Gurobi-based LP
code from natural language problem statements. CHORUS incorporates a
hierarchical tree-like chunking strategy for theoretical contents and generates
additional metadata based on code examples from documentation to facilitate
self-contained, semantically coherent retrieval. Two-stage retrieval approach
of CHORUS followed by cross-encoder reranking further ensures contextual
relevance. Finally, expertly crafted prompt and structured parser with
reasoning steps improve code generation performance significantly. Experiments
on the NL4Opt-Code benchmark show that CHORUS improves the performance of
open-source LLMs such as Llama3.1 (8B), Llama3.3 (70B), Phi4 (14B), Deepseek-r1
(32B), and Qwen2.5-coder (32B) by a significant margin compared to baseline and
conventional RAG. It also allows these open-source LLMs to outperform or match
the performance of much stronger baselines-GPT3.5 and GPT4 while requiring far
fewer computational resources. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
importance of expert prompting, hierarchical chunking, and structured
reasoning.

*Amit Rath*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: STROT框架通过结构化提示和反馈驱动的转换逻辑，提升LLM在结构化数据分析中的可靠性和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在结构化数据分析中存在模式解释不一致、用户意图与模型输出不对齐及缺乏自我纠正机制的问题。

Method: STROT框架结合轻量级模式内省、样本字段分类和动态上下文构建，通过结构化提示和迭代修正机制优化输出。

Result: STROT显著提升了LLM在结构化数据任务中的解释性、稳定性和正确性。

Conclusion: STROT为LLM在结构化数据分析中提供了可重复且鲁棒的推理框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding and task generalization. However, their
application to structured data analysis remains fragile due to inconsistencies
in schema interpretation, misalignment between user intent and model output,
and limited mechanisms for self-correction when failures occur. This paper
introduces the STROT Framework (Structured Task Reasoning and Output
Transformation), a method for structured prompting and feedback-driven
transformation logic generation aimed at improving the reliability and semantic
alignment of LLM-based analytical workflows. STROT begins with lightweight
schema introspection and sample-based field classification, enabling dynamic
context construction that captures both the structure and statistical profile
of the input data. This contextual information is embedded in structured
prompts that guide the model toward generating task-specific, interpretable
outputs. To address common failure modes in complex queries, STROT incorporates
a refinement mechanism in which the model iteratively revises its outputs based
on execution feedback and validation signals. Unlike conventional approaches
that rely on static prompts or single-shot inference, STROT treats the LLM as a
reasoning agent embedded within a controlled analysis loop -- capable of
adjusting its output trajectory through planning and correction. The result is
a robust and reproducible framework for reasoning over structured data with
LLMs, applicable to diverse data exploration and analysis tasks where
interpretability, stability, and correctness are essential.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 本文探讨了Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO)及其改进版2D-DPO在LLM对齐人类偏好中的表现，并提出了一种增强2D-DPO对噪声鲁棒性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO虽高效但缺乏细粒度评分，而人类偏好对响应不同部分的评价并不一致，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出2D-DPO方法，并进一步引入段级评分噪声鲁棒性机制。

Result: 2D-DPO优于标准DPO，但对噪声敏感；改进后的算法在理论和实验上均验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 2D-DPO及其噪声鲁棒性改进为LLM对齐提供了更优方案，但仍需探索其他噪声模型。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) has emerged as a powerful method for
aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, offering a stable
and efficient alternative to approaches that use Reinforcement learning via
Human Feedback. In this work, we investigate the performance of DPO using
open-source preference datasets. One of the major drawbacks of DPO is that it
doesn't induce granular scoring and treats all the segments of the responses
with equal propensity. However, this is not practically true for human
preferences since even "good" responses have segments that may not be preferred
by the annotator. To resolve this, a 2-dimensional scoring for DPO alignment
called 2D-DPO was proposed. We explore the 2D-DPO alignment paradigm and the
advantages it provides over the standard DPO by comparing their win rates. It
is observed that these methods, even though effective, are not robust to
label/score noise. To counter this, we propose an approach of incorporating
segment-level score noise robustness to the 2D-DPO algorithm. Along with
theoretical backing, we also provide empirical verification in favour of the
algorithm and introduce other noise models that can be present.

Abstract: Biased news reporting poses a significant threat to informed decision-making
and the functioning of democracies. This study introduces a novel methodology
for scalable, minimally biased analysis of media bias in political news. The
proposed approach examines event selection, labeling, word choice, and
commission and omission biases across news sources by leveraging natural
language processing techniques, including hierarchical topic modeling,
sentiment analysis, and ontology learning with large language models. Through
three case studies related to current political events, we demonstrate the
methodology's effectiveness in identifying biases across news sources at
various levels of granularity. This work represents a significant step towards
scalable, minimally biased media bias analysis, laying the groundwork for tools
to help news consumers navigate an increasingly complex media landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs如何通过注意力机制处理图结构数据，以改进其建模能力。

Method: 从注意力机制角度进行实证研究，分析LLMs在图结构数据上的行为。

Result: 1) LLMs能识别图数据但难以建模节点关系；2) 注意力分布与结构模式不匹配；3) 中间态注意力窗口优于全连接或固定连接。

Conclusion: LLMs的注意力机制在图结构数据上存在不足，中间态注意力窗口是一种有效改进方案。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are critical to the success of large language models
(LLMs), driving significant advancements in multiple fields. However, for
graph-structured data, which requires emphasis on topological connections, they
fall short compared to message-passing mechanisms on fixed links, such as those
employed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This raises a question: ``Does
attention fail for graphs in natural language settings?'' Motivated by these
observations, we embarked on an empirical study from the perspective of
attention mechanisms to explore how LLMs process graph-structured data. The
goal is to gain deeper insights into the attention behavior of LLMs over graph
structures. We uncovered unique phenomena regarding how LLMs apply attention to
graph-structured data and analyzed these findings to improve the modeling of
such data by LLMs. The primary findings of our research are: 1) While LLMs can
recognize graph data and capture text-node interactions, they struggle to model
inter-node relationships within graph structures due to inherent architectural
constraints. 2) The attention distribution of LLMs across graph nodes does not
align with ideal structural patterns, indicating a failure to adapt to graph
topology nuances. 3) Neither fully connected attention nor fixed connectivity
is optimal; each has specific limitations in its application scenarios.
Instead, intermediate-state attention windows improve LLM training performance
and seamlessly transition to fully connected windows during inference. Source

Motivation: 公共数据即将耗尽，而分散的私有数据因隐私和激励问题未被充分利用。

Result: 理论分析验证了iPFL的激励性质，实证研究显示其在经济效用和模型性能上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: iPFL有望成为未来利用分散私有数据训练AI模型的关键技术。

Abstract: While data plays a crucial role in training contemporary AI models, it is
acknowledged that valuable public data will be exhausted in a few years,
directing the world's attention towards the massive decentralized private data.
However, the privacy-sensitive nature of raw data and lack of incentive
mechanism prevent these valuable data from being fully exploited. Addressing
these challenges, this paper proposes inclusive and incentivized personalized
federated learning (iPFL), which incentivizes data holders with diverse
purposes to collaboratively train personalized models without revealing raw
data. iPFL constructs a model-sharing market by solving a graph-based training
optimization and incorporates an incentive mechanism based on game theory
principles. Theoretical analysis shows that iPFL adheres to two key incentive
properties: individual rationality and truthfulness. Empirical studies on
eleven AI tasks (e.g., large language models' instruction-following tasks)
demonstrate that iPFL consistently achieves the highest economic utility, and
better or comparable model performance compared to baseline methods. We
anticipate that our iPFL can serve as a valuable technique for boosting future
AI models on decentralized private data while making everyone satisfied.

Motivation: 目标是开发一种能够无缝融入日常生活的语音AI代理，实现自主、实时且情感丰富的交互，超越传统的命令反应模式。

Method: Voila采用端到端架构，结合分层多尺度Transformer，集成大型语言模型的推理能力和强大的声学建模，支持低延迟（195毫秒）和丰富的语音生成。

Result: Voila实现了195毫秒的响应延迟，超过人类平均响应时间，支持超过100万种预建声音，并能通过简短音频样本高效定制新声音。

Conclusion: Voila作为开源模型，为下一代人机交互提供了统一框架，支持多种语音应用，并推动了开放研究的进展。

Abstract: A voice AI agent that blends seamlessly into daily life would interact with
humans in an autonomous, real-time, and emotionally expressive manner. Rather
than merely reacting to commands, it would continuously listen, reason, and
respond proactively, fostering fluid, dynamic, and emotionally resonant
interactions. We introduce Voila, a family of large voice-language foundation
models that make a step towards this vision. Voila moves beyond traditional
pipeline systems by adopting a new end-to-end architecture that enables
full-duplex, low-latency conversations while preserving rich vocal nuances such
as tone, rhythm, and emotion. It achieves a response latency of just 195
milliseconds, surpassing the average human response time. Its hierarchical
multi-scale Transformer integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) with powerful acoustic modeling, enabling natural, persona-aware
voice generation -- where users can simply write text instructions to define
the speaker's identity, tone, and other characteristics. Moreover, Voila
supports over one million pre-built voices and efficient customization of new
ones from brief audio samples as short as 10 seconds. Beyond spoken dialogue,
Voila is designed as a unified model for a wide range of voice-based
applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech
(TTS), and, with minimal adaptation, multilingual speech translation. Voila is
fully open-sourced to support open research and accelerate progress toward
next-generation human-machine interactions.

Result: 实验表明SIM-RAG在多轮RAG任务中表现优异，且系统高效、数据高效。

Conclusion: SIM-RAG为多轮RAG提供了一种高效且无需人工标注的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown strong capability in enhancing
language models' knowledge and reducing AI generative hallucinations, driving
its widespread use. However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval
remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a
good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue
searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may
provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge.
Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled
process supervision data or lead to subpar performance.
  This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework,
\textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and
multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system
self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs
with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic
training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths,
which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and
unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information
sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG
system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval
decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context
reinforcement learning.
  Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an
effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is
system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring
modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient,
eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process
supervision data.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: AutoLibra是一个框架，通过将开放式人类反馈转化为具体的行为评估指标，优化和评估语言代理的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理评估方法依赖粗粒度的任务成功指标，缺乏对中间行为的奖励，且需要专家手动设计。

Method: AutoLibra将人类反馈与代理行为关联，聚类相似的正负行为，生成具体指标，并利用LLM作为评估者。

Result: 实验表明，AutoLibra能生成更具体的评估指标，并在文本游戏和网页导航任务中提升代理性能20%。

Conclusion: AutoLibra是一种强大的任务无关工具，可用于评估和改进语言代理。

Abstract: Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics,
which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward
intermediate emergent behaviors. We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent
evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback, e.g., "If you find that
the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much
autonomy to decide what to do on its own", into metrics for evaluating
fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by
grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and
negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and
concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as
evaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a
set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy".
Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate
AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the
ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics
to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent
improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better
prompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text
game tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%. Second,
we show that AutoLibra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for
web navigation agents. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful
task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种双向Text×Pressure模型（TxP），利用生成基础模型将压力数据与自然语言相互转换，提升了基于压力传感器的人类活动识别（HAR）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HAR研究多关注惯性测量单元和视觉数据，忽视了压力传感器的潜力。由于数据集有限，压力传感器在HAR领域未得到充分利用。

Method: 提出TxP模型，包含Text2Pressure和Pressure2Text两个任务，利用CLIP和LLaMA 2 13B Chat等预训练模型，在合成的PressLang数据集（81,100对文本-压力数据）上进行训练。

Result: 在真实数据（如瑜伽和日常任务）上验证，TxP将HAR性能提升了12.4%（宏F1分数）。

Conclusion: TxP为压力传感器在HAR中的应用提供了新方法，扩展了数据增强和分类的可能性，并深入揭示了人体运动的动态特征。

Abstract: Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has predominantly focused on
Inertial Measurement Units and vision data, often overlooking the capabilities
unique to pressure sensors, which capture subtle body dynamics and shifts in
the center of mass. Despite their potential for postural and balance-based
activities, pressure sensors remain underutilized in the HAR domain due to
limited datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose to exploit generative
foundation models with pressure-specific HAR techniques. Specifically, we
present a bidirectional Text$\times$Pressure model that uses generative
foundation models to interpret pressure data as natural language. TxP
accomplishes two tasks: (1) Text2Pressure, converting activity text
descriptions into pressure sequences, and (2) Pressure2Text, generating
activity descriptions and classifications from dynamic pressure maps.
Leveraging pre-trained models like CLIP and LLaMA 2 13B Chat, TxP is trained on
our synthetic PressLang dataset, containing over 81,100 text-pressure pairs.
Validated on real-world data for activities such as yoga and daily tasks, TxP
provides novel approaches to data augmentation and classification grounded in
atomic actions. This consequently improved HAR performance by up to 12.4\% in
macro F1 score compared to the state-of-the-art, advancing pressure-based HAR
with broader applications and deeper insights into human movement.

Abstract: Operating robots in open-ended scenarios with diverse tasks is a crucial
research and application direction in robotics. While recent progress in
natural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots'
ability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the
procedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open
environments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive
capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge,
a hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It
consists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale
pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation
(IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA).
RoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural
skill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition
and execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over
existing baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83%
average success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world
data samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards
integrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems,
offering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation.

Motivation: 解决场景中物体间空间关系的理解问题，特别是未见物体的空间分布预测。

Method: 提出了两种相关信息模型（CECI）：基于图卷积网络的基线方法和结合LLM空间知识的神经符号扩展方法。

Result: 在模拟数据和真实室内环境中验证了框架的有效性，能够跨不同房间类型解释场景。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了基于常识的场景构图，为场景理解提供了新方法。

Abstract: This work establishes the concept of commonsense scene composition, with a
focus on extending Belief Scene Graphs by estimating the spatial distribution
of unseen objects. Specifically, the commonsense scene composition capability
refers to the understanding of the spatial relationships among related objects
in the scene, which in this article is modeled as a joint probability
distribution for all possible locations of the semantic object class. The
proposed framework includes two variants of a Correlation Information (CECI)
model for learning probability distributions: (i) a baseline approach based on
a Graph Convolutional Network, and (ii) a neuro-symbolic extension that
integrates a spatial ontology based on Large Language Models (LLMs).
Furthermore, this article provides a detailed description of the dataset
generation process for such tasks. Finally, the framework has been validated
through multiple runs on simulated data, as well as in a real-world indoor
environment, demonstrating its ability to spatially interpret scenes across
different room types.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为点云重组的方法，通过在受控实验室环境中测量物理目标对象的点云，系统性地增强真实点云场景，以生成大量可重复、物理准确的测试场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR感知在开放世界应用中的验证仍具挑战性，虚拟仿真缺乏物理传感器特性，而真实数据则难以控制影响因素。现有方法通过场景间对象转移增强真实点云数据，但未考虑验证且可控性有限。

Method: 提出点云重组方法，将实验室环境中测量的物理目标对象点云集成到真实场景中，生成可重复且物理准确的测试场景，支持现象感知遮挡和注册3D网格。

Result: 使用Ouster OS1-128 Rev7传感器，成功将人形目标（不同服装和姿态）融入真实城市场景，重组场景与真实传感器输出高度匹配，支持针对性测试和可扩展的故障分析。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了受控且传感器真实的数据，能够可靠地评估特定传感器与算法（如目标检测）的局限性，提升系统安全性。

Abstract: The validation of LiDAR-based perception of intelligent mobile systems
operating in open-world applications remains a challenge due to the variability
of real environmental conditions. Virtual simulations allow the generation of
arbitrary scenes under controlled conditions but lack physical sensor
characteristics, such as intensity responses or material-dependent effects. In
contrast, real-world data offers true sensor realism but provides less control
over influencing factors, hindering sufficient validation. Existing approaches
address this problem with augmentation of real-world point cloud data by
transferring objects between scenes. However, these methods do not consider
validation and remain limited in controllability because they rely on empirical
data. We solve these limitations by proposing Point Cloud Recombination, which
systematically augments captured point cloud scenes by integrating point clouds
acquired from physical target objects measured in controlled laboratory
environments. Thus enabling the creation of vast amounts and varieties of
repeatable, physically accurate test scenes with respect to phenomena-aware
occlusions with registered 3D meshes. Using the Ouster OS1-128 Rev7 sensor, we
demonstrate the augmentation of real-world urban and rural scenes with humanoid
targets featuring varied clothing and poses, for repeatable positioning. We
show that the recombined scenes closely match real sensor outputs, enabling
targeted testing, scalable failure analysis, and improved system safety. By
providing controlled yet sensor-realistic data, our method enables trustworthy
conclusions about the limitations of specific sensors in compound with their
algorithms, e.g., object detection.

TLDR: GtG 2.0是一种轻量级但高效的机器人抓取框架，利用图神经网络从点云数据中进行几何推理，显著提升了抓取检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在杂乱真实环境中因噪声和不完整感知数据以及复杂物体几何形状导致的抓取姿态检测难题。

Method: 采用假设-测试框架，结合图神经网络和7自由度抓取候选生成器，改进点云表示（内部和外部点）。

Result: 在GraspNet-1Billion基准测试中平均精度提升35%，实验成功率达91%，杂乱完成率100%。

Conclusion: GtG 2.0在抓取检测中表现出色，灵活可靠，成为当前最佳框架之一。

Abstract: Grasp pose detection in cluttered, real-world environments remains a
significant challenge due to noisy and incomplete sensory data combined with
complex object geometries. This paper introduces Grasp the Graph 2.0 (GtG 2.0)
method, a lightweight yet highly effective hypothesis-and-test robotics
grasping framework which leverages an ensemble of Graph Neural Networks for
efficient geometric reasoning from point cloud data. Building on the success of
GtG 1.0, which demonstrated the potential of Graph Neural Networks for grasp
detection but was limited by assumptions of complete, noise-free point clouds
and 4-Dof grasping, GtG 2.0 employs a conventional Grasp Pose Generator to
efficiently produce 7-Dof grasp candidates. Candidates are assessed with an
ensemble Graph Neural Network model which includes points within the gripper
jaws (inside points) and surrounding contextual points (outside points). This
improved representation boosts grasp detection performance over previous
methods using the same generator. GtG 2.0 shows up to a 35% improvement in
Average Precision on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark compared to
hypothesis-and-test and Graph Neural Network-based methods, ranking it among
the top three frameworks. Experiments with a 3-Dof Delta Parallel robot and
Kinect-v1 camera show a success rate of 91% and a clutter completion rate of
100%, demonstrating its flexibility and reliability.

Abstract: Teleoperating humanoid robots in a whole-body manner marks a fundamental step
toward developing general-purpose robotic intelligence, with human motion
providing an ideal interface for controlling all degrees of freedom. Yet, most
current humanoid teleoperation systems fall short of enabling coordinated
whole-body behavior, typically limiting themselves to isolated locomotion or
manipulation tasks. We present the Teleoperated Whole-Body Imitation System
(TWIST), a system for humanoid teleoperation through whole-body motion
imitation. We first generate reference motion clips by retargeting human motion
capture data to the humanoid robot. We then develop a robust, adaptive, and
responsive whole-body controller using a combination of reinforcement learning
and behavior cloning (RL+BC). Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how
incorporating privileged future motion frames and real-world motion capture
(MoCap) data improves tracking accuracy. TWIST enables real-world humanoid
robots to achieve unprecedented, versatile, and coordinated whole-body motor
skills--spanning whole-body manipulation, legged manipulation, locomotion, and
expressive movement--using a single unified neural network controller. Our

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为LOCO的渐进式音频-语言协同学习网络，用于在弱监督场景下提升音频时间伪造定位（ATFL）性能。通过音频-语言协同学习模块和伪造定位模块，结合伪帧级标签生成和语义对比学习，LOCO在三个公开基准上实现了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ATFL方法依赖细粒度标注，成本高且在实际场景中难以获取。为解决这一问题，论文提出在弱监督下通过协同学习和自监督提升定位性能。

Method: 设计了音频-语言协同学习模块，通过语义对齐捕获伪造共识特征；采用伪造定位模块生成伪造提案；引入渐进式优化策略生成伪帧级标签，并结合语义对比学习优化特征。

Result: LOCO在三个公开基准上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LOCO通过协同学习和渐进式优化，在弱监督下显著提升了音频伪造定位性能，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio temporal forgery localization (ATFL) aims to find the precise forgery
regions of the partial spoof audio that is purposefully modified. Existing ATFL
methods rely on training efficient networks using fine-grained annotations,
which are obtained costly and challenging in real-world scenarios. To meet this
challenge, in this paper, we propose a progressive audio-language co-learning
network (LOCO) that adopts co-learning and self-supervision manners to prompt
localization performance under weak supervision scenarios. Specifically, an
audio-language co-learning module is first designed to capture forgery
consensus features by aligning semantics from temporal and global perspectives.
In this module, forgery-aware prompts are constructed by using utterance-level
annotations together with learnable prompts, which can incorporate semantic
priors into temporal content features dynamically. In addition, a forgery
localization module is applied to produce forgery proposals based on fused
forgery-class activation sequences. Finally, a progressive refinement strategy
is introduced to generate pseudo frame-level labels and leverage supervised
semantic contrastive learning to amplify the semantic distinction between real
and fake content, thereby continuously optimizing forgery-aware features.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed LOCO achieves SOTA performance on
three public benchmarks.

Result: 实验测量了编码过程中的努力程度，并分析了影响编码时间的因素（如法律知识、文本长度等）。

Conclusion: 提供了一种预测编码时间的技术，并验证了编码方法的可行性。

Abstract: Behind a set of rules in Deontic Defeasible Logic, there is a mapping process
of normative background fragments. This process goes from text to rules and
implicitly encompasses an explanation of the coded fragments.
  In this paper we deliver a methodology for \textit{legal coding} that starts
with a fragment and goes onto a set of Deontic Defeasible Logic rules,
involving a set of \textit{scenarios} to test the correctness of the coded
fragments. The methodology is illustrated by the coding process of an example
text. We then show the results of a series of experiments conducted with humans
encoding a variety of normative backgrounds and corresponding cases in which we
have measured the efforts made in the coding process, as related to some
measurable features. To process these examples, a recently developed
technology, Houdini, that allows reasoning in Deontic Defeasible Logic, has
been employed.
  Finally we provide a technique to forecast time required in coding, that
depends on factors such as knowledge of the legal domain, knowledge of the
coding processes, length of the text, and a measure of \textit{depth} that
refers to the length of the paths of legal references.

TLDR: DNAZEN是一种增强的基因组表示框架，通过多粒度学习基因序列，包括小聚合物和G-grams，并结合Transformer编码器提升表示效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接将语言建模技术应用于基因序列，未充分考虑其内在信息组织方式，尤其是不同粒度单元的贡献。

Method: 提出DNAZEN框架，通过无监督方法构建G-gram词汇表，结合Transformer编码器和动态匹配机制，并采用全G-gram掩码训练方法。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，DNAZEN在各种下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: DNAZEN通过多粒度学习和动态匹配机制，显著提升了基因序列的表示效果。

Abstract: Genome modeling conventionally treats gene sequence as a language, reflecting
its structured motifs and long-range dependencies analogous to linguistic units
and organization principles such as words and syntax. Recent studies utilize
advanced neural networks, ranging from convolutional and recurrent models to
Transformer-based models, to capture contextual information of gene sequence,
with the primary goal of obtaining effective gene sequence representations and
thus enhance the models' understanding of various running gene samples.
However, these approaches often directly apply language modeling techniques to
gene sequences and do not fully consider the intrinsic information organization
in them, where they do not consider how units at different granularities
contribute to representation. In this paper, we propose DNAZEN, an enhanced
genomic representation framework designed to learn from various granularities
in gene sequences, including small polymers and G-grams that are combinations
of several contiguous polymers. Specifically, we extract the G-grams from
large-scale genomic corpora through an unsupervised approach to construct the
G-gram vocabulary, which is used to provide G-grams in the learning process of
DNA sequences through dynamically matching from running gene samples. A
Transformer-based G-gram encoder is also proposed and the matched G-grams are
fed into it to compute their representations and integrated into the encoder
for basic unit (E4BU), which is responsible for encoding small units and
maintaining the learning and inference process. To further enhance the learning
process, we propose whole G-gram masking to train DNAZEN, where the model
largely favors the selection of each entire G-gram to mask rather than an
ordinary masking mechanism performed on basic units. Experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DNAZEN on various downstream tasks.

strategies. Finally, we highlight promising future directions, aiming to
provide a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners seeking to

TLDR: GVM-RAFT提出了一种动态样本分配策略，通过监控提示接受率和梯度范数，优化计算资源分配，显著提升了CoT推理的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如RAFT）在CoT推理中采用统一的推理预算，忽略了不同提示的难度和收敛行为差异，导致梯度估计效率低下。

Method: 提出GVM-RAFT，动态分配计算资源以最小化梯度方差，通过监控提示接受率和梯度范数实现。

Result: 实验显示GVM-RAFT在数学推理任务中比RAFT提速2-4倍，并显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: GVM-RAFT的动态采样策略具有通用性，可应用于其他强化学习算法，提升收敛速度和测试准确性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) can be
formalized as a latent variable problem, where the model needs to generate
intermediate reasoning steps. While prior approaches such as iterative
reward-ranked fine-tuning (RAFT) have relied on such formulations, they
typically apply uniform inference budgets across prompts, which fails to
account for variability in difficulty and convergence behavior. This work
identifies the main bottleneck in CoT training as inefficient stochastic
gradient estimation due to static sampling strategies. We propose GVM-RAFT, a
prompt-specific Dynamic Sample Allocation Strategy designed to minimize
stochastic gradient variance under a computational budget constraint. The
method dynamically allocates computational resources by monitoring prompt
acceptance rates and stochastic gradient norms, ensuring that the resulting
gradient variance is minimized. Our theoretical analysis shows that the
proposed dynamic sampling strategy leads to accelerated convergence guarantees
under suitable conditions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning show that
GVM-RAFT achieves a 2-4x speedup and considerable accuracy improvements over
vanilla RAFT. The proposed dynamic sampling strategy is general and can be
incorporated into other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as GRPO,
leading to similar improvements in convergence and test accuracy. Our code is

demonstrate that smaller, well-optimized architectures can achieve performance
comparable to much larger counterparts while requiring substantially fewer

custom Polish tokenizer (APT4) that significantly improves token efficiency,
Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss to balance learning across instruction
types, and Adaptive Learning Rate that dynamically adjusts based on training
progress. Trained on a meticulously curated corpus of 292 billion tokens
spanning 303 million documents, these models excel across multiple benchmarks,
including the Open PL LLM Leaderboard, Complex Polish Text Understanding
Benchmark, Polish EQ-Bench, and Polish Medical Leaderboard. The 4.5B parameter
model achieves results competitive with models 2-3 times its size, while the
1.5B model delivers strong performance despite its extremely compact profile.
These advances establish new benchmarks for parameter-efficient language
modeling in less-represented languages, making high-quality Polish language AI
more accessible for resource-constrained applications.

Result: 在Mol-Instruction和USPTO-50K数据集上表现最优，生成的化合物具有多样性和强蛋白结合亲和力。

Conclusion: ChemDual在药物设计中具有潜力，优于现有单任务方法和通用LLM。

Abstract: Chemical reaction and retrosynthesis prediction are fundamental tasks in drug
discovery. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in many
domains. However, directly applying LLMs to these tasks faces two major
challenges: (i) lacking a large-scale chemical synthesis-related instruction
dataset; (ii) ignoring the close correlation between reaction and
retrosynthesis prediction for the existing fine-tuning strategies. To address
these challenges, we propose ChemDual, a novel LLM framework for accurate
chemical synthesis. Specifically, considering the high cost of data acquisition
for reaction and retrosynthesis, ChemDual regards the
reaction-and-retrosynthesis of molecules as a related
recombination-and-fragmentation process and constructs a large-scale of 4.4
million instruction dataset. Furthermore, ChemDual introduces an enhanced
LLaMA, equipped with a multi-scale tokenizer and dual-task learning strategy,
to jointly optimize the process of recombination and fragmentation as well as
the tasks between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction. Extensive experiments
on Mol-Instruction and USPTO-50K datasets demonstrate that ChemDual achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both predictions of reaction and
retrosynthesis, outperforming the existing conventional single-task approaches
and the general open-source LLMs. Through molecular docking analysis, ChemDual
generates compounds with diverse and strong protein binding affinity, further
highlighting its strong potential in drug design.

Method: 理论分析自注意力机制的条件问题，并提出Token Graying方法作为补充。

Result: 验证了Token Graying在监督和自监督训练中的有效性。

Conclusion: 自注意力机制依赖跳跃连接，而Token Graying能进一步改善输入条件。

Abstract: We highlight a curious empirical result within modern Vision Transformers
(ViTs). Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it
is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other
elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal)
when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical
dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous
deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In
this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is
fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip
connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a
simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the
condition of input tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and
self-supervised training methods.

Abstract: We address a fundamental challenge in Reinforcement Learning from Interaction
Demonstration (RLID): demonstration noise and coverage limitations. While
existing data collection approaches provide valuable interaction
demonstrations, they often yield sparse, disconnected, and noisy trajectories
that fail to capture the full spectrum of possible skill variations and
transitions. Our key insight is that despite noisy and sparse demonstrations,
there exist infinite physically feasible trajectories that naturally bridge
between demonstrated skills or emerge from their neighboring states, forming a
continuous space of possible skill variations and transitions. Building upon
this insight, we present two data augmentation techniques: a Stitched
Trajectory Graph (STG) that discovers potential transitions between
demonstration skills, and a State Transition Field (STF) that establishes
unique connections for arbitrary states within the demonstration neighborhood.
To enable effective RLID with augmented data, we develop an Adaptive Trajectory
Sampling (ATS) strategy for dynamic curriculum generation and a historical
encoding mechanism for memory-dependent skill learning. Our approach enables
robust skill acquisition that significantly generalizes beyond the reference
demonstrations. Extensive experiments across diverse interaction tasks
demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of
convergence stability, generalization capability, and recovery robustness.

introduces a novel deep learning approach for classifying 60 different herb
species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning
techniques. Using a manually curated dataset of 12,000 herb images, we
developed a robust machine learning model that addresses existing limitations
in herb recognition methodologies. Our research employed multiple model
architectures, including DenseNet121, 50-layer Residual Network (ResNet50),
16-layer Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG16), InceptionV3, EfficientNetV2,
and Vision Transformer (VIT), with DenseNet121 ultimately demonstrating
superior performance. Data augmentation and regularization techniques were
applied to mitigate overfitting and enhance the generalizability of the model.
This work advances herb classification techniques, preserving traditional
botanical knowledge and promoting sustainable herb utilization.

Motivation: 深度神经网络易收敛到尖锐最小值，影响鲁棒性。SAM虽能寻找平坦最小值，但扰动参数时包含统计不显著方向。

Method: ZSharp在SAM基础上，应用层级的Z-score归一化和百分位过滤，保留显著梯度方向。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上，ZSharp在测试准确率上优于SAM及其变体，尤其在深层和Transformer模型中表现更佳。

Conclusion: ZSharp是一种轻量且有效的改进方法，无需架构调整即可提升泛化性能。

Abstract: Generalizing well in deep neural networks remains a core challenge,
particularly due to their tendency to converge to sharp minima that degrade
robustness. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) mitigates this by seeking
flatter minima but perturbs parameters using the full gradient, which can
include statistically insignificant directions. We propose ZSharp, a simple yet
effective extension to SAM that applies layer-wise Z-score normalization
followed by percentile-based filtering to retain only statistically significant
gradient components. This selective perturbation aligns updates with
curvature-sensitive directions, enhancing generalization without requiring
architectural changes. ZSharp introduces only one additional hyperparameter,
the percentile threshold, and remains fully compatible with existing SAM
variants. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using ResNet,
VGG, and Vision Transformers show that ZSharp consistently outperforms SAM and
its variants in test accuracy, particularly on deeper and transformer-based
models. These results demonstrate that ZSharp is a principled and lightweight
improvement for sharpness-aware optimization.
