### [1] [Training Language Models to Generate Quality Code with Program Analysis Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22704)
*Feng Yao,Zilong Wang,Liyuan Liu,Junxia Cui,Li Zhong,Xiaohan Fu,Haohui Mai,Vish Krishnan,Jianfeng Gao,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: REAL是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过程序分析和单元测试反馈，激励大型语言模型生成高质量的代码，解决了现有方法在安全性和可维护性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如监督微调和基于规则的后处理）依赖人工标注或脆弱的启发式规则，难以确保代码质量，特别是在安全性和可维护性方面。

Method: REAL结合程序分析（检测缺陷）和单元测试（确保功能正确性）的自动信号，通过强化学习框架激励模型生成高质量代码。

Result: 实验表明，REAL在功能性和代码质量评估上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: REAL填补了快速原型设计和生产级代码之间的鸿沟，使大型语言模型既能快速生成代码，又能保证质量。

Abstract: Code generation with large language models (LLMs), often termed vibe coding,
is increasingly adopted in production but fails to ensure code quality,
particularly in security (e.g., SQL injection vulnerabilities) and
maintainability (e.g., missing type annotations). Existing methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning and rule-based post-processing, rely on labor-intensive
annotations or brittle heuristics, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. We propose REAL, a reinforcement learning framework that
incentivizes LLMs to generate production-quality code using program
analysis-guided feedback. Specifically, REAL integrates two automated signals:
(1) program analysis detecting security or maintainability defects and (2) unit
tests ensuring functional correctness. Unlike prior work, our framework is
prompt-agnostic and reference-free, enabling scalable supervision without
manual intervention. Experiments across multiple datasets and model scales
demonstrate that REAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simultaneous
assessments of functionality and code quality. Our work bridges the gap between
rapid prototyping and production-ready code, enabling LLMs to deliver both
speed and quality.

### [2] [Climate Finance Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22752)
*Rafik Mankour,Yassine Chafai,Hamada Saleh,Ghassen Ben Hassine,Thibaud Barreau,Peter Tankov*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: Climate Finance Bench提出了一个开放基准，用于评估大型语言模型在企业气候披露中的问答能力，并比较了RAG方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业气候披露中的问答需求，推动透明碳报告和高效AI技术应用。

Method: 收集33份英文可持续发展报告，标注330个专家验证的问答对，比较RAG方法，分析检索器的性能瓶颈。

Result: 检索器定位答案段落的能力是主要性能瓶颈，同时强调了透明碳报告的重要性。

Conclusion: 提出了气候金融问答的基准，并呼吁在AI应用中采用更高效的量化技术以减少碳足迹。

Abstract: Climate Finance Bench introduces an open benchmark that targets
question-answering over corporate climate disclosures using Large Language
Models. We curate 33 recent sustainability reports in English drawn from
companies across all 11 GICS sectors and annotate 330 expert-validated
question-answer pairs that span pure extraction, numerical reasoning, and
logical reasoning. Building on this dataset, we propose a comparison of RAG
(retrieval-augmented generation) approaches. We show that the retriever's
ability to locate passages that actually contain the answer is the chief
performance bottleneck. We further argue for transparent carbon reporting in
AI-for-climate applications, highlighting advantages of techniques such as
Weight Quantization.

### [3] [Pre-Training Curriculum for Multi-Token Prediction in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22757)
*Ansar Aynetdinov,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种针对多令牌预测（MTP）的课程学习策略，帮助小型语言模型（SLMs）更好地利用MTP目标，提升下游任务性能和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MTP在大型语言模型中表现出色，但小型语言模型（SLMs）难以有效利用MTP目标。为了解决这一问题，作者探索了两种课程学习策略。

Method: 提出了两种课程学习策略：正向课程（从NTP逐步过渡到MTP）和反向课程（从MTP逐步过渡到NTP）。

Result: 正向课程使SLMs在预训练中更好地利用MTP，提升了下游NTP性能和生成质量，同时保留了自推测解码的优势；反向课程虽然提升了NTP性能和生成质量，但未能提供自推测解码的优势。

Conclusion: 课程学习策略（尤其是正向课程）能够帮助SLMs有效利用MTP目标，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a recently proposed pre-training objective
for language models. Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP
predicts the next $k$ tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction
heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference
speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior
work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP
objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP
training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually
increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a
reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the
forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during
pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output
quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse
curriculum achieves stronger NTP performance and output quality, but fails to
provide any self-speculative decoding benefits.

### [4] [FAMA: The First Large-Scale Open-Science Speech Foundation Model for English and Italian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22759)
*Sara Papi,Marco Gaido,Luisa Bentivogli,Alessio Brutti,Mauro Cettolo,Roberto Gretter,Marco Matassoni,Mohamed Nabih,Matteo Negri*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: FAMA是首个基于开源数据和代码的语音基础模型家族，填补了语音领域开放科学的空白，性能接近现有模型且速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音基础模型（如Whisper和SeamlessM4T）的封闭性导致可复现性和公平评估的挑战，语音领域缺乏开放科学努力。

Method: FAMA基于15万+小时的开源语音数据训练，并提供了一个包含1.6万小时清理和伪标注语音的新数据集。

Result: FAMA性能接近现有模型，速度提升高达8倍。

Conclusion: FAMA及其所有代码、数据集和模型均以开源许可发布，推动了语音技术研究的开放性。

Abstract: The development of speech foundation models (SFMs) like Whisper and
SeamlessM4T has significantly advanced the field of speech processing. However,
their closed nature--with inaccessible training data and code--poses major
reproducibility and fair evaluation challenges. While other domains have made
substantial progress toward open science by developing fully transparent models
trained on open-source (OS) code and data, similar efforts in speech remain
limited. To fill this gap, we introduce FAMA, the first family of open science
SFMs for English and Italian, trained on 150k+ hours of OS speech data.
Moreover, we present a new dataset containing 16k hours of cleaned and
pseudo-labeled speech for both languages. Results show that FAMA achieves
competitive performance compared to existing SFMs while being up to 8 times
faster. All artifacts, including code, datasets, and models, are released under
OS-compliant licenses, promoting openness in speech technology research.

### [5] [StressTest: Can YOUR Speech LM Handle the Stress?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22765)
*Iddo Yosha,Gallil Maimon,Yossi Adi*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了StressTest基准和Stress17k数据集，用于评估和提升语音感知语言模型在句子重音理解上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子重音在表达意图和含义中起关键作用，但现有语音感知语言模型（SLMs）对其关注不足。

Method: 引入StressTest基准，创建Stress17k合成数据集，并通过微调模型StresSLM提升性能。

Result: StresSLM在句子重音推理和检测任务上显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 通过合成数据微调模型能有效提升SLMs在句子重音任务上的表现。

Abstract: Sentence stress refers to emphasis, placed on specific words within a spoken
utterance to highlight or contrast an idea, or to introduce new information. It
is often used to imply an underlying intention that is not explicitly stated.
Recent advances in speech-aware language models (SLMs) have enabled direct
processing of audio, allowing models to bypass transcription and access the
full richness of the speech signal and perform audio reasoning tasks such as
spoken question answering. Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in
shaping meaning and speaker intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation
and development of such models. In this work, we address this gap by
introducing StressTest, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate a model's
ability to distinguish between interpretations of spoken sentences based on the
stress pattern. We assess the performance of several leading SLMs and find
that, despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel synthetic data generation
pipeline, and create Stress17k, a training set that simulates change of meaning
implied by stress variation. Then, we empirically show that optimizing models
with this synthetic dataset aligns well with real-world recordings and enables
effective finetuning of SLMs. Results suggest, that our finetuned model,
StresSLM, significantly outperforms existing models on both sentence stress
reasoning and detection tasks. Code, models, data, and audio samples -

### [6] [Automated Essay Scoring Incorporating Annotations from Automated Feedback Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22771)
*Christopher Ormerod*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 通过将反馈驱动的注释（如拼写、语法错误和论证成分）整合到自动作文评分（AES）中，提高了评分准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升自动作文评分的准确性，通过引入反馈驱动的注释。

Method: 使用PERSUADE语料库，整合拼写、语法错误和论证成分的注释，并利用两种LLM生成这些注释。

Result: 通过将注释整合到评分过程中，基于编码器的大型语言模型的性能得到提升。

Conclusion: 反馈驱动的注释能有效提升自动作文评分的准确性。

Abstract: This study illustrates how incorporating feedback-oriented annotations into
the scoring pipeline can enhance the accuracy of automated essay scoring (AES).
This approach is demonstrated with the Persuasive Essays for Rating, Selecting,
and Understanding Argumentative and Discourse Elements (PERSUADE) corpus. We
integrate two types of feedback-driven annotations: those that identify
spelling and grammatical errors, and those that highlight argumentative
components. To illustrate how this method could be applied in real-world
scenarios, we employ two LLMs to generate annotations -- a generative language
model used for spell-correction and an encoder-based token classifier trained
to identify and mark argumentative elements. By incorporating annotations into
the scoring process, we demonstrate improvements in performance using
encoder-based large language models fine-tuned as classifiers.

### [7] [Counting trees: A treebank-driven exploration of syntactic variation in speech and writing across languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22774)
*Kaja Dobrovoljc*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于树库的方法，通过依赖解析语料库比较口语和书面语的句法结构，发现两者在句法结构和多样性上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过依赖解析语料库，系统地比较口语和书面语的句法结构差异，揭示不同语言模态下的句法偏好。

Method: 采用自下而上的归纳方法，从英语和斯洛文尼亚语的通用依赖树库中提取去词汇化的依赖子树，分析其规模、多样性和分布。

Result: 口语语料库的句法结构数量和多样性均低于书面语，且两者间的重叠有限，表明句法组织存在模态特异性。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨语料库的句法变异研究提供了可扩展且语言无关的方法，为基于数据的语法理论奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel treebank-driven approach to comparing syntactic
structures in speech and writing using dependency-parsed corpora. Adopting a
fully inductive, bottom-up method, we define syntactic structures as
delexicalized dependency (sub)trees and extract them from spoken and written
Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks in two syntactically distinct languages,
English and Slovenian. For each corpus, we analyze the size, diversity, and
distribution of syntactic inventories, their overlap across modalities, and the
structures most characteristic of speech. Results show that, across both
languages, spoken corpora contain fewer and less diverse syntactic structures
than their written counterparts, with consistent cross-linguistic preferences
for certain structural types across modalities. Strikingly, the overlap between
spoken and written syntactic inventories is very limited: most structures
attested in speech do not occur in writing, pointing to modality-specific
preferences in syntactic organization that reflect the distinct demands of
real-time interaction and elaborated writing. This contrast is further
supported by a keyness analysis of the most frequent speech-specific
structures, which highlights patterns associated with interactivity,
context-grounding, and economy of expression. We argue that this scalable,
language-independent framework offers a useful general method for
systematically studying syntactic variation across corpora, laying the
groundwork for more comprehensive data-driven theories of grammar in use.

### [8] [MEDAL: A Framework for Benchmarking LLMs as Multilingual Open-Domain Chatbots and Dialogue Evaluators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22777)
*John Mendonça,Alon Lavie,Isabel Trancoso*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出MEDAL框架，用于生成、评估和优化多语言开放域对话评测基准，发现当前LLMs在检测细微问题（如共情和推理）方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评测数据集静态、过时且缺乏多语言覆盖，无法捕捉语言和文化差异，阻碍了聊天机器人和LLMs的进一步发展。

Method: 利用多智能体框架和先进LLMs生成多语言对话，通过GPT-4.1进行多维分析，并构建新的多语言评测基准。

Result: 发现LLMs在跨语言表现上存在显著差异，且在检测细微问题（如共情和推理）时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs作为开放域对话评测工具的能力有限，尤其在处理复杂情感和推理问题时需改进。

Abstract: As the capabilities of chatbots and their underlying LLMs continue to
dramatically improve, evaluating their performance has increasingly become a
major blocker to their further development. A major challenge is the available
benchmarking datasets, which are largely static, outdated, and lacking in
multilingual coverage, limiting their ability to capture subtle linguistic and
cultural variations. This paper introduces MEDAL, an automated multi-agent
framework for generating, evaluating, and curating more representative and
diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages
several state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues,
conditioned on varied seed contexts. A strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is then used for a
multidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering
noticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale
evaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and
human-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then
used to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act
as evaluators of open-domain dialogues. We find that current LLMs struggle to
detect nuanced issues, particularly those involving empathy and reasoning.

### [9] [Can Large Language Models Match the Conclusions of Systematic Reviews?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22787)
*Christopher Polzak,Alejandro Lozano,Min Woo Sun,James Burgess,Yuhui Zhang,Kevin Wu,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成系统性综述（SR）时是否能与临床专家的结论相匹配，并通过MedEvidence基准测试评估了24种LLMs的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着科学文献的爆炸式增长，利用LLMs自动化生成SR的需求增加，但其在批判性评估证据和多文档推理方面的能力尚不明确。

Method: 研究使用MedEvidence基准，将100篇SR与其基础研究配对，评估了24种LLMs（包括推理型、非推理型、医学专用模型及不同规模的模型）。

Result: 研究发现，推理能力不一定提升性能，模型规模增大也不总是带来增益，知识微调反而降低准确性。模型普遍表现过度自信，缺乏对低质量发现的科学怀疑。

Conclusion: LLMs目前尚无法可靠匹配专家生成的SR结论，仍需进一步研究。研究团队公开了代码和基准以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Systematic reviews (SR), in which experts summarize and analyze evidence
across individual studies to provide insights on a specialized topic, are a
cornerstone for evidence-based clinical decision-making, research, and policy.
Given the exponential growth of scientific articles, there is growing interest
in using large language models (LLMs) to automate SR generation. However, the
ability of LLMs to critically assess evidence and reason across multiple
documents to provide recommendations at the same proficiency as domain experts
remains poorly characterized. We therefore ask: Can LLMs match the conclusions
of systematic reviews written by clinical experts when given access to the same
studies? To explore this question, we present MedEvidence, a benchmark pairing
findings from 100 SRs with the studies they are based on. We benchmark 24 LLMs
on MedEvidence, including reasoning, non-reasoning, medical specialist, and
models across varying sizes (from 7B-700B). Through our systematic evaluation,
we find that reasoning does not necessarily improve performance, larger models
do not consistently yield greater gains, and knowledge-based fine-tuning
degrades accuracy on MedEvidence. Instead, most models exhibit similar
behavior: performance tends to degrade as token length increases, their
responses show overconfidence, and, contrary to human experts, all models show
a lack of scientific skepticism toward low-quality findings. These results
suggest that more work is still required before LLMs can reliably match the
observations from expert-conducted SRs, even though these systems are already
deployed and being used by clinicians. We release our codebase and benchmark to
the broader research community to further investigate LLM-based SR systems.

### [10] [Towards a More Generalized Approach in Open Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22801)
*Qing Wang,Yuepei Li,Qiao Qiao,Kang Zhou,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: MixORE是一个两阶段框架，用于在混合已知和未知关系的未标记数据中联合学习关系分类和聚类，优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，未知关系是随机分布的，传统OpenRE方法无法处理这种混合数据。

Method: 提出MixORE框架，结合关系分类和聚类，分两阶段处理混合数据。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，MixORE在已知关系分类和未知关系聚类中表现优于基线。

Conclusion: MixORE推动了广义OpenRE研究和实际应用的进展。

Abstract: Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) seeks to identify and extract novel
relational facts between named entities from unlabeled data without pre-defined
relation schemas. Traditional OpenRE methods typically assume that the
unlabeled data consists solely of novel relations or is pre-divided into known
and novel instances. However, in real-world scenarios, novel relations are
arbitrarily distributed. In this paper, we propose a generalized OpenRE setting
that considers unlabeled data as a mixture of both known and novel instances.
To address this, we propose MixORE, a two-phase framework that integrates
relation classification and clustering to jointly learn known and novel
relations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MixORE
consistently outperforms competitive baselines in known relation classification
and novel relation clustering. Our findings contribute to the advancement of
generalized OpenRE research and real-world applications.

### [11] [First Steps Towards Overhearing LLM Agents: A Case Study With Dungeons & Dragons Gameplay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22809)
*Andrew Zhu,Evan Osgood,Chris Callison-Burch*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为“偷听代理”的新型LLM交互范式，通过监听人类对话提供背景任务支持，并以《龙与地下城》游戏为例进行了研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM代理在非直接对话场景中的应用，通过监听人类对话提供辅助，扩展LLM的使用场景。

Method: 使用大型多模态音频-语言模型作为偷听代理，辅助游戏主持人，并通过人类评估验证其有效性。

Result: 研究发现某些大型音频-语言模型具备通过隐式音频线索完成偷听代理任务的涌现能力。

Conclusion: 偷听代理是一种有潜力的LLM交互范式，研究提供了相关工具和代码以支持进一步探索。

Abstract: Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist
human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with
LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not
actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on
human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide
suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents
paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an
in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing
agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the
helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have
the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio
cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support
further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at
https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.

### [12] [Self-Critique and Refinement for Faithful Natural Language Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22823)
*Yingming Wang,Pepa Atanasova*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出SR-NLE框架，通过自我批评和迭代优化提升大语言模型生成的自然语言解释的忠实度，无需外部监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型的自然语言解释常无法忠实反映其推理过程，需改进解释的忠实性。

Method: 引入SR-NLE框架，利用自然语言自我反馈和基于特征归因的新反馈机制，迭代优化解释。

Result: 实验表明SR-NLE显著降低不忠实率，最佳方法平均不忠实率降至36.02%，比基线降低18.79%。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可通过反馈机制优化解释忠实度，无需额外训练或微调。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), natural language
explanations (NLEs) have become increasingly important for understanding model
predictions. However, these explanations often fail to faithfully represent the
model's actual reasoning process. While existing work has demonstrated that
LLMs can self-critique and refine their initial outputs for various tasks, this
capability remains unexplored for improving explanation faithfulness. To
address this gap, we introduce Self-critique and Refinement for Natural
Language Explanations (SR-NLE), a framework that enables models to improve the
faithfulness of their own explanations -- specifically, post-hoc NLEs --
through an iterative critique and refinement process without external
supervision. Our framework leverages different feedback mechanisms to guide the
refinement process, including natural language self-feedback and, notably, a
novel feedback approach based on feature attribution that highlights important
input words. Our experiments across three datasets and four state-of-the-art
LLMs demonstrate that SR-NLE significantly reduces unfaithfulness rates, with
our best method achieving an average unfaithfulness rate of 36.02%, compared to
54.81% for baseline -- an absolute reduction of 18.79%. These findings reveal
that the investigated LLMs can indeed refine their explanations to better
reflect their actual reasoning process, requiring only appropriate guidance
through feedback without additional training or fine-tuning.

### [13] [What Has Been Lost with Synthetic Evaluation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22830)
*Alexander Gill,Abhilasha Ravichander,Ana Marasović*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: LLMs可用于生成评估基准，但生成的基准对LLMs自身挑战性较低，需谨慎评估其使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs生成评估基准的有效性，以降低成本和提升效率。

Method: 通过两个案例研究（CondaQA和DROP），比较LLM生成与人工众包的基准。

Result: LLM生成的基准成本低且有效，但对LLMs挑战性不足。

Conclusion: 需重新评估LLMs生成基准的适用性，避免潜在缺陷。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for data generation.
However, creating evaluation benchmarks raises the bar for this emerging
paradigm. Benchmarks must target specific phenomena, penalize exploiting
shortcuts, and be challenging. Through two case studies, we investigate whether
LLMs can meet these demands by generating reasoning over-text benchmarks and
comparing them to those created through careful crowdsourcing. Specifically, we
evaluate both the validity and difficulty of LLM-generated versions of two
high-quality reading comprehension datasets: CondaQA, which evaluates reasoning
about negation, and DROP, which targets reasoning about quantities. We find
that prompting LLMs can produce variants of these datasets that are often valid
according to the annotation guidelines, at a fraction of the cost of the
original crowdsourcing effort. However, we show that they are less challenging
for LLMs than their human-authored counterparts. This finding sheds light on
what may have been lost by generating evaluation data with LLMs, and calls for
critically reassessing the immediate use of this increasingly prevalent
approach to benchmark creation.

*Arthur S. Bianchessi,Rodrigo C. Barros,Lucas S. Kupssinskü*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为BAM的理论框架，将位置编码建模为概率模型中的先验，统一了现有方法并显著提升了长上下文泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置编码方法缺乏理论清晰性，且依赖有限的评估指标来支持其外推能力。

Method: 提出贝叶斯注意力机制（BAM），将位置编码作为概率模型中的先验，并引入广义高斯位置先验。

Result: BAM在500倍训练上下文长度下仍能准确检索信息，优于现有方法，同时保持困惑度并仅引入少量额外参数。

Conclusion: BAM为位置编码提供了理论框架，显著提升了长上下文泛化性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models rely on positional encoding (PE) to handle
token order and support context length extrapolation. However, existing PE
methods lack theoretical clarity and rely on limited evaluation metrics to
substantiate their extrapolation claims. We propose the Bayesian Attention
Mechanism (BAM), a theoretical framework that formulates positional encoding as
a prior within a probabilistic model. BAM unifies existing methods (e.g., NoPE
and ALiBi) and motivates a new Generalized Gaussian positional prior that
substantially improves long-context generalization. Empirically, BAM enables
accurate information retrieval at $500\times$ the training context length,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art context length generalization in long
context retrieval accuracy while maintaining comparable perplexity and
introducing minimal additional parameters.

*Pingjun Hong,Beiduo Chen,Siyao Peng,Marie-Catherine de Marneffe,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出LITEX分类法，用于分析自然语言推理（NLI）中标注者解释的多样性，并通过实验验证其在解释生成中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究NLI中标注者解释的多样性问题，尤其是同一标签下不同推理的挑战。

Method: 引入LITEX分类法，标注e-SNLI数据集，验证分类法可靠性，并分析其与标签、高亮和解释的关联。

Result: LITEX生成的解释在语言学上更接近人类解释，优于仅基于标签或高亮的生成方法。

Conclusion: LITEX能有效捕捉标签内多样性，并通过分类法指导的生成方法缩小人类与模型解释的差距。

Abstract: There is increasing evidence of Human Label Variation (HLV) in Natural
Language Inference (NLI), where annotators assign different labels to the same
premise-hypothesis pair. However, within-label variation--cases where
annotators agree on the same label but provide divergent reasoning--poses an
additional and mostly overlooked challenge. Several NLI datasets contain
highlighted words in the NLI item as explanations, but the same spans on the
NLI item can be highlighted for different reasons, as evidenced by free-text
explanations, which offer a window into annotators' reasoning. To
systematically understand this problem and gain insight into the rationales
behind NLI labels, we introduce LITEX, a linguistically-informed taxonomy for
categorizing free-text explanations. Using this taxonomy, we annotate a subset
of the e-SNLI dataset, validate the taxonomy's reliability, and analyze how it
aligns with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. We further assess the
taxonomy's usefulness in explanation generation, demonstrating that
conditioning generation on LITEX yields explanations that are linguistically
closer to human explanations than those generated using only labels or
highlights. Our approach thus not only captures within-label variation but also
shows how taxonomy-guided generation for reasoning can bridge the gap between
human and model explanations more effectively than existing strategies.

Motivation: 在线新闻的激增和虚假信息的传播需要自动数据分析方法，叙事分类成为重要任务。

Method: 采用分层三步骤提示策略，通过大型语言模型（LLM）逐步分类新闻文章的主叙事和子叙事。

Result: 在28个全球竞争团队中，该方法在英语测试集上排名第一。

Conclusion: H3Prompt方法在多语言叙事分类任务中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: The proliferation of online news and the increasing spread of misinformation
necessitate robust methods for automatic data analysis. Narrative
classification is emerging as a important task, since identifying what is being
said online is critical for fact-checkers, policy markers and other
professionals working on information studies. This paper presents our approach
to SemEval 2025 Task 10 Subtask 2, which aims to classify news articles into a
pre-defined two-level taxonomy of main narratives and sub-narratives across
multiple languages.
  We propose Hierarchical Three-Step Prompting (H3Prompt) for multilingual
narrative classification. Our methodology follows a three-step Large Language
Model (LLM) prompting strategy, where the model first categorises an article
into one of two domains (Ukraine-Russia War or Climate Change), then identifies
the most relevant main narratives, and finally assigns sub-narratives. Our
approach secured the top position on the English test set among 28 competing
teams worldwide. The code is available at https://github.com/GateNLP/H3Prompt.

TLDR: 论文探讨了大型推理模型（LRMs）在多语言推理能力上的不足，发现现有模型在非英语推理任务中表现不佳，并提出干预措施和改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言推理能力的重要性，因为用户需要以母语理解推理过程以实现有效监督。

Method: 评估两种主流LRMs在XReasoning基准上的表现，采用提示干预和针对性训练。

Result: 发现模型在多语言推理中表现不佳，提示干预提高可读性但降低准确性，针对性训练部分缓解问题。

Conclusion: 当前LRMs的多语言推理能力有限，需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with thinking traces have shown strong
performance on English reasoning tasks. However, their ability to think in
other languages is less studied. This capability is as important as answer
accuracy for real world applications because users may find the reasoning trace
useful for oversight only when it is expressed in their own language. We
comprehensively evaluate two leading families of LRMs on our XReasoning
benchmark and find that even the most advanced models often revert to English
or produce fragmented reasoning in other languages, revealing a substantial gap
in multilingual reasoning. Prompt based interventions that force models to
reason in the users language improve readability and oversight but reduce
answer accuracy, exposing an important trade off. We further show that targeted
post training on just 100 examples mitigates this mismatch, though some
accuracy loss remains. Our results highlight the limited multilingual reasoning
capabilities of current LRMs and outline directions for future work. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/Betswish/mCoT-XReasoning.

TLDR: VIGNETTE是一个大规模VQA基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的偏见，涵盖事实性、感知、刻板印象和决策四个方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM偏见研究多局限于肖像图像和性别职业关联，忽视了更广泛的社会刻板印象及其潜在危害。

Method: 通过30M+图像的问答框架，结合社会心理学，分析VLMs如何从视觉线索推断特质和角色。

Result: 揭示了VLMs中微妙、多面且令人惊讶的刻板模式，展示了模型如何从输入构建社会意义。

Conclusion: VIGNETTE为理解VLMs中的偏见提供了新视角，揭示了其对社会意义的编码方式。

Abstract: While bias in large language models (LLMs) is well-studied, similar concerns
in vision-language models (VLMs) have received comparatively less attention.
Existing VLM bias studies often focus on portrait-style images and
gender-occupation associations, overlooking broader and more complex social
stereotypes and their implied harm. This work introduces VIGNETTE, a
large-scale VQA benchmark with 30M+ images for evaluating bias in VLMs through
a question-answering framework spanning four directions: factuality,
perception, stereotyping, and decision making. Beyond narrowly-centered
studies, we assess how VLMs interpret identities in contextualized settings,
revealing how models make trait and capability assumptions and exhibit patterns
of discrimination. Drawing from social psychology, we examine how VLMs connect
visual identity cues to trait and role-based inferences, encoding social
hierarchies, through biased selections. Our findings uncover subtle,
multifaceted, and surprising stereotypical patterns, offering insights into how
VLMs construct social meaning from inputs.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于认知的偏见评估框架，用于分析LLM如何将事件结果归因于不同人口群体，揭示其推理差异如何导致偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨LLM在归因事件结果时是否存在基于人口统计的偏见，及其公平性影响。

Method: 提出了一种基于认知的偏见评估框架，分析LLM如何将事件结果归因于内部或外部因素。

Result: 揭示了LLM的推理差异如何导致对特定人口群体的偏见。

Conclusion: 结论强调了评估和解决LLM中基于认知的偏见的重要性，以确保公平性。

Abstract: When a student fails an exam, do we tend to blame their effort or the test's
difficulty? Attribution, defined as how reasons are assigned to event outcomes,
shapes perceptions, reinforces stereotypes, and influences decisions.
Attribution Theory in social psychology explains how humans assign
responsibility for events using implicit cognition, attributing causes to
internal (e.g., effort, ability) or external (e.g., task difficulty, luck)
factors. LLMs' attribution of event outcomes based on demographics carries
important fairness implications. Most works exploring social biases in LLMs
focus on surface-level associations or isolated stereotypes. This work proposes
a cognitively grounded bias evaluation framework to identify how models'
reasoning disparities channelize biases toward demographic groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估多依赖昂贵的人工标注，且未能全面反映临床推理或急诊工作流程，因此设计了ER-Reason以填补这一空白。

Method: ER-Reason包含3984名患者的25174份纵向临床记录，覆盖急诊工作流程的多个阶段，并收集了72份医生撰写的推理过程。

Result: 评估显示，当前大型语言模型在急诊决策中的临床推理与医生存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 未来研究需缩小模型与临床医生在急诊推理上的差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated on medical
question answering tasks based on licensing exams. However, real-world
evaluations often depend on costly human annotators, and existing benchmarks
tend to focus on isolated tasks that rarely capture the clinical reasoning or
full workflow underlying medical decisions. In this paper, we introduce
ER-Reason, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based clinical reasoning and
decision-making in the emergency room (ER)--a high-stakes setting where
clinicians make rapid, consequential decisions across diverse patient
presentations and medical specialties under time pressure. ER-Reason includes
data from 3,984 patients, encompassing 25,174 de-identified longitudinal
clinical notes spanning discharge summaries, progress notes, history and
physical exams, consults, echocardiography reports, imaging notes, and ER
provider documentation. The benchmark includes evaluation tasks that span key
stages of the ER workflow: triage intake, initial assessment, treatment
selection, disposition planning, and final diagnosis--each structured to
reflect core clinical reasoning processes such as differential diagnosis via
rule-out reasoning. We also collected 72 full physician-authored rationales
explaining reasoning processes that mimic the teaching process used in
residency training, and are typically absent from ER documentation. Evaluations
of state-of-the-art LLMs on ER-Reason reveal a gap between LLM-generated and
clinician-authored clinical reasoning for ER decisions, highlighting the need
for future research to bridge this divide.

Conclusion: 研究证实了记忆机制在语言理解中的关键作用，展示了所提方法在设计和性能上的可行性与有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large language models in
understanding long-term context. It proposes a model architecture equipped with
a long-term memory mechanism to improve the retention and retrieval of semantic
information across paragraphs and dialogue turns. The model integrates explicit
memory units, gated writing mechanisms, and attention-based reading modules. A
forgetting function is introduced to enable dynamic updates of memory content,
enhancing the model's ability to manage historical information. To further
improve the effectiveness of memory operations, the study designs a joint
training objective. This combines the main task loss with constraints on memory
writing and forgetting. It guides the model to learn better memory strategies
during task execution. Systematic evaluation across multiple subtasks shows
that the model achieves clear advantages in text generation consistency,
stability in multi-turn question answering, and accuracy in cross-context
reasoning. In particular, the model demonstrates strong semantic retention and
contextual coherence in long-text tasks and complex question answering
scenarios. It effectively mitigates the context loss and semantic drift
problems commonly faced by traditional language models when handling long-term
dependencies. The experiments also include analysis of different memory
structures, capacity sizes, and control strategies. These results further
confirm the critical role of memory mechanisms in language understanding. They
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in both
architectural design and performance outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法在LoRA微调模型上表现不佳，导致性能下降。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出OSRM方法，在微调前约束LoRA子空间，确保任务更新不干扰其他任务。

Result: 实验表明，OSRM提升了合并性能，保持了单任务准确性，并对超参数更鲁棒。

Conclusion: OSRM为LoRA模型合并提供了一种即插即用的解决方案，强调了数据与参数交互的重要性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LMs) for individual tasks yields strong
performance but is expensive for deployment and storage. Recent works explore
model merging to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task
model without additional training. However, existing merging methods often fail
for models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), due to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we show that this issue arises from a
previously overlooked interplay between model parameters and data
distributions. We propose Orthogonal Subspaces for Robust model Merging (OSRM)
to constrain the LoRA subspace *prior* to fine-tuning, ensuring that updates
relevant to one task do not adversely shift outputs for others. Our approach
can seamlessly integrate with most existing merging algorithms, reducing the
unintended interference among tasks. Extensive experiments on eight datasets,
tested with three widely used LMs and two large LMs, demonstrate that our
method not only boosts merging performance but also preserves single-task
accuracy. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater robustness to the
hyperparameters of merging. These results highlight the importance of
data-parameter interaction in model merging and offer a plug-and-play solution
for merging LoRA models.

Abstract: This study presents an efficient transformer-based question-answering (QA)
model optimized for deployment on a 13th Gen Intel i7-1355U CPU, using the

Motivation: 现有基于监督微调的网页代理在动态网页交互中泛化性和鲁棒性不足，需提升推理能力。

Method: 采用规则化R1强化学习框架，通过结构化奖励函数评估输出格式和动作正确性，隐式学习中间推理。

Result: 在WorkArena基准测试中，WorkForceAgent-R1比SFT基线提升10.26-16.59%，性能接近GPT-4o。

Conclusion: WorkForceAgent-R1通过强化学习显著提升了网页导航任务的性能，适用于企业环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered web agents enables automating complex,
real-time web navigation tasks in enterprise environments. However, existing
web agents relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggle with
generalization and robustness due to insufficient reasoning capabilities when
handling the inherently dynamic nature of web interactions. In this study, we
introduce WorkForceAgent-R1, an LLM-based web agent trained using a rule-based
R1-style reinforcement learning framework designed explicitly to enhance
single-step reasoning and planning for business-oriented web navigation tasks.
We employ a structured reward function that evaluates both adherence to output
formats and correctness of actions, enabling WorkForceAgent-R1 to implicitly
learn robust intermediate reasoning without explicit annotations or extensive
expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments on the WorkArena benchmark
demonstrate that WorkForceAgent-R1 substantially outperforms SFT baselines by
10.26-16.59%, achieving competitive performance relative to proprietary
LLM-based agents (gpt-4o) in workplace-oriented web navigation tasks.

Motivation: 预训练多模态表示（如CLIP）虽然表现出强大的能力，但在组合性上存在显著漏洞，导致反直觉的判断。论文旨在揭示并解决这些漏洞。

Method: 提出MAC基准，利用LLMs生成欺骗性文本样本，并通过自训练方法（拒绝采样微调和多样性促进过滤）提升攻击成功率和样本多样性。

Result: 使用较小语言模型（如Llama-3.1-8B）的方法在多模态表示（图像、视频、音频）中表现出更高的攻击成功率和多样性。

Conclusion: MAC基准和自训练方法有效揭示了多模态表示的组合性漏洞，并提升了零样本方法的性能。

Abstract: While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown
impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities
leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial
Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across
different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success
rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we
propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning
with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and
sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach
demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities
across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and
audios.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在多语言和跨语言环境下的记忆能力，特别是未直接训练的语言翻译内容是否能被回忆。

Method: 使用OWL数据集（31.5K对齐文本，10种语言），通过直接探测、名称填空和前缀生成三种任务评估模型记忆能力。

Result: LLMs能跨语言回忆内容，GPT-4o在新翻译文本中识别作者和标题的准确率为69%，实体填空为6%。扰动（如打乱单词）对准确率影响较小。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs的跨语言记忆能力，并提供了模型间差异的见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize and recall English text
from their pretraining data. However, the extent to which this ability
generalizes to non-English languages or transfers across languages remains
unclear. This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in
LLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be
recalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset
of 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English
originals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new
translations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili,
Malagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families
and sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to
identify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting
masked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating
continuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages,
even for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for
example, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6%
of the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking
characters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop
for shuffled official translations). Our results highlight the extent of
cross-lingual memorization and provide insights on the differences between the
models.

Result: 评估20个最先进的VLMs发现，它们在否定问题上表现显著下降，且模型规模与性能呈U型关系。

Conclusion: NegVQA揭示了VLMs在否定理解上的关键不足，为未来VLM发展提供了方向。

Abstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that can entirely reverse the
meaning of a sentence. As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and
are deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend
negation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions
covering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We
construct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated
versions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20
state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models
struggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop
compared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover
a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades
performance on NegVQA before leading to improvements. Our benchmark reveals
critical gaps in VLMs' negation understanding and offers insights into future
VLM development. Project page available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在零样本摘要中表现优异，但难以建模长文本结构和识别关键信息。

Method: StrucSum通过三种策略注入结构信号：邻居感知提示（NAP）、中心性感知提示（CAP）和中心性引导掩码（CGM）。

Result: 在ArXiv、PubMed和Multi-News数据集上，StrucSum显著优于无监督基线和普通提示方法，FactCC和SummaC分数分别提升19.2和9.7。

Conclusion: 结构感知提示是一种简单有效的零样本抽取式摘要方法，无需训练或任务特定调整。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot
summarization, but often struggle to model document structure and identify
salient information in long texts. In this work, we introduce StrucSum, a
training-free prompting framework that enhances LLM reasoning through
sentence-level graph structures. StrucSum injects structural signals into
prompts via three targeted strategies: Neighbor-Aware Prompting (NAP) for local
context, Centrality-Aware Prompting (CAP) for importance estimation, and
Centrality-Guided Masking (CGM) for efficient input reduction. Experiments on
ArXiv, PubMed, and Multi-News demonstrate that StrucSum consistently improves
both summary quality and factual consistency over unsupervised baselines and
vanilla prompting. Notably, on ArXiv, it boosts FactCC and SummaC by 19.2 and
9.7 points, indicating stronger alignment between summaries and source content.
These findings suggest that structure-aware prompting is a simple yet effective
approach for zero-shot extractive summarization with LLMs, without any training
or task-specific tuning.

Conclusion: LLMs在自动化论点分析中具有潜力，但仍存在局限性，需进一步改进以支持下游应用。

Abstract: Automated large-scale analysis of public discussions around contested issues
like abortion requires detecting and understanding the use of arguments. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in language processing tasks,
their performance in mining topic-specific, pre-defined arguments in online
comments remains underexplored. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on three
argument mining tasks using datasets comprising over 2,000 opinion comments
across six polarizing topics. Quantitative evaluation suggests an overall
strong performance across the three tasks, especially for large and fine-tuned
LLMs, albeit at a significant environmental cost. However, a detailed error
analysis revealed systematic shortcomings on long and nuanced comments and
emotionally charged language, raising concerns for downstream applications like
content moderation or opinion analysis. Our results highlight both the promise
and current limitations of LLMs for automated argument analysis in online
comments.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在HSE领域的专业知识和结构化法律推理能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 构建HSE-Bench数据集，采用IRAC推理流程评估LLMs，并提出RoE提示技术模拟专家推理。

Result: 当前LLMs表现良好但依赖语义匹配，缺乏系统性法律推理能力。RoE技术能提升准确性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在HSE合规性评估中的推理缺陷，RoE技术为改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) compliance assessment demands dynamic
real-time decision-making under complicated regulations and complex
human-machine-environment interactions. While large language models (LLMs) hold
significant potential for decision intelligence and contextual dialogue, their
capacity for domain-specific knowledge in HSE and structured legal reasoning
remains underexplored. We introduce HSE-Bench, the first benchmark dataset
designed to evaluate the HSE compliance assessment capabilities of LLM.
HSE-Bench comprises over 1,000 manually curated questions drawn from
regulations, court cases, safety exams, and fieldwork videos, and integrates a
reasoning flow based on Issue spotting, rule Recall, rule Application, and rule
Conclusion (IRAC) to assess the holistic reasoning pipeline. We conduct
extensive evaluations on different prompting strategies and more than 10 LLMs,
including foundation models, reasoning models and multimodal vision models. The
results show that, although current LLMs achieve good performance, their
capabilities largely rely on semantic matching rather than principled reasoning
grounded in the underlying HSE compliance context. Moreover, their native
reasoning trace lacks the systematic legal reasoning required for rigorous HSE
compliance assessment. To alleviate these, we propose a new prompting
technique, Reasoning of Expert (RoE), which guides LLMs to simulate the
reasoning process of different experts for compliance assessment and reach a
more accurate unified decision. We hope our study highlights reasoning gaps in
LLMs for HSE compliance and inspires further research on related tasks.

while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions
proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind

address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader
(ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by
incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness
and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by
prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central
claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to
predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully
designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to
analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective
arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B
parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative
gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably,
ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training,
which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature
of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ
more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our
method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more
persuasive language agents. Code is available at:

TLDR: 本文首次研究了电子健康记录（EHR）基础模型的扩展规律，发现其与大型语言模型（LLM）类似，具有可预测的性能提升规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索EHR数据的扩展规律，以填补其在模型规模、计算资源和数据量方面的研究空白，并推动个性化医疗的发展。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据库中的患者时间线数据，训练不同规模和计算预算的Transformer架构，分析扩展模式。

Result: 发现EHR模型表现出与LLM类似的扩展行为，包括抛物线IsoFLOPs曲线和计算、模型参数、数据量与临床效用之间的幂律关系。

Conclusion: EHR基础模型的扩展规律为资源高效的训练策略提供了预测性见解，为临床预测任务和个性化医疗的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large
language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through
systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these
principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health
records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that
differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first
empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training
transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database
across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling
patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships
between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These
findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to
LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies.
Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models
capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized
healthcare.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: VeGraph是一个基于LLM的框架，通过图表示、实体消歧和验证三阶段解决复杂声明的验证问题，性能优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声明验证方法在复杂语义或模糊实体处理上不足，需更高效且可解释的解决方案。

Method: VeGraph分三阶段：图表示（结构化三元组）、实体消歧（与知识库交互）、验证（完成事实检查）。

Result: 在HoVer和FEVEROUS基准上，VeGraph表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VeGraph有效解决了复杂声明验证的挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Claim verification is a long-standing and challenging task that demands not
only high accuracy but also explainability of the verification process. This
task becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models
(LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic
structures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address
this by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to
resolve hidden or ambiguous entities. However, the absence of effective
disambiguation strategies for these entities can compromise the entire
verification process. To address these challenges, we propose
Verify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and
comprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1)
Graph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets,
forming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and
unstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively
interacts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the
graph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining
triplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process. Experiments using
Meta-Llama-3-70B (instruct version) show that VeGraph achieves competitive
performance compared to baselines on two benchmarks HoVer and FEVEROUS,
effectively addressing claim verification challenges. Our source code and data
are available for further exploitation.

*Yize Cheng,Wenxiao Wang,Mazda Moayeri,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: DyePack是一个通过后门攻击检测模型是否在训练中使用基准测试集的框架，无需访问模型内部细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放基准测试容易被污染，需要一种透明且可复现的方法来检测模型是否在训练中使用了测试集。

Method: DyePack通过在测试数据中混入后门样本，利用随机目标的多后门设计，确保低误报率。

Result: 在多项选择和开放式生成任务中，DyePack成功检测所有污染模型，误报率极低。

Conclusion: DyePack提供了一种可靠且高效的方法来检测测试集污染，保障基准测试的公正性。

Abstract: Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language
models, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility
makes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce
DyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that
used benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss,
logits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with
their money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data
to flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating
multiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate
(FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false
accusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of
contamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets,
covering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For
multiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with
guaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard
using eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and
identifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive
rate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to significant
improvements in various service domains, including search, recommendation, and
chatbot applications. However, applying state-of-the-art (SOTA) research to
industrial settings presents challenges, as it requires maintaining flexible
conversational abilities while also strictly complying with service-specific
constraints. This can be seen as two conflicting requirements due to the
probabilistic nature of LLMs. In this paper, we propose our approach to
addressing this challenge and detail the strategies we employed to overcome
their inherent limitations in real-world applications. We conduct a practical
case study of a conversational agent designed for the e-commerce domain,
detailing our implementation workflow and optimizations. Our findings provide
insights into bridging the gap between academic research and real-world
application, introducing a framework for developing scalable, controllable, and
reliable AI-driven agents.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于参考过滤和TF-IDF聚类（RFTC）的方法，用于检测LLMs中的隐蔽后门样本，解决了现有方法在生成任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法无法适用于生成任务或可能降低生成性能，因此需要一种高效消除隐蔽后门样本的方法。

Method: 通过参考模型输出对比筛选可疑样本，再对可疑样本进行TF-IDF聚类，根据类内距离识别真正的中毒样本。

Result: 在两个机器翻译数据集和一个QA数据集上的实验表明，RFTC在检测后门和模型性能上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RFTC方法有效解决了隐蔽后门样本的检测问题，且参考过滤机制被证明是有效的。

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs with datasets containing stealthy backdoors from publishers
poses security risks to downstream applications. Mainstream detection methods
either identify poisoned samples by analyzing the prediction probability of
poisoned classification models or rely on the rewriting model to eliminate the
stealthy triggers. However, the former cannot be applied to generation tasks,
while the latter may degrade generation performance and introduce new triggers.
Therefore, efficiently eliminating stealthy poisoned samples for LLMs remains
an urgent problem. We observe that after applying TF-IDF clustering to the
sample response, there are notable differences in the intra-class distances
between clean and poisoned samples. Poisoned samples tend to cluster closely
because of their specific malicious outputs, whereas clean samples are more
scattered due to their more varied responses. Thus, in this paper, we propose a
stealthy backdoor sample detection method based on Reference-Filtration and
Tfidf-Clustering mechanisms (RFTC). Specifically, we first compare the sample
response with the reference model's outputs and consider the sample suspicious
if there's a significant discrepancy. And then we perform TF-IDF clustering on
these suspicious samples to identify the true poisoned samples based on the
intra-class distance. Experiments on two machine translation datasets and one
QA dataset demonstrate that RFTC outperforms baselines in backdoor detection
and model performance. Further analysis of different reference models also
confirms the effectiveness of our Reference-Filtration.

TLDR: 该论文提出了CHED基准和CoRE方法，用于评估和改进知识编辑（KE）方法在上下文存在时的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KE评估通常忽略上下文对知识编辑的影响，而实际应用中上下文可能触发原始知识，削弱编辑效果。

Method: 开发了CHED基准评估KE方法的上下文鲁棒性，并提出CoRE方法，通过最小化隐藏状态的上下文敏感方差来增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，现有KE方法在上下文存在时效果不佳，而CoRE方法显著提高了编辑成功率并保持模型能力。

Conclusion: CoRE方法有效解决了上下文对知识编辑的干扰问题，为KE方法提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) methods offer an efficient way to modify knowledge in
large language models. Current KE evaluations typically assess editing success
by considering only the edited knowledge without any preceding contexts. In
real-world applications, however, preceding contexts often trigger the
retrieval of the original knowledge and undermine the intended edit. To address
this issue, we develop CHED -- a benchmark designed to evaluate the context
robustness of KE methods. Evaluations on CHED show that they often fail when
preceding contexts are present. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce
CoRE, a KE method designed to strengthen context robustness by minimizing
context-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge.
This method not only improves the editing success rate in situations where a
preceding context is present but also preserves the overall capabilities of the
model. We provide an in-depth analysis of the differing impacts of preceding
contexts when introduced as user utterances versus assistant responses, and we
dissect attention-score patterns to assess how specific tokens influence
editing success.

Motivation: 图像性和具体性是连接视觉和语义空间的心理语言学属性，现有方法依赖多模态数据。本文假设仅文本数据即可准确估计这些属性。

Method: 提出NSM方法，量化语义嵌入空间中单词邻域的峰值程度，无需监督或分布假设。

Result: NSM与真实评分的相关性优于现有无监督方法，且在分类任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: 仅文本数据即可有效估计图像性和具体性，NSM是一种高效的无监督方法。

Abstract: Imageability (potential of text to evoke a mental image) and concreteness
(perceptibility of text) are two psycholinguistic properties that link visual
and semantic spaces. It is little surprise that computational methods that
estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as
collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we
work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers
sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in
particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic
embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then
propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood
Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive
experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings
than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these
properties for classification. Our code and data are available on GitHub

Motivation: 评估通用临床NLP工具在儿科CXR报告标签任务中的表现，填补独立评估的空白。

Method: 使用四种商业NLP系统（AWS、GC、AZ、SP）和两种专用工具（CheXpert、CheXbert）处理95,008份儿科CXR报告，提取实体和断言状态，并与伪真实值比较。

Result: SP提取最多实体（49,688），断言准确率最高（76%）；AWS最低（50%）。专用工具准确率为56%。

Conclusion: NLP工具性能差异显著，临床部署前需仔细验证。

Abstract: General-purpose clinical natural language processing (NLP) tools are
increasingly used for the automatic labeling of clinical reports. However,
independent evaluations for specific tasks, such as pediatric chest radiograph
(CXR) report labeling, are limited. This study compares four commercial
clinical NLP systems - Amazon Comprehend Medical (AWS), Google Healthcare NLP
(GC), Azure Clinical NLP (AZ), and SparkNLP (SP) - for entity extraction and
assertion detection in pediatric CXR reports. Additionally, CheXpert and
CheXbert, two dedicated chest radiograph report labelers, were evaluated on the
same task using CheXpert-defined labels. We analyzed 95,008 pediatric CXR
reports from a large academic pediatric hospital. Entities and assertion
statuses (positive, negative, uncertain) from the findings and impression
sections were extracted by the NLP systems, with impression section entities
mapped to 12 disease categories and a No Findings category. CheXpert and
CheXbert extracted the same 13 categories. Outputs were compared using Fleiss
Kappa and accuracy against a consensus pseudo-ground truth. Significant
differences were found in the number of extracted entities and assertion
distributions across NLP systems. SP extracted 49,688 unique entities, GC
16,477, AZ 31,543, and AWS 27,216. Assertion accuracy across models averaged
around 62%, with SP highest (76%) and AWS lowest (50%). CheXpert and CheXbert
achieved 56% accuracy. Considerable variability in performance highlights the
need for careful validation and review before deploying NLP tools for clinical
report labeling.

Motivation: 研究动机在于理解人类与AI持续互动如何塑造MFE，并探讨其对语言丰富性和沟通效率的影响。

Method: 研究方法包括基于双语（韩语/英语）语音和文本产品测试的定性观察，以及使用自然语言声明提示（NLD-P）进行反思性起草。

Result: 研究识别了五种常见特征（冗余清晰度、指令性语法、受控词汇、扁平化韵律和单一意图结构），这些特征提高了执行准确性但压缩了表达范围。

Conclusion: 结论强调了MFE发展中沟通效率与语言丰富性之间的张力，并提出了对话界面设计和多语言用户教学方面的挑战，同时呼吁未来进行更多实证验证。

Abstract: Machine-Facing English (MFE) is an emergent register shaped by the adaptation
of everyday language to the expanding presence of AI interlocutors. Drawing on
register theory (Halliday 1985, 2006), enregisterment (Agha 2003), audience
design (Bell 1984), and interactional pragmatics (Giles & Ogay 2007), this
study traces how sustained human-AI interaction normalizes syntactic rigidity,
pragmatic simplification, and hyper-explicit phrasing - features that enhance
machine parseability at the expense of natural fluency. Our analysis is
grounded in qualitative observations from bilingual (Korean/English) voice- and
text-based product testing sessions, with reflexive drafting conducted using
Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) under human curation. Thematic
analysis identifies five recurrent traits - redundant clarity, directive
syntax, controlled vocabulary, flattened prosody, and single-intent structuring
- that improve execution accuracy but compress expressive range. MFE's
evolution highlights a persistent tension between communicative efficiency and
linguistic richness, raising design challenges for conversational interfaces
and pedagogical considerations for multilingual users. We conclude by
underscoring the need for comprehensive methodological exposition and future
empirical validation.

Conclusion: CAT-G方法有效解决了社交媒体评论的多样性问题，多语言测试集为不同语言性能比较提供了基础。

Abstract: The inherent nature of social media posts, characterized by the freedom of
language use with a disjointed array of diverse opinions and topics, poses
significant challenges to downstream NLP tasks such as comment clustering,
comment summarization, and social media opinion analysis. To address this, we
propose a granular level of identifying and generating aspect terms from
individual comments to guide model attention. Specifically, we leverage
multilingual large language models with supervised fine-tuning for comment
aspect term generation (CAT-G), further aligning the model's predictions with
human expectations through DPO. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing the comprehension of social media discourse on two NLP tasks.
Moreover, this paper contributes the first multilingual CAT-G test set on
English, Chinese, Malay, and Bahasa Indonesian. As LLM capabilities vary among
languages, this test set allows for a comparative analysis of performance
across languages with varying levels of LLM proficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ICL-based NER方法依赖大参数LLM的问题，如高计算资源、API成本和数据隐私问题。

Method: 1. 任务分解管道；2. 基于span级句子相似性的ICL演示检索；3. 自验证机制减少噪声。

Result: EL4NER在多个数据集上优于大参数LLM方法，某些数据集达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: EL4NER展示了小参数LLM在ICL范式中的高效性和可行性。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) technique based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained prominence in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for its lower
computing resource consumption, less manual labeling overhead, and stronger
generalizability. Nevertheless, most ICL-based NER methods depend on
large-parameter LLMs: the open-source models demand substantial computational
resources for deployment and inference, while the closed-source ones incur high
API costs, raise data-privacy concerns, and hinder community collaboration. To
address this question, we propose an Ensemble Learning Method for Named Entity
Recognition (EL4NER), which aims at aggregating the ICL outputs of multiple
open-source, small-parameter LLMs to enhance overall performance in NER tasks
at less deployment and inference cost. Specifically, our method comprises three
key components. First, we design a task decomposition-based pipeline that
facilitates deep, multi-stage ensemble learning. Second, we introduce a novel
span-level sentence similarity algorithm to establish an ICL demonstration
retrieval mechanism better suited for NER tasks. Third, we incorporate a
self-validation mechanism to mitigate the noise introduced during the ensemble
process. We evaluated EL4NER on multiple widely adopted NER datasets from
diverse domains. Our experimental results indicate that EL4NER surpasses most
closed-source, large-parameter LLM-based methods at a lower parameter cost and
even attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among ICL-based methods on
certain datasets. These results show the parameter efficiency of EL4NER and
underscore the feasibility of employing open-source, small-parameter LLMs
within the ICL paradigm for NER tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路由方法在RAG场景中表现不佳，因为它们依赖静态知识表示，而检索文档会动态影响LLM的能力。

Method: 提出RAGRouter，利用文档嵌入和RAG能力嵌入，通过对比学习捕捉知识表示变化，实现智能路由。

Result: RAGRouter在多样化任务中平均优于最佳单一LLM 3.61%，优于现有路由方法3.29%-9.33%。

Conclusion: RAGRouter通过动态路由设计，显著提升了RAG场景下的性能与效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly improves the performance
of Large Language Models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, varying
response quality across LLMs under RAG necessitates intelligent routing
mechanisms, which select the most suitable model for each query from multiple
retrieval-augmented LLMs via a dedicated router model. We observe that external
documents dynamically affect LLMs' ability to answer queries, while existing
routing methods, which rely on static parametric knowledge representations,
exhibit suboptimal performance in RAG scenarios. To address this, we formally
define the new retrieval-augmented LLM routing problem, incorporating the
influence of retrieved documents into the routing framework. We propose
RAGRouter, a RAG-aware routing design, which leverages document embeddings and
RAG capability embeddings with contrastive learning to capture knowledge
representation shifts and enable informed routing decisions. Extensive
experiments on diverse knowledge-intensive tasks and retrieval settings show
that RAGRouter outperforms the best individual LLM by 3.61% on average and
existing routing methods by 3.29%-9.33%. With an extended score-threshold-based
mechanism, it also achieves strong performance-efficiency trade-offs under
low-latency constraints.

Motivation: 探索小型语言模型是否具备通过自我反思有效修正输出的能力。

Method: 提出CoCoS方法，采用在线强化学习目标，设计累积奖励函数和细粒度奖励机制。

Result: 在1B规模模型上，CoCoS在MBPP和HumanEval上分别提升35.8%和27.7%。

Conclusion: CoCoS有效提升了小型语言模型的多轮代码修正能力。

Abstract: Self-correction has demonstrated potential in code generation by allowing
language models to revise and improve their outputs through successive
refinement. Recent studies have explored prompting-based strategies that
incorporate verification or feedback loops using proprietary models, as well as
training-based methods that leverage their strong reasoning capabilities.
However, whether smaller models possess the capacity to effectively guide their
outputs through self-reflection remains unexplored. Our findings reveal that
smaller models struggle to exhibit reflective revision behavior across both
self-correction paradigms. In response, we introduce CoCoS, an approach
designed to enhance the ability of small language models for multi-turn code
correction. Specifically, we propose an online reinforcement learning objective
that trains the model to confidently maintain correct outputs while
progressively correcting incorrect outputs as turns proceed. Our approach
features an accumulated reward function that aggregates rewards across the
entire trajectory and a fine-grained reward better suited to multi-turn
correction scenarios. This facilitates the model in enhancing initial response
quality while achieving substantial improvements through self-correction. With
1B-scale models, CoCoS achieves improvements of 35.8% on the MBPP and 27.7% on
HumanEval compared to the baselines.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of visual and textual content in Social
Networking Services (SNS), evaluating the multimodal capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing user experience, content
understanding, and platform intelligence. Existing benchmarks primarily focus
on text-centric tasks, lacking coverage of the multimodal contexts prevalent in
modern SNS ecosystems. In this paper, we introduce SNS-Bench-VL, a
comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to assess the performance of
Vision-Language LLMs in real-world social media scenarios. SNS-Bench-VL
incorporates images and text across 8 multimodal tasks, including note
comprehension, user engagement analysis, information retrieval, and
personalized recommendation. It comprises 4,001 carefully curated multimodal
question-answer pairs, covering single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended
tasks. We evaluate over 25 state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, analyzing their
performance across tasks. Our findings highlight persistent challenges in
multimodal social context comprehension. We hope SNS-Bench-VL will inspire
future research towards robust, context-aware, and human-aligned multimodal
intelligence for next-generation social networking services.

Method: 提出MBR-OT方法，利用Wasserstein距离结合句子级效用函数计算文档级效用。

Result: 实验表明，MBR-OT在文档级机器翻译、文本简化和密集图像描述任务中优于标准MBR。

Conclusion: MBR-OT通过改进效用计算方式，显著提升了文档级文本生成任务的性能。

Abstract: Document-level text generation tasks are known to be more difficult than
sentence-level text generation tasks as they require the understanding of
longer context to generate high-quality texts. In this paper, we investigate
the adaption of Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding for document-level text
generation tasks. MBR decoding makes use of a utility function to estimate the
output with the highest expected utility from a set of candidate outputs.
Although MBR decoding is shown to be effective in a wide range of
sentence-level text generation tasks, its performance on document-level text
generation tasks is limited as many of the utility functions are designed for
evaluating the utility of sentences. To this end, we propose MBR-OT, a variant
of MBR decoding using Wasserstein distance to compute the utility of a document
using a sentence-level utility function. The experimental result shows that the
performance of MBR-OT outperforms that of the standard MBR in document-level
machine translation, text simplification, and dense image captioning tasks. Our

*Zexuan Li,Hongliang Dai,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了如何利用大语言模型（LLMs）生成多样且正确的关系抽取（RE）训练数据，提出了两种方法：通过上下文学习（ICL）提示直接生成多样化样本，以及通过直接偏好优化（DPO）微调LLMs。实验表明，这两种方法均能提升生成数据的质量，且使用生成数据训练的非LLM模型性能优于直接使用LLM进行RE任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接使用LLMs生成的关系抽取训练样本结构相似度高，表达方式单一，限制了数据的多样性。因此，研究如何提升生成样本的多样性同时保持其正确性具有重要意义。

Method: 1. 通过上下文学习（ICL）提示直接生成多样化样本；2. 通过直接偏好优化（DPO）微调LLMs以生成多样化样本。

Result: 实验表明，两种方法均能提升生成数据的质量。此外，使用生成数据训练的非LLM模型在关系抽取任务中表现优于直接使用LLM。

Conclusion: 通过改进LLMs生成训练数据的多样性，可以有效提升关系抽取任务的性能，且非LLM模型在生成数据上的表现更优。

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate training data can potentially
be a preferable way to improve zero or few-shot NLP tasks. However, many
problems remain to be investigated for this direction. For the task of Relation
Extraction (RE), we find that samples generated by directly prompting LLMs may
easily have high structural similarities with each other. They tend to use a
limited variety of phrasing while expressing the relation between a pair of
entities. Therefore, in this paper, we study how to effectively improve the
diversity of the training samples generated with LLMs for RE, while also
maintaining their correctness. We first try to make the LLMs produce dissimilar
samples by directly giving instructions in In-Context Learning (ICL) prompts.
Then, we propose an approach to fine-tune LLMs for diversity training sample
generation through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our experiments on
commonly used RE datasets show that both attempts can improve the quality of
the generated training data. We also find that comparing with directly
performing RE with an LLM, training a non-LLM RE model with its generated
samples may lead to better performance.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Alignment Data Map的工具，利用GPT-4o分析偏好数据，通过计算对齐分数并构建数据地图，显著提高了数据收集效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集人类偏好数据成本高且效率低，限制了大规模语言模型（LLM）与人类价值观对齐的可扩展性。

Method: 使用GPT-4o作为LLM对齐的代理，计算LLM生成响应的对齐分数，并基于均值和方差构建Alignment Data Map。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用33%的高均值、低方差区域数据，性能可媲美或优于使用完整数据集。

Conclusion: Alignment Data Map能高效识别高质量样本，无需显式标注，并可诊断现有偏好数据集中的低效或错误样本。

Abstract: Human preference data plays a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human values. However, collecting such data is often expensive and
inefficient, posing a significant scalability challenge. To address this, we
introduce Alignment Data Map, a GPT-4o-assisted tool for analyzing and
diagnosing preference data. Using GPT-4o as a proxy for LLM alignment, we
compute alignment scores for LLM-generated responses to instructions from
existing preference datasets. These scores are then used to construct an
Alignment Data Map based on their mean and variance. Our experiments show that
using only 33 percent of the data, specifically samples in the high-mean,
low-variance region, achieves performance comparable to or better than using
the entire dataset. This finding suggests that the Alignment Data Map can
significantly improve data collection efficiency by identifying high-quality
samples for LLM alignment without requiring explicit annotations. Moreover, the
Alignment Data Map can diagnose existing preference datasets. Our analysis
shows that it effectively detects low-impact or potentially misannotated
samples. Source code is available online.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策依赖于多源证据的多模态推理，但现有模型在医学领域的应用不足。

Method: MedE²分为两阶段：第一阶段用2000个文本样本微调模型以激发推理行为；第二阶段用1500个多模态医学案例增强推理能力。

Result: 实验表明MedE²显著提升了模型在医学多模态任务中的性能，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MedE²方法在医学多模态推理中表现出高效性和实用性，适用于更大模型和推理扩展。

Abstract: Effective clinical decision-making depends on iterative, multimodal reasoning
across diverse sources of evidence. The recent emergence of multimodal
reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex
tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and
science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that
elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I,
we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely
orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In
Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500
rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs
with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in
improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably,
models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across
multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models
and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical
utility of our approach.

Result: ContextQFormer在TMDialog数据集上比基线模型性能提升2%-4%。

Conclusion: ContextQFormer和TMDialog数据集有效提升了多模态模型的多轮对话能力。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
abilities and powerful image-understanding capabilities. However, the existing
open-source multi-modal models suffer from the weak capability of multi-turn
interaction, especially for long contexts. To address the issue, we first
introduce a context modeling module, termed ContextQFormer, which utilizes a
memory block to enhance the presentation of contextual information.
Furthermore, to facilitate further research, we carefully build a new
multi-turn multi-modal dialogue dataset (TMDialog) for pre-training,
instruction-tuning, and evaluation, which will be open-sourced lately. Compared
with other multi-modal dialogue datasets, TMDialog contains longer
conversations, which supports the research of multi-turn multi-modal dialogue.
In addition, ContextQFormer is compared with three baselines on TMDialog and
experimental results illustrate that ContextQFormer achieves an improvement of
2%-4% in available rate over baselines.

Motivation: 验证LLMs在实用问题中的抽象推理能力是否足够通用，特别是历史语言学启发的归纳推理问题。

Method: 开发了一个自动化流水线，动态生成可控难度的基准测试集，以解决可扩展性和污染问题。

Result: 生成的测试集（近1k实例）对当前最先进的LLMs极具挑战性，最佳模型（Claude-3.7-Sonnet）仅达到54%通过率。

Conclusion: LCoT LLMs在历史语言学等领域的推理能力仍有不足。

Abstract: Recently, long chain of thought (LCoT), Large Language Models (LLMs), have
taken the machine learning world by storm with their breathtaking reasoning
capabilities. However, are the abstract reasoning abilities of these models
general enough for problems of practical importance? Unlike past work, which
has focused mainly on math, coding, and data wrangling, we focus on a
historical linguistics-inspired inductive reasoning problem, formulated as
Programming by Examples. We develop a fully automated pipeline for dynamically
generating a benchmark for this task with controllable difficulty in order to
tackle scalability and contamination issues to which many reasoning benchmarks
are subject. Using our pipeline, we generate a test set with nearly 1k
instances that is challenging for all state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, with the
best model (Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieving a mere 54% pass rate, demonstrating
that LCoT LLMs still struggle with a class or reasoning that is ubiquitous in
historical linguistics as well as many other domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在翻译上下文敏感单元（如多义词）时的挑战，避免因信息扁平化导致的误译或理解错误。

Method: 动态分析和识别翻译难点，以结构化方式将其融入LLMs，激活模型从海量数据中提取相关知识。

Result: 在多个语言对的基准测试中表现优异，超越现有开源基线模型，且资源消耗低。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练，能高效提升LLMs在机器翻译及其他NLP任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance across
multiple crosslingual NLP tasks, including machine translation (MT). However,
persistent challenges remain in addressing context-sensitive units (CSUs), such
as polysemous words. These CSUs not only affect the local translation accuracy
of LLMs, but also affect LLMs' understanding capability for sentences and
tasks, and even lead to translation failure. To address this problem, we
propose a simple but effective method to enhance LLMs' MT capabilities by
acquiring CSUs and applying semantic focus. Specifically, we dynamically
analyze and identify translation challenges, then incorporate them into LLMs in
a structured manner to mitigate mistranslations or misunderstandings of CSUs
caused by information flattening. Efficiently activate LLMs to identify and
apply relevant knowledge from its vast data pool in this way, ensuring more
accurate translations for translating difficult terms. On a benchmark dataset
of MT, our proposed method achieved competitive performance compared to
multiple existing open-sourced MT baseline models. It demonstrates
effectiveness and robustness across multiple language pairs, including both
similar language pairs and distant language pairs. Notably, the proposed method
requires no additional model training and enhances LLMs' performance across
multiple NLP tasks with minimal resource consumption.

Motivation: 传统双语词典诱导方法在专业领域表现较差，尤其是在数据量小且词频低的领域。静态词嵌入在上下文敏感的领域中可能导致较大偏差。

Method: 提出了一种基于预训练模型的方法，结合Code Switch技术，改进词嵌入以适应跨领域双语词典诱导任务。

Result: 在三个特定领域上，该方法比现有基线平均提升了0.78分。

Conclusion: 该方法在专业领域的双语词典诱导任务中表现更优，尤其是在数据稀缺和上下文敏感的领域。

Abstract: Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) is generally based on common domain data to
obtain monolingual word embedding, and by aligning the monolingual word
embeddings to obtain the cross-lingual embeddings which are used to get the
word translation pairs. In this paper, we propose a new task of BLI, which is
to use the monolingual corpus of the general domain and target domain to
extract domain-specific bilingual dictionaries. Motivated by the ability of
Pre-trained models, we propose a method to get better word embeddings that
build on the recent work on BLI. This way, we introduce the Code Switch(Qin et
al., 2020) firstly in the cross-domain BLI task, which can match differit is
yet to be seen whether these methods are suitable for bilingual lexicon
extraction in professional fields. As we can see in table 1, the classic and
efficient BLI approach, Muse and Vecmap, perform much worse on the Medical
dataset than on the Wiki dataset. On one hand, the specialized domain data set
is relatively smaller compared to the generic domain data set generally, and
specialized words have a lower frequency, which will directly affect the
translation quality of bilingual dictionaries. On the other hand, static word
embeddings are widely used for BLI, however, in some specific fields, the
meaning of words is greatly influenced by context, in this case, using only
static word embeddings may lead to greater bias. ent strategies in different
contexts, making the model more suitable for this task. Experimental results
show that our method can improve performances over robust BLI baselines on
three specific domains by averagely improving 0.78 points.

TLDR: Retell是一种针对文学文本的主题建模方法，通过生成语言模型将叙事内容转化为高层概念，再结合LDA，提高了主题建模的精确性和信息量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题建模方法（如LDA）在文学文本中表现不佳，因为文学语言注重感官细节而非抽象描述。Retell旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用生成语言模型将文学段落转化为高层概念，再对转化结果应用LDA进行主题建模。

Result: Retell生成的主题比单独使用LDA或直接让语言模型列出主题更精确、信息量更大。

Conclusion: Retell为文学文本的主题建模提供了一种有效方法，并在文化分析案例中验证了其潜力。

Abstract: Conventional bag-of-words approaches for topic modeling, like latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA), struggle with literary text. Literature challenges
lexical methods because narrative language focuses on immersive sensory details
instead of abstractive description or exposition: writers are advised to "show,
don't tell." We propose Retell, a simple, accessible topic modeling approach
for literature. Here, we prompt resource-efficient, generative language models
(LMs) to tell what passages show, thereby translating narratives' surface forms
into higher-level concepts and themes. By running LDA on LMs' retellings of
passages, we can obtain more precise and informative topics than by running LDA
alone or by directly asking LMs to list topics. To investigate the potential of
our method for cultural analytics, we compare our method's outputs to
expert-guided annotations in a case study on racial/cultural identity in high
school English language arts books.

ZIPA, including transducer (ZIPA-T) and CTC-based (ZIPA-CR) variants, leverage
the efficient Zipformer backbones and outperform existing phone recognition
systems with much fewer parameters. Further scaling via noisy student training
on 11,000 hours of pseudo-labeled multilingual data yields further improvement.
While ZIPA achieves strong performance on benchmarks, error analysis reveals

Motivation: 当前方法在提取复杂信息和推断数据方面存在不足，因此需要一种更有效的方法来生成可解释的表格。

Result: 在Rotowire和Livesum数据集上测试，Map&Make显著提升了性能，并减少了幻觉错误。

Conclusion: 该方法在结构化摘要任务中表现出色，并通过消融研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Transforming dense, detailed, unstructured text into an interpretable and
summarised table, also colloquially known as Text-to-Table generation, is an
essential task for information retrieval. Current methods, however, miss out on
how and what complex information to extract; they also lack the ability to
infer data from the text. In this paper, we introduce a versatile approach,
Map&Make, which "dissects" text into propositional atomic statements. This
facilitates granular decomposition to extract the latent schema. The schema is
then used to populate the tables that capture the qualitative nuances and the
quantitative facts in the original text. Our approach is tested against two
challenging datasets, Rotowire, renowned for its complex and multi-table
schema, and Livesum, which demands numerical aggregation. By carefully
identifying and correcting hallucination errors in Rotowire, we aim to achieve
a cleaner and more reliable benchmark. We evaluate our method rigorously on a
comprehensive suite of comparative and referenceless metrics. Our findings
demonstrate significant improvement results across both datasets with better
interpretability in Text-to-Table generation. Moreover, through detailed
ablation studies and analyses, we investigate the factors contributing to
superior performance and validate the practicality of our framework in
structured summarization tasks.

Conclusion: Infinite-Instruct 为编程领域的LLM训练提供了可扩展的解决方案，并开源了实验数据集。

Abstract: Traditional code instruction data synthesis methods suffer from limited
diversity and poor logic. We introduce Infinite-Instruct, an automated
framework for synthesizing high-quality question-answer pairs, designed to
enhance the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
framework focuses on improving the internal logic of synthesized problems and
the quality of synthesized code. First, "Reverse Construction" transforms code
snippets into diverse programming problems. Then, through "Backfeeding
Construction," keywords in programming problems are structured into a knowledge
graph to reconstruct them into programming problems with stronger internal
logic. Finally, a cross-lingual static code analysis pipeline filters invalid
samples to ensure data quality. Experiments show that on mainstream code
generation benchmarks, our fine-tuned models achieve an average performance
improvement of 21.70% on 7B-parameter models and 36.95% on 32B-parameter
models. Using less than one-tenth of the instruction fine-tuning data, we
achieved performance comparable to the Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct.
Infinite-Instruct provides a scalable solution for LLM training in programming.
We open-source the datasets used in the experiments, including both unfiltered
versions and filtered versions via static analysis. The data are available at

Result: 在14个指标和12种翻译方向的评估中，发现无监督指标的潜力、监督方法在标签不确定性下的不足，以及单标注者评估的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 无监督指标潜力巨大，监督方法在标签不确定时表现不佳，单标注者评估不可靠。

Abstract: Word-level quality estimation (WQE) aims to automatically identify
fine-grained error spans in machine-translated outputs and has found many uses,
including assisting translators during post-editing. Modern WQE techniques are
often expensive, involving prompting of large language models or ad-hoc
training on large amounts of human-labeled data. In this work, we investigate
efficient alternatives exploiting recent advances in language model
interpretability and uncertainty quantification to identify translation errors
from the inner workings of translation models. In our evaluation spanning 14
metrics across 12 translation directions, we quantify the impact of human label
variation on metric performance by using multiple sets of human labels. Our
results highlight the untapped potential of unsupervised metrics, the
shortcomings of supervised methods when faced with label uncertainty, and the
brittleness of single-annotator evaluation practices.

Abstract: Large Language Model-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown remarkable
progress in solving complex tasks through collaborative reasoning and
inter-agent critique. However, existing approaches typically treat each task in
isolation, resulting in redundant computations and limited generalization
across structurally similar tasks. To address this, we introduce multi-agent
cross-task experiential learning (MAEL), a novel framework that endows
LLM-driven agents with explicit cross-task learning and experience
accumulation. We model the task-solving workflow on a graph-structured
multi-agent collaboration network, where agents propagate information and
coordinate via explicit connectivity. During the experiential learning phase,
we quantify the quality for each step in the task-solving workflow and store
the resulting rewards along with the corresponding inputs and outputs into each
agent's individual experience pool. During inference, agents retrieve
high-reward, task-relevant experiences as few-shot examples to enhance the
effectiveness of each reasoning step, thereby enabling more accurate and
efficient multi-agent collaboration. Experimental results on diverse datasets
demonstrate that MAEL empowers agents to learn from prior task experiences
effectively-achieving faster convergence and producing higher-quality solutions
on current tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies provide large language models (LLMs) with textual task-solving
experiences via prompts to improve their performance. However, previous methods
rely on substantial human labor or time to gather such experiences for each
task, which is impractical given the growing variety of task types in user
queries to LLMs. To address this issue, we design an autonomous experience
transfer framework to explore whether LLMs can mimic human cognitive
intelligence to autonomously transfer experience from existing source tasks to
newly encountered target tasks. This not only allows the acquisition of
experience without extensive costs of previous methods, but also offers a novel
path for the generalization of LLMs. Experimental results on 13 datasets
demonstrate that our framework effectively improves the performance of LLMs.
Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of each module in the framework.

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
significant progress but continue to face inherent challenges in multimodal
reasoning, which requires multi-level (e.g., perception, reasoning) and
multi-granular (e.g., multi-step reasoning chain) advanced inferencing. Prior
work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for
training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning
step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we
present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary
awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve
this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal
self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM
reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of
self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression
warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward
functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at
each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical
results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across
diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in
multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task
performance.

*Hao Lu,Yanchi Gu,Haoyuan Huang,Yulin Zhou,Ningxin Zhu,Chen Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出MCTSr-Zero框架，将蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）与大型语言模型（LLMs）结合，用于开放对话任务（如心理咨询），通过领域对齐和探索机制改进生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCTS方法在开放对话任务中因缺乏明确正确性标准而表现不佳，需改进以符合主观需求（如共情、伦理）。

Method: 提出MCTSr-Zero框架，引入领域对齐、再生和元提示适应机制，优化对话轨迹生成。

Result: 实验表明，生成的对话数据（用于微调PsyLLM）在PsyEval基准上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MCTSr-Zero有效解决了开放对话任务中的对齐问题，为LLMs在复杂领域（如心理咨询）的应用提供了高质量数据。

Abstract: The integration of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated significant success in structured, problem-oriented
tasks. However, applying these methods to open-ended dialogues, such as those
in psychological counseling, presents unique challenges. Unlike tasks with
objective correctness, success in therapeutic conversations depends on
subjective factors like empathetic engagement, ethical adherence, and alignment
with human preferences, for which strict "correctness" criteria are
ill-defined. Existing result-oriented MCTS approaches can therefore produce
misaligned responses. To address this, we introduce MCTSr-Zero, an MCTS
framework designed for open-ended, human-centric dialogues. Its core innovation
is "domain alignment", which shifts the MCTS search objective from predefined
end-states towards conversational trajectories that conform to target domain
principles (e.g., empathy in counseling). Furthermore, MCTSr-Zero incorporates
"Regeneration" and "Meta-Prompt Adaptation" mechanisms to substantially broaden
exploration by allowing the MCTS to consider fundamentally different initial
dialogue strategies. We evaluate MCTSr-Zero in psychological counseling by
generating multi-turn dialogue data, which is used to fine-tune an LLM, PsyLLM.
We also introduce PsyEval, a benchmark for assessing multi-turn psychological
counseling dialogues. Experiments demonstrate that PsyLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on PsyEval and other relevant metrics, validating
MCTSr-Zero's effectiveness in generating high-quality, principle-aligned
conversational data for human-centric domains and addressing the LLM challenge
of consistently adhering to complex psychological standards.

TLDR: ChartMind是一个新的复杂图表问答（CQA）基准，支持多语言和开放域输出，提出了模型无关的框架ChartLLM，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CQA评估过于依赖刚性输出格式和客观指标，忽视了实际图表分析的复杂需求。

Method: 提出ChartMind基准和ChartLLM框架，专注于提取上下文关键元素并减少噪声。

Result: 在ChartMind和三个公共基准上，ChartLLM显著优于现有三种CQA范式。

Conclusion: 研究为未来开发更鲁棒的图表推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Chart question answering (CQA) has become a critical multimodal task for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. While early
approaches have shown promising performance by focusing on visual features or
leveraging large-scale pre-training, most existing evaluations rely on rigid
output formats and objective metrics, thus ignoring the complex, real-world
demands of practical chart analysis. In this paper, we introduce ChartMind, a
new benchmark designed for complex CQA tasks in real-world settings. ChartMind
covers seven task categories, incorporates multilingual contexts, supports
open-domain textual outputs, and accommodates diverse chart formats, bridging
the gap between real-world applications and traditional academic benchmarks.
Furthermore, we propose a context-aware yet model-agnostic framework, ChartLLM,
that focuses on extracting key contextual elements, reducing noise, and
enhancing the reasoning accuracy of multimodal large language models. Extensive
evaluations on ChartMind and three representative public benchmarks with 14
mainstream multimodal models show our framework significantly outperforms the
previous three common CQA paradigms: instruction-following, OCR-enhanced, and
chain-of-thought, highlighting the importance of flexible chart understanding
for real-world CQA. These findings suggest new directions for developing more
robust chart reasoning in future research.

Abstract: Approaches form the foundation for conducting scientific research. Querying
approaches from a vast body of scientific papers is extremely time-consuming,
and without a well-organized management framework, researchers may face
significant challenges in querying and utilizing relevant approaches.
Constructing multiple dimensions on approaches and managing them from these
dimensions can provide an efficient solution. Firstly, this paper identifies
approach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four
distinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,
and lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on
approach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches
are identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure
to represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a
tree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level
similarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the
similarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to
construct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging
each approach component or class with its most similar approach component or
class in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering
process indicate the common semantics of the step components within the
approach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within
the class. The class trees of the five dimensions collectively form a
multi-dimensional approach space. The application of approach queries on the
multi-dimensional approach space demonstrates that querying within this space
ensures strong relevance between user queries and results and rapidly reduces
search space through a class-based query mechanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成人类似文本方面表现出色，但对信息完整性构成挑战，尤其是在阿拉伯语等低资源语言中。

Method: 研究采用多种生成策略（如标题生成、内容感知生成和文本优化）和模型架构（ALLaM、Jais、Llama、GPT-4），结合风格计量学分析。

Result: 研究发现机器生成的阿拉伯语文本具有可检测的特征，并开发了BERT检测模型，在正式语境中达到99.9%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发针对阿拉伯语的鲁棒检测系统奠定了基础，有助于维护信息完整性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented capabilities in
generating human-like text, posing subtle yet significant challenges for
information integrity across critical domains, including education, social
media, and academia, enabling sophisticated misinformation campaigns,
compromising healthcare guidance, and facilitating targeted propaganda. This
challenge becomes severe, particularly in under-explored and low-resource
languages like Arabic. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of
Arabic machine-generated text, examining multiple generation strategies
(generation from the title only, content-aware generation, and text refinement)
across diverse model architectures (ALLaM, Jais, Llama, and GPT-4) in academic,
and social media domains. Our stylometric analysis reveals distinctive
linguistic patterns differentiating human-written from machine-generated Arabic
text across these varied contexts. Despite their human-like qualities, we
demonstrate that LLMs produce detectable signatures in their Arabic outputs,
with domain-specific characteristics that vary significantly between different
contexts. Based on these insights, we developed BERT-based detection models
that achieved exceptional performance in formal contexts (up to 99.9\%
F1-score) with strong precision across model architectures. Our cross-domain
analysis confirms generalization challenges previously reported in the
literature. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most
comprehensive investigation of Arabic machine-generated text to date, uniquely
combining multiple prompt generation methods, diverse model architectures, and
in-depth stylometric analysis across varied textual domains, establishing a
foundation for developing robust, linguistically-informed detection systems
essential for preserving information integrity in Arabic-language contexts.

*Yong Zhang,Yanwen Huang,Ning Cheng,Yang Guo,Yun Zhu,Yanmeng Wang,Shaojun Wang,Jing Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: Sentinel提出了一种轻量级的句子级压缩框架，通过注意力机制筛选相关句子，无需训练专用压缩模型，在保持性能的同时实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法中，检索到的段落通常冗长、噪声多或超出输入限制，而传统压缩方法需训练专用模型，成本高且可移植性差。

Method: Sentinel利用现成的0.5B代理LLM的解码器注意力信号，通过轻量级分类器识别句子相关性，实现上下文过滤。

Result: 在LongBench基准测试中，Sentinel实现了5倍压缩，同时性能与7B规模的压缩系统相当。

Conclusion: 通过探测原生注意力信号，Sentinel提供了一种快速、有效且问题感知的上下文压缩方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external context, but retrieved passages are often lengthy, noisy, or
exceed input limits. Existing compression methods typically require supervised
training of dedicated compression models, increasing cost and reducing
portability. We propose Sentinel, a lightweight sentence-level compression
framework that reframes context filtering as an attention-based understanding
task. Rather than training a compression model, Sentinel probes decoder
attention from an off-the-shelf 0.5B proxy LLM using a lightweight classifier
to identify sentence relevance. Empirically, we find that query-context
relevance estimation is consistent across model scales, with 0.5B proxies
closely matching the behaviors of larger models. On the LongBench benchmark,
Sentinel achieves up to 5$\times$ compression while matching the QA performance
of 7B-scale compression systems. Our results suggest that probing native
attention signals enables fast, effective, and question-aware context
compression. Code available at: https://github.com/yzhangchuck/Sentinel.

Motivation: 当前知识编辑任务过于简单，缺乏与实际应用场景的结合，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 引入基于脚本的基准ScEdit，结合反事实和时间编辑，采用标记级和文本级评估方法。

Result: 所有知识编辑方法在性能上均有所下降，文本级评估更具挑战性。

Conclusion: ScEdit为知识编辑提供了更全面的评估框架，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) has gained increasing attention, yet current KE tasks
remain relatively simple. Under current evaluation frameworks, many editing
methods achieve exceptionally high scores, sometimes nearing perfection.
However, few studies integrate KE into real-world application scenarios (e.g.,
recent interest in LLM-as-agent). To support our analysis, we introduce a novel
script-based benchmark -- ScEdit (Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark) --
which encompasses both counterfactual and temporal edits. We integrate
token-level and text-level evaluation methods, comprehensively analyzing
existing KE techniques. The benchmark extends traditional fact-based
("What"-type question) evaluation to action-based ("How"-type question)
evaluation. We observe that all KE methods exhibit a drop in performance on
established metrics and face challenges on text-level metrics, indicating a
challenging task. Our benchmark is available at

TLDR: 研究发现，大语言模型（LLMs）生成的文本越长，事实准确性越低，主要原因是知识耗尽而非其他假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs生成文本长度与事实准确性之间的关系，以提升其可靠性。

Method: 引入自动双层长文本事实性评估框架，并进行控制实验验证假设。

Result: 长文本的事实精确性较低，主要原因是知识耗尽。

Conclusion: 知识耗尽是导致长文本事实性下降的主要原因，需进一步优化模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for long-form text generation.
However, factual errors in the responses would undermine their reliability.
Despite growing attention to LLM factuality, the effect of response length on
factuality remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate
this relationship by first introducing an automatic and bi-level long-form
factuality evaluation framework, which achieves high agreement with human
annotations while being cost-effective. Using this framework, we conduct
controlled experiments and find that longer responses exhibit lower factual
precision, confirming the presence of length bias. To explain this phenomenon,
we empirically examine three hypotheses: error propagation, long context, and
facts exhaustion. Our results reveal that facts exhaustion, where the model
gradually exhausts more reliable knowledge, is the primary cause of factual
degradation, rather than the other two hypotheses.

Conclusion: EmoBench-UA为乌克兰语情感分类提供了基准，并呼吁更多资源支持非主流语言的NLP研究。

Abstract: While Ukrainian NLP has seen progress in many texts processing tasks, emotion
classification remains an underexplored area with no publicly available
benchmark to date. In this work, we introduce EmoBench-UA, the first annotated
dataset for emotion detection in Ukrainian texts. Our annotation schema is
adapted from the previous English-centric works on emotion detection (Mohammad
et al., 2018; Mohammad, 2022) guidelines. The dataset was created through
crowdsourcing using the Toloka.ai platform ensuring high-quality of the
annotation process. Then, we evaluate a range of approaches on the collected
dataset, starting from linguistic-based baselines, synthetic data translated
from English, to large language models (LLMs). Our findings highlight the
challenges of emotion classification in non-mainstream languages like Ukrainian
and emphasize the need for further development of Ukrainian-specific models and
training resources.

Result: 在标准问答RAG基准测试中，仅需250个训练样本即可达到与强基线相当的性能。

Conclusion: 轻量级、数据高效的方法在工业部署中具有潜力，尤其是在标注受限的场景下。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
are increasingly deployed in industry applications, yet their reliability
remains hampered by challenges in detecting hallucinations. While supervised
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that leverage LLM hidden states -- such as
activation tracing and representation analysis -- show promise, their
dependence on extensively annotated datasets limits scalability in real-world
applications. This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of data annotation
by investigating the feasibility of reducing training data requirements for two
SOTA hallucination detection frameworks: Lookback Lens, which analyzes
attention head dynamics, and probing-based approaches, which decode internal
model representations. We propose a methodology combining efficient
classification algorithms with dimensionality reduction techniques to minimize
sample size demands while maintaining competitive performance. Evaluations on
standardized question-answering RAG benchmarks show that our approach achieves
performance comparable to strong proprietary LLM-based baselines with only 250
training samples. These results highlight the potential of lightweight,
data-efficient paradigms for industrial deployment, particularly in
annotation-constrained scenarios.

Result: 在EC-GCD基准测试中，PaMA性能提升达12.58%，且在新构建的Scam Report数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: PaMA有效解决了EC-GCD的挑战，并在性能上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify both known and novel
categories using partially labeled data that contains only known classes.
Despite achieving strong performance on existing benchmarks, current textual
GCD methods lack sufficient validation in realistic settings. We introduce
Event-Centric GCD (EC-GCD), characterized by long, complex narratives and
highly imbalanced class distributions, posing two main challenges: (1)
divergent clustering versus classification groupings caused by subjective
criteria, and (2) Unfair alignment for minority classes. To tackle these, we
propose PaMA, a framework leveraging LLMs to extract and refine event patterns
for improved cluster-class alignment. Additionally, a ranking-filtering-mining
pipeline ensures balanced representation of prototypes across imbalanced
categories. Evaluations on two EC-GCD benchmarks, including a newly constructed
Scam Report dataset, demonstrate that PaMA outperforms prior methods with up to
12.58% H-score gains, while maintaining strong generalization on base GCD
datasets.

Result: 最佳模型F1分数为0.97，47%的评分达到100% CEFR一致性，99%达到至少95%一致性。

Conclusion: 置信度建模显著提升了AES评分的可靠性，优于传统方法。

Abstract: A key ethical challenge in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is ensuring that
scores are only released when they meet high reliability standards. Confidence
modelling addresses this by assigning a reliability estimate measure, in the
form of a confidence score, to each automated score. In this study, we frame
confidence estimation as a classification task: predicting whether an
AES-generated score correctly places a candidate in the appropriate CEFR level.
While this is a binary decision, we leverage the inherent granularity of the
scoring domain in two ways. First, we reformulate the task as an n-ary
classification problem using score binning. Second, we introduce a set of novel
Kernel Weighted Ordinal Categorical Cross Entropy (KWOCCE) loss functions that
incorporate the ordinal structure of CEFR labels. Our best-performing model
achieves an F1 score of 0.97, and enables the system to release 47% of scores
with 100% CEFR agreement and 99% with at least 95% CEFR agreement -compared to
approximately 92% (approx.) CEFR agreement from the standalone AES model where
we release all AM predicted scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接对齐方法（如DPO）在优化大语言模型时，虽然能匹配相对偏好，但会降低响应似然，导致模型输出偏离预期模式。本文旨在解决这一似然不确定性问题。

Method: 重新分解DPO的损失函数，发现其隐含简化了正则化器。提出PRO方法，通过完整正则化器的近似，统一处理多种反馈类型。

Result: PRO在成对、二元和标量反馈场景中均优于现有方法，有效解决了似然不确定性问题。

Conclusion: PRO通过理论分析和实验验证，为直接对齐方法提供了更优的解决方案，扩展了其适用性。

Abstract: Direct alignment methods typically optimize large language models (LLMs) by
contrasting the likelihoods of preferred versus dispreferred responses. While
effective in steering LLMs to match relative preference, these methods are
frequently noted for decreasing the absolute likelihoods of example responses.
As a result, aligned models tend to generate outputs that deviate from the
expected patterns, exhibiting reward-hacking effect even without a reward
model. This undesired consequence exposes a fundamental limitation in
contrastive alignment, which we characterize as likelihood underdetermination.
In this work, we revisit direct preference optimization (DPO) -- the seminal
direct alignment method -- and demonstrate that its loss theoretically admits a
decomposed reformulation. The reformulated loss not only broadens applicability
to a wider range of feedback types, but also provides novel insights into the
underlying cause of likelihood underdetermination. Specifically, the standard
DPO implementation implicitly oversimplifies a regularizer in the reformulated
loss, and reinstating its complete version effectively resolves the
underdetermination issue. Leveraging these findings, we introduce PRoximalized
PReference Optimization (PRO), a unified method to align with diverse feeback
types, eliminating likelihood underdetermination through an efficient
approximation of the complete regularizer. Comprehensive experiments show the
superiority of PRO over existing methods in scenarios involving pairwise,
binary and scalar feedback.

Motivation: 澄清对LLM能力的极端观点，提出更现实的“上下文导向外推”机制。

Method: 通过文献支持，分析LLMs如何从训练数据中提取信息并进行外推。

Result: LLMs的能力可预测且可控，不具人类高级认知能力，但超越随机模仿。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注上下文导向外推及其与训练数据的交互，而非依赖LLMs的固有高级推理能力。

Abstract: In this position paper we raise critical awareness of a realistic view of LLM
capabilities that eschews extreme alternative views that LLMs are either
"stochastic parrots" or in possession of "emergent" advanced reasoning
capabilities, which, due to their unpredictable emergence, constitute an
existential threat. Our middle-ground view is that LLMs extrapolate from priors
from their training data, and that a mechanism akin to in-context learning
enables the targeting of the appropriate information from which to extrapolate.
We call this "context-directed extrapolation." Under this view, substantiated
though existing literature, while reasoning capabilities go well beyond
stochastic parroting, such capabilities are predictable, controllable, not
indicative of advanced reasoning akin to high-level cognitive capabilities in
humans, and not infinitely scalable with additional training. As a result,
fears of uncontrollable emergence of agency are allayed, while research
advances are appropriately refocused on the processes of context-directed
extrapolation and how this interacts with training data to produce valuable
capabilities in LLMs. Future work can therefore explore alternative augmenting
techniques that do not rely on inherent advanced reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 过程奖励模型（PRMs）比结果奖励模型（ORMs）提供更细致的监督，但现有方法因生成与奖励建模的冲突导致不稳定和不准确的信用分配。

Method: 提出Q-RM，通过优化判别策略（Q函数）从偏好数据中学习token级奖励，避免依赖细粒度标注。

Result: Q-RM在多个基准测试中表现优于基线方法，数学推理任务中Pass@1分数显著提升，训练效率提高10倍以上。

Conclusion: Q-RM为复杂推理任务提供了一种高效且稳定的奖励建模方法，未来可进一步扩展其应用。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) provide more nuanced supervision compared to
outcome reward models (ORMs) for optimizing policy models, positioning them as
a promising approach to enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in complex reasoning
tasks. Recent efforts have advanced PRMs from step-level to token-level
granularity by integrating reward modeling into the training of generative
models, with reward scores derived from token generation probabilities.
However, the conflict between generative language modeling and reward modeling
may introduce instability and lead to inaccurate credit assignments. To address
this challenge, we revisit token-level reward assignment by decoupling reward
modeling from language generation and derive a token-level reward model through
the optimization of a discriminative policy, termed the Q-function Reward Model
(Q-RM). We theoretically demonstrate that Q-RM explicitly learns token-level
Q-functions from preference data without relying on fine-grained annotations.
In our experiments, Q-RM consistently outperforms all baseline methods across
various benchmarks. For example, when integrated into PPO/REINFORCE algorithms,
Q-RM enhances the average Pass@1 score by 5.85/4.70 points on mathematical
reasoning tasks compared to the ORM baseline, and by 4.56/5.73 points compared
to the token-level PRM counterpart. Moreover, reinforcement learning with Q-RM
significantly enhances training efficiency, achieving convergence 12 times
faster than ORM on GSM8K and 11 times faster than step-level PRM on MATH. Code

annotators label the same data instance. Prior work has shown that
LLM-generated explanations can help align model predictions with human label
distributions, but typically adopt a reverse paradigm: producing explanations
based on given answers. In contrast, CoTs provide a forward reasoning path that
may implicitly embed rationales for each answer option, before generating the
answers. We thus propose a novel LLM-based pipeline enriched with
linguistically-grounded discourse segmenters to extract supporting and opposing
statements for each answer option from CoTs with improved accuracy. We also
propose a rank-based HLV evaluation framework that prioritizes the ranking of
answers over exact scores, which instead favor direct comparison of label
distributions. Our method outperforms a direct generation method as well as
baselines on three datasets, and shows better alignment of ranking methods with
humans, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）的自适应越狱策略，根据模型的语义理解能力将其分类并设计针对性攻击方法，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决LLM内置安全约束被越狱攻击绕过的关键安全问题，这些攻击通过利用模型理解能力的弱点威胁其可靠性。

Method: 方法包括将LLM分为Type I和Type II两类，根据其语义理解能力设计定制化越狱策略，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验结果显示，自适应策略显著提升了越狱成功率，特别是在GPT-4o（2025年5月29日发布）上达到了98.9%的成功率。

Conclusion: 结论表明，基于语义理解能力的自适应越狱策略是一种高效攻击方法，突显了LLM安全性的脆弱性。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) via jailbreaking
techniques-methods that circumvent their built-in safety and ethical
constraints-have emerged as a critical challenge in AI security. These attacks
compromise the reliability of LLMs by exploiting inherent weaknesses in their
comprehension capabilities. This paper investigates the efficacy of
jailbreaking strategies that are specifically adapted to the diverse levels of
understanding exhibited by different LLMs. We propose the Adaptive Jailbreaking
Strategies Based on the Semantic Understanding Capabilities of Large Language
Models, a novel framework that classifies LLMs into Type I and Type II
categories according to their semantic comprehension abilities. For each
category, we design tailored jailbreaking strategies aimed at leveraging their
vulnerabilities to facilitate successful attacks. Extensive experiments
conducted on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our adaptive strategy markedly
improves the success rate of jailbreaking. Notably, our approach achieves an
exceptional 98.9% success rate in jailbreaking GPT-4o(29 May 2025 release)

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究探讨了微调数据对大型语言模型事实性的影响，发现推理阶段的提示可以弥补微调数据的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解微调数据对模型事实性影响的机制，并探索如何通过推理阶段的方法（如ICL）弥补其不足。

Method: 通过系统实验分析微调数据对事实性的影响，特别关注已知与未知知识之间的差距，并从知识图谱角度进行理论证明。

Result: 推理阶段的提示（如OOD设置或ICL）可以显著减少事实性差距，甚至主导知识提取过程。

Conclusion: ICL能有效弥补微调数据的不足，需重新评估ICL提示在微调数据选择方法中的作用。

Abstract: Factual knowledge extraction aims to explicitly extract knowledge
parameterized in pre-trained language models for application in downstream
tasks. While prior work has been investigating the impact of supervised
fine-tuning data on the factuality of large language models (LLMs), its
mechanism remains poorly understood. We revisit this impact through systematic
experiments, with a particular focus on the factuality gap that arises when
fine-tuning on known versus unknown knowledge. Our findings show that this gap
can be mitigated at the inference stage, either under out-of-distribution (OOD)
settings or by using appropriate in-context learning (ICL) prompts (i.e.,
few-shot learning and Chain of Thought (CoT)). We prove this phenomenon
theoretically from the perspective of knowledge graphs, showing that the
test-time prompt may diminish or even overshadow the impact of fine-tuning data
and play a dominant role in knowledge extraction. Ultimately, our results shed
light on the interaction between finetuning data and test-time prompt,
demonstrating that ICL can effectively compensate for shortcomings in
fine-tuning data, and highlighting the need to reconsider the use of ICL
prompting as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning data
selection methods.

TLDR: 本文研究了大规模语音到文本（S2T）训练中的学习率（LR）预热策略，发现子指数LR预热更适合此类训练，高LR能加速初始收敛但不提升最终性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模S2T训练中，传统LR调整方法不足，需研究更优的预热策略及其对性能的影响。

Method: 比较不同LR预热策略，包括双线性预热和子指数预热，分析其对训练收敛和最终性能的影响。

Result: 子指数LR预热更适合大规模S2T训练；高LR加速初始收敛，但不改善最终性能。

Conclusion: 大规模S2T训练应采用子指数LR预热策略，高LR仅用于加速初始阶段。

Abstract: Training large-scale models presents challenges not only in terms of resource
requirements but also in terms of their convergence. For this reason, the
learning rate (LR) is often decreased when the size of a model is increased.
Such a simple solution is not enough in the case of speech-to-text (S2T)
trainings, where evolved and more complex variants of the Transformer
architecture -- e.g., Conformer or Branchformer -- are used in light of their
better performance. As a workaround, OWSM designed a double linear warmup of
the LR, increasing it to a very small value in the first phase before updating
it to a higher value in the second phase. While this solution worked well in
practice, it was not compared with alternative solutions, nor was the impact on
the final performance of different LR warmup schedules studied. This paper
fills this gap, revealing that i) large-scale S2T trainings demand a
sub-exponential LR warmup, and ii) a higher LR in the warmup phase accelerates
initial convergence, but it does not boost final performance.

TLDR: 论文提出新数据集UAQFact，用于评估LLM在处理不可回答问题时利用事实知识的能力，发现LLM表现不佳且难以充分利用外部知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏事实知识支持，无法全面评估LLM在处理不可回答问题时利用事实知识的能力。

Method: 构建双语数据集UAQFact，基于知识图谱提供辅助事实知识，并定义两个新任务以分别评估LLM利用内部和外部知识的能力。

Result: 实验表明，LLM在UAQFact上表现不佳，即使具备事实知识也难以稳定发挥；外部知识虽能提升性能，但LLM仍无法充分利用。

Conclusion: UAQFact为评估LLM利用事实知识的能力提供了新基准，揭示了LLM在此类任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Handling unanswerable questions (UAQ) is crucial for LLMs, as it helps
prevent misleading responses in complex situations. While previous studies have
built several datasets to assess LLMs' performance on UAQ, these datasets lack
factual knowledge support, which limits the evaluation of LLMs' ability to
utilize their factual knowledge when handling UAQ. To address the limitation,
we introduce a new unanswerable question dataset UAQFact, a bilingual dataset
with auxiliary factual knowledge created from a Knowledge Graph. Based on
UAQFact, we further define two new tasks to measure LLMs' ability to utilize
internal and external factual knowledge, respectively. Our experimental results
across multiple LLM series show that UAQFact presents significant challenges,
as LLMs do not consistently perform well even when they have factual knowledge
stored. Additionally, we find that incorporating external knowledge may enhance
performance, but LLMs still cannot make full use of the knowledge which may
result in incorrect responses.

Result: 6个模型通过考试，但干扰信息导致性能显著下降，降幅达20.4%。

Conclusion: 当前模型在神经外科考试中表现良好，但需提高对干扰信息的鲁棒性以支持临床安全应用。

Abstract: The Congress of Neurological Surgeons Self-Assessment for Neurological
Surgeons (CNS-SANS) questions are widely used by neurosurgical residents to
prepare for written board examinations. Recently, these questions have also
served as benchmarks for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) neurosurgical
knowledge. This study aims to assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs
on neurosurgery board-like questions and to evaluate their robustness to the
inclusion of distractor statements. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted
using 28 large language models. These models were tested on 2,904 neurosurgery
board examination questions derived from the CNS-SANS. Additionally, the study
introduced a distraction framework to assess the fragility of these models. The
framework incorporated simple, irrelevant distractor statements containing
polysemous words with clinical meanings used in non-clinical contexts to
determine the extent to which such distractions degrade model performance on
standard medical benchmarks. 6 of the 28 tested LLMs achieved board-passing
outcomes, with the top-performing models scoring over 15.7% above the passing
threshold. When exposed to distractions, accuracy across various model
architectures was significantly reduced-by as much as 20.4%-with one model
failing that had previously passed. Both general-purpose and medical
open-source models experienced greater performance declines compared to
proprietary variants when subjected to the added distractors. While current
LLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to answer neurosurgery board-like exam
questions, their performance is markedly vulnerable to extraneous, distracting
information. These findings underscore the critical need for developing novel
mitigation strategies aimed at bolstering LLM resilience against in-text
distractions, particularly for safe and effective clinical deployment.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种定量分析大型语言模型（RLLMs）在长链思维推理中过度思考（overthinking）的方法，并引入了一种简单有效的提示方法以减少自我怀疑（self-doubt），从而优化推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多通过定性分析观察长链思维推理中的过度思考现象，缺乏定量研究。本文从自我怀疑的角度出发，量化分析过度思考，并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过提示模型质疑输入问题的有效性，并根据评估结果简洁回答，以减少对问题的过度依赖和自我怀疑。

Result: 在三个数学推理任务和四个缺失前提的数据集上，该方法显著减少了答案长度，并在四种广泛使用的RLLMs上取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了推理步骤和自我怀疑，为优化RLLMs的推理效率提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on complex tasks, largely due to the adoption of Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning. However, they often exhibit overthinking
-- performing unnecessary reasoning steps even after arriving at the correct
answer. Prior work has largely focused on qualitative analyses of overthinking
through sample-based observations of long CoTs. In contrast, we present a
quantitative analysis of overthinking from the perspective of self-doubt,
characterized by excessive token usage devoted to re-verifying already-correct
answer. We find that self-doubt significantly contributes to overthinking. In
response, we introduce a simple and effective prompting method to reduce the
model's over-reliance on input questions, thereby avoiding self-doubt.
Specifically, we first prompt the model to question the validity of the input
question, and then respond concisely based on the outcome of that evaluation.
Experiments on three mathematical reasoning tasks and four datasets with
missing premises demonstrate that our method substantially reduces answer
length and yields significant improvements across nearly all datasets upon 4
widely-used RLLMs. Further analysis demonstrates that our method effectively
minimizes the number of reasoning steps and reduces self-doubt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索码本大小和单元粗细对语音模型性能的影响，填补了相关研究的空白。

Method: 使用简单的时长惩罚动态规划（DPDP）方法，调整码本大小和单元粗细，并在不同语言层级进行分析。

Result: 在音素和单词层级，粗细单元无明显优势；但在句子重合成任务中，粗单元表现更好；在词汇和句法任务中，粗单元在低比特率下准确率更高。

Conclusion: 粗细单元的选择需根据任务需求，DPDP是一种简单高效的方法，适用于需要粗单元的任务。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) operate on acoustic units obtained by
discretizing self-supervised speech representations. Although the
characteristics of these units directly affect performance, the interaction
between codebook size and unit coarseness (i.e., duration) remains unexplored.
We investigate SLM performance as we vary codebook size and unit coarseness
using the simple duration-penalized dynamic programming (DPDP) method. New
analyses are performed across different linguistic levels. At the phone and
word levels, coarseness provides little benefit, as long as the codebook size
is chosen appropriately. However, when producing whole sentences in a
resynthesis task, SLMs perform better with coarser units. In lexical and
syntactic language modeling tasks, coarser units also give higher accuracies at
lower bitrates. We therefore show that coarser units aren't always better, but
that DPDP is a simple and efficient way to obtain coarser units for the tasks
where they are beneficial.

Motivation: 现有KGQA数据集（如WebQSP和CWQ）存在标注不准确、问题模糊或过时等问题，影响评估效果。

Method: KGQAGen结合结构化知识基础、LLM引导生成和符号验证，生成可验证的QA实例。

Result: 构建了KGQAGen-10k基准测试，现有最先进模型表现不佳，显示其挑战性。

Conclusion: KGQAGen为KGQA评估提供了可扩展的框架，呼吁更严格的基准构建。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a
scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the SemEval-2025 Task~6 (PromiseEval),
which focuses on verifying promises in corporate ESG (Environmental, Social,
and Governance) reports. We explore three model architectures to address the
four subtasks of promise identification, supporting evidence assessment,
clarity evaluation, and verification timing. Our first model utilizes ESG-BERT
with task-specific classifier heads, while our second model enhances this
architecture with linguistic features tailored for each subtask. Our third
approach implements a combined subtask model with attention-based sequence
pooling, transformer representations augmented with document metadata, and
multi-objective learning. Experiments on the English portion of the ML-Promise
dataset demonstrate progressive improvement across our models, with our
combined subtask approach achieving a leaderboard score of 0.5268,
outperforming the provided baseline of 0.5227. Our work highlights the
effectiveness of linguistic feature extraction, attention pooling, and
multi-objective learning in promise verification tasks, despite challenges
posed by class imbalance and limited training data.

Motivation: 当前基于结果的标准（如答案正确性或一致性）忽略了响应的内部逻辑一致性，PCPO旨在解决这一问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in preference optimization have demonstrated significant
potential for improving mathematical reasoning capabilities in large language

preference data through outcome-based criteria like answer correctness or
consistency, they fundamentally neglect the internal logical coherence of
responses. To overcome this, we propose Probability-Consistent Preference
Optimization (PCPO), a novel framework that establishes dual quantitative
metrics for preference selection: (1) surface-level answer correctness and (2)
intrinsic token-level probability consistency across responses. Extensive
experiments show that our PCPO consistently outperforms existing outcome-only
criterion approaches across a diverse range of LLMs and benchmarks. Our code is

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在未经专门翻译训练的情况下，为何能表现出强大的翻译能力。

Method: 通过分析现有研究和用户经验，提出“双重性”假设，认为LLMs的翻译能力源于两种不同类型的预训练数据。

Result: LLMs的翻译能力可能源于预训练数据的多样性和内部化方式。

Conclusion: 需要进一步实证研究验证“双重性”假设，并重新思考深度学习时代的翻译概念。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in translation among other things,
demonstrating competitive performance for many language pairs in zero- and
few-shot settings. But unlike dedicated neural machine translation models, LLMs
are not trained on any translation-related objective. What explains their
remarkable translation abilities? Are these abilities grounded in "incidental
bilingualism" (Briakou et al. 2023) in training data? Does instruction tuning
contribute to it? Are LLMs capable of aligning and leveraging semantically
identical or similar monolingual contents from different corners of the
internet that are unlikely to fit in a single context window? I offer some
reflections on this topic, informed by recent studies and growing user
experience. My working hypothesis is that LLMs' translation abilities originate
in two different types of pre-training data that may be internalized by the
models in different ways. I discuss the prospects for testing the "duality"
hypothesis empirically and its implications for reconceptualizing translation,
human and machine, in the age of deep learning.

Abstract: Refusal is a key safety behavior in aligned language models, yet the internal
mechanisms driving refusals remain opaque. In this work, we conduct a
mechanistic study of refusal in instruction-tuned LLMs using sparse
autoencoders to identify latent features that causally mediate refusal
behaviors. We apply our method to two open-source chat models and intervene on
refusal-related features to assess their influence on generation, validating
their behavioral impact across multiple harmful datasets. This enables a
fine-grained inspection of how refusal manifests at the activation level and
addresses key research questions such as investigating upstream-downstream
latent relationship and understanding the mechanisms of adversarial
jailbreaking techniques. We also establish the usefulness of refusal features
in enhancing generalization for linear probes to out-of-distribution
adversarial samples in classification tasks. We open source our code in

Conclusion: 当前LLM方法在有害内容检测中具有局限性，需更精确和鲁棒的系统。

Abstract: As a leading online platform with a vast global audience, YouTube's extensive
reach also makes it susceptible to hosting harmful content, including
disinformation and conspiracy theories. This study explores the use of
open-weight Large Language Models (LLMs), both text-only and multimodal, for
identifying conspiracy theory videos shared on YouTube. Leveraging a labeled
dataset of thousands of videos, we evaluate a variety of LLMs in a zero-shot
setting and compare their performance to a fine-tuned RoBERTa baseline. Results
show that text-based LLMs achieve high recall but lower precision, leading to
increased false positives. Multimodal models lag behind their text-only
counterparts, indicating limited benefits from visual data integration. To
assess real-world applicability, we evaluate the most accurate models on an
unlabeled dataset, finding that RoBERTa achieves performance close to LLMs with
a larger number of parameters. Our work highlights the strengths and
limitations of current LLM-based approaches for online harmful content
detection, emphasizing the need for more precise and robust systems.

Result: 32B模型Satori-SWE-32B在SWE-Bench-Verified上性能媲美或超越100B以上模型。

Conclusion: EvoScale为小参数模型提供高效优化路径，代码和数据将开源。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) perform well on standardized coding benchmarks but
struggle with real-world software engineering tasks such as resolving GitHub
issues in SWE-Bench, especially when model parameters are less than 100B. While
smaller models are preferable in practice due to their lower computational
cost, improving their performance remains challenging. Existing approaches
primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data, which is
expensive to curate at scale. An alternative is test-time scaling: generating
multiple outputs, scoring them using a verifier, and selecting the best one.
Although effective, this strategy often requires excessive sampling and costly
scoring, limiting its practical application. We propose Evolutionary Test-Time
Scaling (EvoScale), a sample-efficient method that treats generation as an
evolutionary process. By iteratively refining outputs via selection and
mutation, EvoScale shifts the output distribution toward higher-scoring
regions, reducing the number of samples needed to find correct solutions. To
reduce the overhead from repeatedly sampling and selection, we train the model
to self-evolve using reinforcement learning (RL). Rather than relying on
external verifiers at inference time, the model learns to self-improve the
scores of its own generations across iterations. Evaluated on
SWE-Bench-Verified, EvoScale enables our 32B model, Satori-SWE-32B, to match or
exceed the performance of models with over 100B parameters while using a few
samples. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.

Abstract: In this work, we present the first study to explore inference-time scaling on
table reasoning tasks. We develop and evaluate two post-training strategies to
enable inference-time scaling: distillation from frontier model reasoning
traces and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). For
distillation, we introduce a large-scale dataset of reasoning traces generated
by DeepSeek-R1, which we use to fine-tune LLMs into the Table-R1-SFT model. For
RLVR, we propose task-specific verifiable reward functions and apply the GRPO
algorithm to obtain the Table-R1-Zero model. We evaluate our Table-R1-series
models across diverse table reasoning tasks, including short-form QA, fact
verification, and free-form QA. Notably, the Table-R1-Zero model matches or
exceeds the performance of GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1, while using only a
7B-parameter LLM. It also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain
datasets. Extensive ablation and qualitative analyses reveal the benefits of
instruction tuning, model architecture choices, and cross-task generalization,
as well as emergence of essential table reasoning skills during RL training.

### [92] [Characterizing the Expressivity of Transformer Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23623)
*Jiaoda Li,Ryan Cotterell*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该论文研究了固定精度Transformer的理论表达能力，证明其在特定线性时序逻辑片段中的表达能力，并与形式语言理论、自动机理论和代数相关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在实证中表现优异，但理论表达能力尚未完全理解，尤其是实际实现中的固定精度和软注意力机制。

Method: 通过分析固定精度、严格未来掩码和软注意力的Transformer模型，将其表达能力与线性时序逻辑片段相关联。

Result: 证明这些Transformer模型与仅包含过去操作符的线性时序逻辑片段具有相同的表达能力，并与形式语言理论等建立了联系。

Conclusion: 理论框架为Transformer表达能力提供了统一理解，实证结果与理论一致：模型在其理论能力范围内的语言上表现完美，超出则失败。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) have achieved widespread empirical
success, but their theoretical expressive power remains only partially
understood. Prior work often relies on idealized models with assumptions --
such as arbitrary numerical precision and hard attention -- that diverge from
real-world transformers. In this work, we provide an exact characterization of
fixed-precision transformers with strict future masking and soft attention, an
idealization that more closely mirrors practical implementations. We show that
these models are precisely as expressive as a specific fragment of linear
temporal logic that includes only a single temporal operator: the past
operator. We further relate this logic to established classes in formal
language theory, automata theory, and algebra, yielding a rich and unified
theoretical framework for understanding transformer expressivity. Finally, we
present empirical results that align closely with our theory: transformers
trained on languages within their theoretical capacity generalize perfectly
over lengths, while they consistently fail to generalize on languages beyond
it.

Motivation: 消除知识图谱构建中对预定义模式的依赖，实现完全自主的图谱构建，同时提升大语言模型的事实性。

Method: 利用大语言模型从文本中提取知识三元组并诱导模式，通过概念化将实例组织到语义类别中。

Result: 构建了ATLAS知识图谱（9亿+节点，59亿边），在多跳QA任务中表现优于基线，模式诱导与人工模式的语义对齐率达95%。

Conclusion: 动态诱导模式的大规模知识图谱可有效补充大语言模型的参数化知识。

Abstract: We present AutoSchemaKG, a framework for fully autonomous knowledge graph
construction that eliminates the need for predefined schemas. Our system
leverages large language models to simultaneously extract knowledge triples and
induce comprehensive schemas directly from text, modeling both entities and
events while employing conceptualization to organize instances into semantic
categories. Processing over 50 million documents, we construct ATLAS (Automated
Triple Linking And Schema induction), a family of knowledge graphs with 900+
million nodes and 5.9 billion edges. This approach outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines on multi-hop QA tasks and enhances LLM factuality. Notably, our
schema induction achieves 95\% semantic alignment with human-crafted schemas
with zero manual intervention, demonstrating that billion-scale knowledge
graphs with dynamically induced schemas can effectively complement parametric
knowledge in large language models.

Result: 规则系统与Claude 3 Opus结合效果接近规则系统，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GeNRe系统为法语性别偏见缓解技术提供了新工具，推动NLP性别平等研究。

Abstract: A significant portion of the textual data used in the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) exhibits gender biases, particularly due to the use
of masculine generics (masculine words that are supposed to refer to mixed
groups of men and women), which can perpetuate and amplify stereotypes. Gender
rewriting, an NLP task that involves automatically detecting and replacing
gendered forms with neutral or opposite forms (e.g., from masculine to
feminine), can be employed to mitigate these biases. While such systems have
been developed in a number of languages (English, Arabic, Portuguese, German,
French), automatic use of gender neutralization techniques (as opposed to
inclusive or gender-switching techniques) has only been studied for English.
This paper presents GeNRe, the very first French gender-neutral rewriting
system using collective nouns, which are gender-fixed in French. We introduce a
rule-based system (RBS) tailored for the French language alongside two
fine-tuned language models trained on data generated by our RBS. We also
explore the use of instruct-based models to enhance the performance of our
other systems and find that Claude 3 Opus combined with our dictionary achieves
results close to our RBS. Through this contribution, we hope to promote the
advancement of gender bias mitigation techniques in NLP for French.

Conclusion: 研究初步揭示了LRMs的幻觉机制，为未来优化提供了方向。

Abstract: Recently evolved large reasoning models (LRMs) show powerful performance in
solving complex tasks with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capability. As
these LRMs are mostly developed by post-training on formal reasoning tasks,
whether they generalize the reasoning capability to help reduce hallucination
in fact-seeking tasks remains unclear and debated. For instance, DeepSeek-R1
reports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while
OpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally
raises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to
hallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1)
We first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our
analysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold
start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate
their hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training
without cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To
explore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on
hallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two
critical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw
Repetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the
same underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer
fails to faithfully match the previous CoT process. (3) Further, we investigate
the mechanism behind the hallucination of LRMs from the perspective of model
uncertainty. We find that increased hallucination of LRMs is usually associated
with the misalignment between model uncertainty and factual accuracy. Our work
provides an initial understanding of the hallucination in LRMs.

TLDR: 论文研究了指令调优的大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成摘要时是否充分保留关键论证角色信息，并提出了Argument Representation Coverage（ARC）框架来评估LLMs的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在抽象摘要中，结构化信息（如论证角色）对保留重要内容至关重要，尤其是在法律等高风险领域。本文旨在验证LLMs是否能有效保留这些信息。

Method: 引入ARC框架，用于衡量LLMs生成的摘要对关键论证角色的覆盖程度。分析了三个开源LLMs在法律意见和科学文章两个领域的表现。

Result: LLMs在一定程度上能覆盖关键论证角色，但在输入中论证分布稀疏时，重要信息常被遗漏。还发现LLMs的位置偏差和角色偏好会影响论证覆盖。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs在保留论证角色方面仍有不足，需要开发更具论证意识的摘要策略。

Abstract: Integrating structured information has long improved the quality of
abstractive summarization, particularly in retaining salient content. In this
work, we focus on a specific form of structure: argument roles, which are
crucial for summarizing documents in high-stakes domains such as law. We
investigate whether instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) adequately
preserve this information. To this end, we introduce Argument Representation
Coverage (ARC), a framework for measuring how well LLM-generated summaries
capture salient arguments. Using ARC, we analyze summaries produced by three
open-weight LLMs in two domains where argument roles are central: long legal
opinions and scientific articles. Our results show that while LLMs cover
salient argument roles to some extent, critical information is often omitted in
generated summaries, particularly when arguments are sparsely distributed
throughout the input. Further, we use ARC to uncover behavioral patterns --
specifically, how the positional bias of LLM context windows and role-specific
preferences impact the coverage of key arguments in generated summaries,
emphasizing the need for more argument-aware summarization strategies.

TLDR: 提出了一种新的解码策略ActLCD，通过强化学习优化生成内容的真实性，减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码方法在长上下文生成中仍易产生幻觉，需改进。

Method: ActLCD采用强化学习策略，结合奖励感知分类器，动态决定对比层的应用时机。

Result: 在五个基准测试中优于现有方法，有效减少幻觉。

Conclusion: ActLCD在多样化生成场景中显著提升事实性。

Abstract: Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language
models~(LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation.
These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal
representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain
prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we
propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy
that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By
casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a
reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize
factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.

Result: 14个先进大语言模型在标准多轮设置中表现良好，但在ToolHaystack中表现显著下降。

Conclusion: ToolHaystack揭示了现有模型在长期鲁棒性上的关键缺陷，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in using
external tools to address user inquiries. However, most existing evaluations
assume tool use in short contexts, offering limited insight into model behavior
during realistic long-term interactions. To fill this gap, we introduce
ToolHaystack, a benchmark for testing the tool use capabilities in long-term
interactions. Each test instance in ToolHaystack includes multiple tasks
execution contexts and realistic noise within a continuous conversation,
enabling assessment of how well models maintain context and handle various
disruptions. By applying this benchmark to 14 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that while current models perform well in standard multi-turn settings, they
often significantly struggle in ToolHaystack, highlighting critical gaps in
their long-term robustness not revealed by previous tool benchmarks.

TLDR: LoLA是一种低秩线性注意力方法，通过稀疏缓存和三种内存形式（滑动窗口、全局缓存和循环隐藏状态）提升长序列任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在长序列推理时的二次复杂度问题，以及线性注意力方法对softmax注意力近似不准确的问题。

Method: 结合滑动窗口注意力、稀疏全局缓存和循环隐藏状态，设计低秩线性注意力（LoLA）。

Result: 在8K上下文长度任务中表现优异，准确率从0.6%提升至97.4%，缓存大小仅为Llama-3.1 8B的1/4.6。

Conclusion: LoLA是一种轻量级高效方法，显著提升了长序列任务的性能，适用于消费级GPU。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models suffer from quadratic complexity at
inference on long sequences. Linear attention methods are efficient
alternatives, however, they fail to provide an accurate approximation of
softmax attention. By additionally incorporating sliding window attention into
each linear attention head, this gap can be closed for short context-length
tasks. Unfortunately, these approaches cannot recall important information from
long contexts due to "memory collisions". In this paper , we propose LoLA:
Low-rank Linear Attention with sparse caching. LoLA separately stores
additional key-value pairs that would otherwise interfere with past associative
memories. Moreover, LoLA further closes the gap between linear attention models
and transformers by distributing past key-value pairs into three forms of
memory: (i) recent pairs in a local sliding window; (ii) difficult-to-memorize
pairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent
hidden state of linear attention. As an inference-only strategy, LoLA enables
pass-key retrieval on up to 8K context lengths on needle-in-a-haystack tasks
from RULER. It boosts the accuracy of the base subquadratic model from 0.6% to
97.4% at 4K context lengths, with a 4.6x smaller cache than that of Llama-3.1
8B. LoLA demonstrates strong performance on zero-shot commonsense reasoning
tasks among 1B and 8B parameter subquadratic models. Finally, LoLA is an
extremely lightweight approach: Nearly all of our results can be reproduced on
a single consumer GPU.

<details>

Motivation: 当前语音研究中缺乏针对多变语音现象的自动标注工具，而预训练模型如wav2vec2.0在语音分类任务中表现优异。

Method: 使用wav2vec2.0模型训练自动分类爆破音，测试其在英语和日语中的表现，并对比手动标注结果。

Result: 模型在英语和日语中均能高精度分类爆破音，且与手动标注结果高度一致。

Conclusion: 预训练模型为语音数据的自动标注提供了高效工具，有助于扩大语音研究的规模。

Abstract: Modern phonetic research regularly makes use of automatic tools for the
annotation of speech data, however few tools exist for the annotation of many
variable phonetic phenomena. At the same time, pre-trained self-supervised
models, such as wav2vec2.0, have been shown to perform well at speech
classification tasks and latently encode fine-grained phonetic information. We
demonstrate that wav2vec2.0 models can be trained to automatically classify
stop burst presence with high accuracy in both English and Japanese, robust
across both finely-curated and unprepared speech corpora. Patterns of
variability in stop realisation are replicated with the automatic annotations,
and closely follow those of manual annotations. These results demonstrate the
potential of pre-trained speech models as tools for the automatic annotation
and processing of speech corpus data, enabling researchers to `scale-up' the
scope of phonetic research with relative ease.

Motivation: 验证CDL在不同语言、模型类型和评估设置中的通用性，并改进现有基准测试的不足。

Method: 比较CDL与维基百科训练的模型，涵盖两种目标（掩码和因果）、三种语言（英、法、德）和三个句法最小对基准，并引入新测试方法FIT-CLAMS。

Result: CDL在多数情况下表现不如维基百科模型，且需频率控制以平衡比较。

Conclusion: CDL并未带来更强的句法泛化能力，频率效应在评估中至关重要。

Abstract: Seminal work by Huebner et al. (2021) showed that language models (LMs)
trained on English Child-Directed Language (CDL) can reach similar syntactic
abilities as LMs trained on much larger amounts of adult-directed written text,
suggesting that CDL could provide more effective LM training material than the
commonly used internet-crawled data. However, the generalizability of these
results across languages, model types, and evaluation settings remains unclear.
We test this by comparing models trained on CDL vs. Wikipedia across two LM
objectives (masked and causal), three languages (English, French, German), and
three syntactic minimal-pair benchmarks. Our results on these benchmarks show
inconsistent benefits of CDL, which in most cases is outperformed by Wikipedia
models. We then identify various shortcomings in previous benchmarks, and
introduce a novel testing methodology, FIT-CLAMS, which uses a
frequency-controlled design to enable balanced comparisons across training
corpora. Through minimal pair evaluations and regression analysis we show that
training on CDL does not yield stronger generalizations for acquiring syntax
and highlight the importance of controlling for frequency effects when
evaluating syntactic ability.

Motivation: 研究动机是揭示传统评估方法对大型语言模型（LLM）数学推理能力的局限性，区分抽象表达和算术计算对准确评估的重要性。

Method: 方法包括在GSM8K和SVAMP数据集上对Llama-3和Qwen2.5模型进行解耦评估，分析CoT的作用，并通过因果修补验证抽象表达的存在。

Result: 结果显示算术计算是主要瓶颈，CoT对计算帮助显著但对抽象表达影响有限，且抽象表达先于计算发生。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要解耦评估方法以更准确衡量LLM的推理能力，并指导未来改进。

Abstract: Final-answer-based metrics are commonly used for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) on math word problems, often taken as proxies for reasoning
ability. However, such metrics conflate two distinct sub-skills: abstract
formulation (capturing mathematical relationships using expressions) and
arithmetic computation (executing the calculations). Through a disentangled
evaluation on GSM8K and SVAMP, we find that the final-answer accuracy of
Llama-3 and Qwen2.5 (1B-32B) without CoT is overwhelmingly bottlenecked by the
arithmetic computation step and not by the abstract formulation step. Contrary
to the common belief, we show that CoT primarily aids in computation, with
limited impact on abstract formulation. Mechanistically, we show that these two
skills are composed conjunctively even in a single forward pass without any
reasoning steps via an abstract-then-compute mechanism: models first capture
problem abstractions, then handle computation. Causal patching confirms these
abstractions are present, transferable, composable, and precede computation.
These behavioural and mechanistic findings highlight the need for disentangled
evaluation to accurately assess LLM reasoning and to guide future improvements.

Motivation: 现有评估框架过于简化现实场景，无法挑战先进模型，因此需要更系统的评估工具。

Method: 引入SocialMaze基准，包含六个任务，覆盖三个核心挑战（深度推理、动态交互和信息不确定性），并通过自动和人工验证确保数据质量。

Result: 评估显示模型在动态交互和不确定性下表现差异显著，链式思维推理强的模型表现更好，针对性微调可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: SocialMaze为LLMs的社会推理能力提供了系统评估工具，并展示了改进方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to socially grounded
tasks, such as online community moderation, media content analysis, and social
reasoning games. Success in these contexts depends on a model's social
reasoning ability - the capacity to interpret social contexts, infer others'
mental states, and assess the truthfulness of presented information. However,
there is currently no systematic evaluation framework that comprehensively
assesses the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing efforts often
oversimplify real-world scenarios and consist of tasks that are too basic to
challenge advanced models. To address this gap, we introduce SocialMaze, a new
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate social reasoning. SocialMaze
systematically incorporates three core challenges: deep reasoning, dynamic
interaction, and information uncertainty. It provides six diverse tasks across
three key settings: social reasoning games, daily-life interactions, and
digital community platforms. Both automated and human validation are used to
ensure data quality. Our evaluation reveals several key insights: models vary
substantially in their ability to handle dynamic interactions and integrate
temporally evolving information; models with strong chain-of-thought reasoning
perform better on tasks requiring deeper inference beyond surface-level cues;
and model reasoning degrades significantly under uncertainty. Furthermore, we
show that targeted fine-tuning on curated reasoning examples can greatly
improve model performance in complex social scenarios. The dataset is publicly

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for high-quality evaluation datasets
in low-resource languages to advance cross-lingual transfer. While
cross-lingual transfer offers a key strategy for leveraging multilingual
pretraining to expand language technologies to understudied and typologically
diverse languages, its effectiveness is dependent on quality and suitable
benchmarks. We release new sense-annotated datasets of sentences containing
polysemous words, spanning nine low-resource languages across diverse language
families and scripts. To facilitate dataset creation, the paper presents a
demonstrably beneficial semi-automatic annotation method. The utility of the
datasets is demonstrated through Word-in-Context (WiC) formatted experiments
that evaluate transfer on these low-resource languages. Results highlight the
importance of targeted dataset creation and evaluation for effective polysemy
disambiguation in low-resource settings and transfer studies. The released
datasets and code aim to support further research into fair, robust, and truly
multilingual NLP.

Motivation: LLMs在快速发展的同时，常因接受错误前提导致推理不可靠，凸显了前提批判能力的重要性。现有研究多忽略LLMs在错误前提下的表现。

Method: 引入PCBench，包含四种错误类型和三个难度级别，结合多维度评估指标，对15种代表性LLMs进行系统评估。

Result: 发现LLMs依赖显式提示检测错误，自主批判能力有限；前提批判能力受问题难度和错误类型影响；推理能力与前提批判能力无直接关联；错误前提导致模型过度思考。

Conclusion: 提升LLMs对输入有效性的主动评估能力至关重要，前提批判能力是开发可靠系统的关键。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have witnessed rapid advancements, demonstrating
remarkable capabilities. However, a notable vulnerability persists: LLMs often
uncritically accept flawed or contradictory premises, leading to inefficient
reasoning and unreliable outputs. This emphasizes the significance of
possessing the \textbf{Premise Critique Ability} for LLMs, defined as the
capacity to proactively identify and articulate errors in input premises. Most
existing studies assess LLMs' reasoning ability in ideal settings, largely
ignoring their vulnerabilities when faced with flawed premises. Thus, we
introduce the \textbf{Premise Critique Bench (PCBench)}, designed by
incorporating four error types across three difficulty levels, paired with
multi-faceted evaluation metrics. We conducted systematic evaluations of 15
representative LLMs. Our findings reveal: (1) Most models rely heavily on
explicit prompts to detect errors, with limited autonomous critique; (2)
Premise critique ability depends on question difficulty and error type, with
direct contradictions being easier to detect than complex or procedural errors;
(3) Reasoning ability does not consistently correlate with the premise critique
ability; (4) Flawed premises trigger overthinking in reasoning models, markedly
lengthening responses due to repeated attempts at resolving conflicts. These
insights underscore the urgent need to enhance LLMs' proactive evaluation of
input validity, positioning premise critique as a foundational capability for
developing reliable, human-centric systems. The code is available at

Conclusion: DEER通过有效利用标签信息，显著提升了ICL在NER任务中的性能，适用于已知和未知实体以及低资源场景。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform new
tasks using only a few demonstrations. In Named Entity Recognition (NER),
demonstrations are typically selected based on semantic similarity to the test
instance, ignoring training labels and resulting in suboptimal performance. We
introduce DEER, a new method that leverages training labels through token-level
statistics to improve ICL performance. DEER first enhances example selection
with a label-guided, token-based retriever that prioritizes tokens most
informative for entity recognition. It then prompts the LLM to revisit
error-prone tokens, which are also identified using label statistics, and make
targeted corrections. Evaluated on five NER datasets using four different LLMs,
DEER consistently outperforms existing ICL methods and approaches the
performance of supervised fine-tuning. Further analysis shows its effectiveness

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于学习型LLM代理的ML框架，通过在线强化学习优化ML任务，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理依赖手动提示工程，缺乏自适应优化能力，因此探索学习型代理以提升ML任务效率。

Method: 提出包含探索增强微调、逐步强化学习和统一奖励模块的框架，训练7B规模的ML-Agent。

Result: ML-Agent在9个任务上训练后，性能超过671B规模的DeepSeek-R1代理，并展示出跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 学习型代理框架有效提升了ML任务的自主性和性能，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The emergence of large language model (LLM)-based agents has significantly
advanced the development of autonomous machine learning (ML) engineering.
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering,
failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences.
Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based
agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML
tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a
novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1)
exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse
actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training
on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving
training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies
varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization.
Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM
for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our
7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it
achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional
cross-task generalization capabilities.

TLDR: SITAlign是一种推理时间框架，通过最大化主要目标并满足次要标准的阈值约束，解决对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将人类偏好反馈视为多目标优化问题，但忽略了人类决策的实际方式，即满足主要目标并确保次要目标达到可接受阈值。

Method: 提出SITAlign框架，在推理时最大化主要目标，同时满足次要标准的阈值约束。

Result: 在PKU-SafeRLHF数据集上，SITAlign在保持无害性阈值的同时，在GPT-4胜率方面比现有方法高出22.3%。

Conclusion: SITAlign通过满足次要标准的阈值约束，有效解决了多目标对齐问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with humans is challenging due to the
inherently multifaceted nature of preference feedback. While existing
approaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they
often overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded
rationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing
strategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable
thresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing
alignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the
multifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while
satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide
theoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based
inference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance
through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the
PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while
ensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4
win-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on
harmlessness.

TLDR: 论文提出了ATLAS，一种高容量的长期记忆模块，解决了现代循环神经网络在长上下文理解和序列外推任务中的不足，并通过实验验证其优于Transformer和线性循环模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在长序列任务中因二次复杂度受限，而现代循环神经网络在长上下文理解和外推任务中表现不佳，主要源于其设计中的三个缺陷：有限的内存容量、在线更新机制和固定内存管理。

Method: 提出ATLAS模块，通过优化当前和过去令牌的内存，克服在线更新的局限性，并基于此设计了DeepTransformers架构。

Result: 实验表明，ATLAS在语言建模、常识推理和长上下文任务中优于Transformer和线性循环模型，并在BABILong基准测试中显著提升长上下文性能。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过改进记忆模块的设计，显著提升了长序列任务的性能，为序列建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have been established as the most popular backbones in sequence
modeling, mainly due to their effectiveness in in-context retrieval tasks and
the ability to learn at scale. Their quadratic memory and time complexity,
however, bound their applicability in longer sequences and so has motivated
researchers to explore effective alternative architectures such as modern
recurrent neural networks (a.k.a long-term recurrent memory module). Despite
their recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that
requires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We
observe that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their
design: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of
memory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e.,
optimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less
expressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three
aspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that
learns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current
and past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models.
Building on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like
architectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the
original Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language
modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context
understanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers
and recent linear recurrent models. ATLAS further improves the long context
performance of Titans, achieving +80\% accuracy in 10M context length of
BABILong benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动定理证明（ATP）方法依赖形式化证明系统，与LLM从预训练中获得的非正式自然语言知识不匹配，因此需要一种更符合LLM优势的非正式定理证明方法。

Method: 提出DeepTheorem框架，包括121K高质量IMO级非正式定理和证明的数据集，以及专为非正式定理证明设计的强化学习策略RL-Zero。

Result: 实验表明，DeepTheorem显著优于现有数据集和监督微调方法，实现了最先进的准确性和推理质量。

Conclusion: DeepTheorem有潜力从根本上推动非正式定理证明和数学探索的发展。

Abstract: Theorem proving serves as a major testbed for evaluating complex reasoning
abilities in large language models (LLMs). However, traditional automated
theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that
poorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language
knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a
comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to
enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale
benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems
and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for
correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically
constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement
learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving,
leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical
inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process
evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning
steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly
improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and
supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and
reasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to
fundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical
exploration.

TLDR: 本文研究了当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在解决Rebus谜题（一种通过图像、空间排列和符号替换编码语言的视觉谜题）时的能力，发现其在抽象推理和视觉隐喻理解方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rebus谜题对VLMs提出了独特挑战，需要多模态抽象、符号推理以及对文化、语音和语言双关的理解，而传统任务（如图像描述或问答）无法涵盖这些能力。

Method: 通过构建一个手工生成和标注的多样化英语Rebus谜题基准，评估不同VLMs的表现。

Result: 研究发现，VLMs在解码简单视觉线索时表现出一定能力，但在需要抽象推理、横向思维和视觉隐喻理解的任务中表现显著不足。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在处理复杂多模态任务（如Rebus谜题）时仍存在局限性，尤其是在抽象和隐喻理解方面。

Abstract: Rebus puzzles, visual riddles that encode language through imagery, spatial
arrangement, and symbolic substitution, pose a unique challenge to current
vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional image captioning or question
answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic
reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this
paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve
rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of
diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic
substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how
different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some
surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle
significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and
understanding visual metaphors.

Conclusion: 论文强调了聚合问答任务的重要性，并展示了现有方法的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly
becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts
of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal
interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches
typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights
that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale
conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering,
a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of
user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying
emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this
direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative
questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments
show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur
prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches
capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.

Result: 在CroHD和CrowdHuman数据集上，MOTA和mAP表现提升。

Conclusion: 该框架在拥挤场景中有效提升了微小头部检测和跟踪的性能。

Abstract: Head detection and tracking are essential for downstream tasks, but current
methods often require large computational budgets, which increase latencies and
ties up resources (e.g., processors, memory, and bandwidth). To address this,
we propose a framework to enhance tiny head detection and tracking by
optimizing the balance between performance and efficiency. Our framework
integrates (1) a cross-domain detection loss, (2) a multi-scale module, and (3)
a small receptive field detection mechanism. These innovations enhance
detection by bridging the gap between large and small detectors, capturing
high-frequency details at multiple scales during training, and using filters
with small receptive fields to detect tiny heads. Evaluations on the CroHD and
CrowdHuman datasets show improved Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and
mean Average Precision (mAP), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach
in crowded scenes.

Motivation: 稀有动物图像分类面临数据稀缺的挑战，许多物种仅有少量标记样本，需要一种高效的方法来提取和利用有限数据。

Method: 设计了一个混合框架，包括自适应DCT预处理模块、ViT-B16和ResNet50主干网络，以及贝叶斯线性分类头。通过自适应频率选择机制提取特征，并融合频率域和空间域信息。

Result: 在自建的50类野生动物数据集上，该方法优于传统CNN和固定频带DCT方法，在极少量样本下达到了最优准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应频率选择机制和混合框架有效解决了数据稀缺问题，为稀有动物图像分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: A major challenge in rare animal image classification is the scarcity of
data, as many species usually have only a small number of labeled samples.
  To address this challenge, we designed a hybrid deep-learning framework
comprising a novel adaptive DCT preprocessing module, ViT-B16 and ResNet50
backbones, and a Bayesian linear classification head. To our knowledge, we are
the first to introduce an adaptive frequency-domain selection mechanism that
learns optimal low-, mid-, and high-frequency boundaries suited to the
subsequent backbones.
  Our network first captures image frequency-domain cues via this adaptive DCT
partitioning. The adaptively filtered frequency features are then fed into
ViT-B16 to model global contextual relationships, while ResNet50 concurrently
extracts local, multi-scale spatial representations from the original image. A
cross-level fusion strategy seamlessly integrates these frequency- and
spatial-domain embeddings, and the fused features are passed through a Bayesian
linear classifier to output the final category predictions. On our self-built
50-class wildlife dataset, this approach outperforms conventional CNN and
fixed-band DCT pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy under extreme
sample scarcity.

Conclusion: HiDream-I1及其扩展模型为多模态AIGC研究提供了高效、灵活的工具，并已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image generative foundation models have prioritized
quality improvements but often at the cost of increased computational
complexity and inference latency. To address this critical trade-off, we
introduce HiDream-I1, a new open-source image generative foundation model with
17B parameters that achieves state-of-the-art image generation quality within
seconds. HiDream-I1 is constructed with a new sparse Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) structure. Specifically, it starts with a dual-stream decoupled design of
sparse DiT with dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, in which two
separate encoders are first involved to independently process image and text
tokens. Then, a single-stream sparse DiT structure with dynamic MoE
architecture is adopted to trigger multi-model interaction for image generation
in a cost-efficient manner. To support flexiable accessibility with varied
model capabilities, we provide HiDream-I1 in three variants: HiDream-I1-Full,
HiDream-I1-Dev, and HiDream-I1-Fast.
  Furthermore, we go beyond the typical text-to-image generation and remould
HiDream-I1 with additional image conditions to perform precise,
instruction-based editing on given images, yielding a new instruction-based
image editing model namely HiDream-E1. Ultimately, by integrating text-to-image
generation and instruction-based image editing, HiDream-I1 evolves to form a
comprehensive image agent (HiDream-A1) capable of fully interactive image
creation and refinement. To accelerate multi-modal AIGC research, we have
open-sourced all the codes and model weights of HiDream-I1-Full,
HiDream-I1-Dev, HiDream-I1-Fast, HiDream-E1 through our project websites:

Conclusion: MIAS-SAM无需阈值设定即可实现高精度异常分割，适用于多种医学图像模态，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents MIAS-SAM, a novel approach for the segmentation of
anomalous regions in medical images. MIAS-SAM uses a patch-based memory bank to
store relevant image features, which are extracted from normal data using the
SAM encoder. At inference time, the embedding patches extracted from the SAM
encoder are compared with those in the memory bank to obtain the anomaly map.
Finally, MIAS-SAM computes the center of gravity of the anomaly map to prompt
the SAM decoder, obtaining an accurate segmentation from the previously
extracted features. Differently from prior works, MIAS-SAM does not require to
define a threshold value to obtain the segmentation from the anomaly map.
Experimental results conducted on three publicly available datasets, each with
a different imaging modality (Brain MRI, Liver CT, and Retina OCT) show
accurate anomaly segmentation capabilities measured using DICE score. The code

Result: 实验表明Rhet2Pix在修辞文本到图像生成上优于GPT-4o和Grok-3等SOTA模型。

Conclusion: Rhet2Pix有效解决了修辞语言生成图像的挑战，为多模态模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generating images from rhetorical languages remains a critical challenge for
text-to-image models. Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal large language
models (MLLM) fail to generate images based on the hidden meaning inherent in
rhetorical language--despite such content being readily mappable to visual
representations by humans. A key limitation is that current models emphasize
object-level word embedding alignment, causing metaphorical expressions to
steer image generation towards their literal visuals and overlook the intended
semantic meaning. To address this, we propose Rhet2Pix, a framework that
formulates rhetorical text-to-image generation as a multi-step policy
optimization problem, incorporating a two-layer MDP diffusion module. In the
outer layer, Rhet2Pix converts the input prompt into incrementally elaborated
sub-sentences and executes corresponding image-generation actions, constructing
semantically richer visuals. In the inner layer, Rhet2Pix mitigates reward
sparsity during image generation by discounting the final reward and optimizing
every adjacent action pair along the diffusion denoising trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Rhet2Pix in rhetorical
text-to-image generation. Our model outperforms SOTA MLLMs such as GPT-4o,
Grok-3 and leading academic baselines across both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.

Result: 提出了一套系统分析VLMs文化能力的框架。

Conclusion: 视觉文化研究的方法对提升VLMs文化能力分析至关重要，未来可基于此框架进一步研究。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) often fail at cultural competency
evaluations and benchmarks. Given the diversity of applications built upon
VLMs, there is renewed interest in understanding how they encode cultural
nuances. While individual aspects of this problem have been studied, we still
lack a comprehensive framework for systematically identifying and annotating
the nuanced cultural dimensions present in images for VLMs. This position paper
argues that foundational methodologies from visual culture studies (cultural
studies, semiotics, and visual studies) are necessary for cultural analysis of
images. Building upon this review, we propose a set of five frameworks,
corresponding to cultural dimensions, that must be considered for a more
complete analysis of the cultural competencies of VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MPI重建方法依赖耗时校准或特定扫描轨迹，限制了其灵活性和通用性。本文旨在开发一种不依赖特定轨迹的模型重建算法，提高MPI的适用性。

Method: 提出了一种轨迹独立的模型重建算法，结合零-shot PnP算法和自动噪声水平估计，利用自然图像训练的降噪器，无需MPI特定数据重新训练。

Result: 在公开的2D FFP MPI数据集和自定义数据上验证了算法的有效性，展示了在不同扫描场景下的强大重建能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用、灵活的模型MPI重建奠定了基础，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a promising tomographic technique for
visualizing the spatio-temporal distribution of superparamagnetic
nanoparticles, with applications ranging from cancer detection to real-time
cardiovascular monitoring. Traditional MPI reconstruction relies on either
time-consuming calibration (measured system matrix) or model-based simulation
of the forward operator. Recent developments have shown the applicability of
Chebyshev polynomials to multi-dimensional Lissajous Field-Free Point (FFP)
scans. This method is bound to the particular choice of sinusoidal scanning
trajectories. In this paper, we present the first reconstruction on real 2D MPI
data with a trajectory-independent model-based MPI reconstruction algorithm. We
further develop the zero-shot Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm of the authors --
with automatic noise level estimation -- to address the present deconvolution
problem, leveraging a state-of-the-art denoiser trained on natural images
without retraining on MPI-specific data. We evaluate our method on the publicly
available 2D FFP MPI dataset ``MPIdata: Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy",
featuring scans of six phantoms acquired using a Bruker preclinical scanner.
Moreover, we show reconstruction performed on custom data on a 2D scanner with
additional high-frequency excitation field and partial data. Our results
demonstrate strong reconstruction capabilities across different scanning
scenarios -- setting a precedent for general-purpose, flexible model-based MPI
reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解基准忽视文本信息，OCR基准局限于静态图像，无法捕捉文本与动态视觉的交互。

Method: 提出VidText基准，涵盖多样化场景和多层次任务（视频级、片段级、实例级），并引入感知推理任务。

Result: 实验显示当前大型多模态模型在多数任务中表现不佳，改进空间大。

Conclusion: VidText填补了视频理解基准的空白，为未来动态环境中的多模态推理研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Visual texts embedded in videos carry rich semantic information, which is
crucial for both holistic video understanding and fine-grained reasoning about
local human actions. However, existing video understanding benchmarks largely
overlook textual information, while OCR-specific benchmarks are constrained to
static images, limiting their ability to capture the interaction between text
and dynamic visual contexts. To address this gap, we propose VidText, a new
benchmark designed for comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of video text
understanding. VidText offers the following key features: 1) It covers a wide
range of real-world scenarios and supports multilingual content, encompassing
diverse settings where video text naturally appears. 2) It introduces a
hierarchical evaluation framework with video-level, clip-level, and
instance-level tasks, enabling assessment of both global summarization and
local retrieval capabilities. 3) The benchmark also introduces a set of paired
perception reasoning tasks, ranging from visual text perception to cross-modal
reasoning between textual and visual information. Extensive experiments on 18
state-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) reveal that current models
struggle across most tasks, with significant room for improvement. Further
analysis highlights the impact of both model-intrinsic factors, such as input
resolution and OCR capability, and external factors, including the use of
auxiliary information and Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies. We hope
VidText will fill the current gap in video understanding benchmarks and serve
as a foundation for future research on multimodal reasoning with video text in
dynamic environments.

*Zhangyi Hu,Jiemin Wu,Hua Xu,Mingqian Liao,Ninghui Feng,Bo Gao,Songning Lai,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: VIMTS是一个基于视觉MAE的框架，用于处理不规则多变量时间序列（IMTS）预测，通过补全缺失数据和利用跨通道依赖关系，结合自监督学习，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多通道信号未对齐和大量缺失数据，IMTS预测具有挑战性。现有方法难以捕捉可靠的时序模式，而预训练基础模型通常仅适用于规则采样时间序列（RTS）。

Method: VIMTS将IMTS沿时间线划分为等间隔特征块，利用跨通道依赖关系补全数据，并采用视觉MAE处理稀疏多通道数据，结合粗到细技术生成精确预测。

Result: 实验表明VIMTS在IMTS预测中表现优异，并具备少样本学习能力。

Conclusion: VIMTS成功将视觉基础模型应用于更广泛的时间序列任务，为IMTS预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) forecasting is challenging due to
the unaligned nature of multi-channel signals and the prevalence of extensive
missing data. Existing methods struggle to capture reliable temporal patterns
from such data due to significant missing values. While pre-trained foundation
models show potential for addressing these challenges, they are typically
designed for Regularly Sampled Time Series (RTS). Motivated by the visual Mask
AutoEncoder's (MAE) powerful capability for modeling sparse multi-channel
information and its success in RTS forecasting, we propose VIMTS, a framework
adapting Visual MAE for IMTS forecasting. To mitigate the effect of missing
values, VIMTS first processes IMTS along the timeline into feature patches at
equal intervals. These patches are then complemented using learned
cross-channel dependencies. Then it leverages visual MAE's capability in
handling sparse multichannel data for patch reconstruction, followed by a
coarse-to-fine technique to generate precise predictions from focused contexts.
In addition, we integrate self-supervised learning for improved IMTS modeling
by adapting the visual MAE to IMTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
VIMTS's superior performance and few-shot capability, advancing the application
of visual foundation models in more general time series tasks. Our code is

*Kostas Triaridis,Panagiotis Kaliosis,E-Ro Nguyen,Jingyi Xu,Hieu Le,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: C-REX是一种基于对比学习的新框架，用于解决Referring Expression Counting（REC）任务，通过增强判别性表示学习，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在区分视觉相似但对应不同指代表达的对象时表现不佳，因此需要一种更稳定的对比学习框架。

Method: 提出C-REX，完全在图像空间内操作，避免图像-文本对比学习的错位问题，并提供更大的负样本池。

Result: C-REX在REC任务中MAE和RMSE分别提升22%和10%，并在类无关计数任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: C-REX不仅解决了REC任务的核心挑战，还展示了其通用性，适用于其他类似任务。

Abstract: Object counting has progressed from class-specific models, which count only
known categories, to class-agnostic models that generalize to unseen
categories. The next challenge is Referring Expression Counting (REC), where
the goal is to count objects based on fine-grained attributes and contextual
differences. Existing methods struggle with distinguishing visually similar
objects that belong to the same category but correspond to different referring
expressions. To address this, we propose C-REX, a novel contrastive learning
framework, based on supervised contrastive learning, designed to enhance
discriminative representation learning. Unlike prior works, C-REX operates
entirely within the image space, avoiding the misalignment issues of image-text
contrastive learning, thus providing a more stable contrastive signal. It also
guarantees a significantly larger pool of negative samples, leading to improved
robustness in the learned representations. Moreover, we showcase that our
framework is versatile and generic enough to be applied to other similar tasks
like class-agnostic counting. To support our approach, we analyze the key
components of sota detection-based models and identify that detecting object
centroids instead of bounding boxes is the key common factor behind their
success in counting tasks. We use this insight to design a simple yet effective
detection-based baseline to build upon. Our experiments show that C-REX
achieves state-of-the-art results in REC, outperforming previous methods by
more than 22\% in MAE and more than 10\% in RMSE, while also demonstrating
strong performance in class-agnostic counting. Code is available at

*Kornel Howil,Joanna Waczyńska,Piotr Borycki,Tadeusz Dziarmaga,Marcin Mazur,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: CLIPGaussians首次提出了一种支持文本和图像引导的多模态风格迁移框架，适用于2D图像、视频、3D对象和4D场景，直接在GS表示上操作，无需大型生成模型或从头训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GS在3D场景渲染中表现高效，但风格迁移（尤其是超出简单颜色变化）仍具挑战性。

Method: 直接在GS基元上操作，作为插件模块集成到现有GS流程中，联合优化3D和4D中的颜色和几何形状，并保持视频的时间一致性。

Result: 在所有任务中展示了优越的风格保真度和一致性，验证了其作为多模态风格迁移的通用高效解决方案。

Conclusion: CLIPGaussians是一种高效且通用的多模态风格迁移方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently emerged as an efficient representation
for rendering 3D scenes from 2D images and has been extended to images, videos,
and dynamic 4D content. However, applying style transfer to GS-based
representations, especially beyond simple color changes, remains challenging.
In this work, we introduce CLIPGaussians, the first unified style transfer
framework that supports text- and image-guided stylization across multiple
modalities: 2D images, videos, 3D objects, and 4D scenes. Our method operates
directly on Gaussian primitives and integrates into existing GS pipelines as a
plug-in module, without requiring large generative models or retraining from
scratch. CLIPGaussians approach enables joint optimization of color and
geometry in 3D and 4D settings, and achieves temporal coherence in videos,
while preserving a model size. We demonstrate superior style fidelity and
consistency across all tasks, validating CLIPGaussians as a universal and
efficient solution for multimodal style transfer.

TLDR: ProbRes是一种基于跳扩散的概率残差搜索框架，用于开放世界的自我中心活动识别，通过平衡先验引导的探索和似然驱动的利用，高效导航搜索空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界的自我中心活动识别具有挑战性，因为其无约束性质要求模型从部分观察的广阔搜索空间中推断未见过的活动。

Method: ProbRes整合结构化常识先验构建语义连贯的搜索空间，利用视觉语言模型自适应优化预测，并通过随机搜索机制高效定位高似然活动标签。

Result: 在多个开放级别（L0-L3）上系统评估，ProbRes在基准数据集（GTEA Gaze、GTEA Gaze+、EPIC-Kitchens和Charades-Ego）上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提出了开放世界识别的清晰分类法，还明确了自我中心活动理解所需的挑战和方法进展。

Abstract: Open-world egocentric activity recognition poses a fundamental challenge due
to its unconstrained nature, requiring models to infer unseen activities from
an expansive, partially observed search space. We introduce ProbRes, a
Probabilistic Residual search framework based on jump-diffusion that
efficiently navigates this space by balancing prior-guided exploration with
likelihood-driven exploitation. Our approach integrates structured commonsense
priors to construct a semantically coherent search space, adaptively refines
predictions using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and employs a stochastic search
mechanism to locate high-likelihood activity labels while minimizing exhaustive
enumeration efficiently. We systematically evaluate ProbRes across multiple
openness levels (L0--L3), demonstrating its adaptability to increasing search
space complexity. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art performance on
benchmark datasets (GTEA Gaze, GTEA Gaze+, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charades-Ego), we
establish a clear taxonomy for open-world recognition, delineating the
challenges and methodological advancements necessary for egocentric activity
understanding.

*Hidenobu Matsuki,Gwangbin Bae,Andrew J. Davison*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出首个基于可微分渲染的4D跟踪与建图方法，联合优化相机定位与非刚性表面重建，解决4D-SLAM的高维优化难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然环境中复杂的非刚性运动使4D-SLAM研究不足，现有方法难以处理高维优化空间。

Method: 采用高斯表面基元改进SLAM，结合MLP表示的变形场和新型相机位姿估计技术，提出表面正则化项。

Result: 实现精确的表面重建与非刚性变形建模，并发布首个开放合成数据集支持评估。

Conclusion: 通过新方法和评估协议，推动现代4D-SLAM研究发展。

Abstract: We propose the first 4D tracking and mapping method that jointly performs
camera localization and non-rigid surface reconstruction via differentiable
rendering. Our approach captures 4D scenes from an online stream of color
images with depth measurements or predictions by jointly optimizing scene
geometry, appearance, dynamics, and camera ego-motion. Although natural
environments exhibit complex non-rigid motions, 4D-SLAM remains relatively
underexplored due to its inherent challenges; even with 2.5D signals, the
problem is ill-posed because of the high dimensionality of the optimization
space. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce a SLAM method based on
Gaussian surface primitives that leverages depth signals more effectively than
3D Gaussians, thereby achieving accurate surface reconstruction. To further
model non-rigid deformations, we employ a warp-field represented by a
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and introduce a novel camera pose estimation
technique along with surface regularization terms that facilitate
spatio-temporal reconstruction. In addition to these algorithmic challenges, a
significant hurdle in 4D SLAM research is the lack of reliable ground truth and
evaluation protocols, primarily due to the difficulty of 4D capture using
commodity sensors. To address this, we present a novel open synthetic dataset
of everyday objects with diverse motions, leveraging large-scale object models
and animation modeling. In summary, we open up the modern 4D-SLAM research by
introducing a novel method and evaluation protocols grounded in modern vision
and rendering techniques.

TLDR: CFP-Gen是一种新型扩散语言模型，用于组合功能蛋白质生成，通过整合多模态条件解决现有PLMs无法同时满足多约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PLMs仅能基于单一模态条件生成蛋白质序列，难以同时满足多模态约束。

Method: 引入AGFM模块动态调整蛋白质特征分布，RCFE模块捕获残基间相互作用，并整合3D结构编码器施加几何约束。

Result: CFP-Gen能高效生成功能与天然蛋白质相当的新型蛋白质，并在设计多功能蛋白质时具有高成功率。

Conclusion: CFP-Gen为蛋白质设计提供了高效且多功能的新方法。

Abstract: Existing PLMs generate protein sequences based on a single-condition
constraint from a specific modality, struggling to simultaneously satisfy
multiple constraints across different modalities. In this work, we introduce
CFP-Gen, a novel diffusion language model for Combinatorial Functional Protein
GENeration. CFP-Gen facilitates the de novo protein design by integrating
multimodal conditions with functional, sequence, and structural constraints.
Specifically, an Annotation-Guided Feature Modulation (AGFM) module is
introduced to dynamically adjust the protein feature distribution based on
composable functional annotations, e.g., GO terms, IPR domains and EC numbers.
Meanwhile, the Residue-Controlled Functional Encoding (RCFE) module captures
residue-wise interaction to ensure more precise control. Additionally,
off-the-shelf 3D structure encoders can be seamlessly integrated to impose
geometric constraints. We demonstrate that CFP-Gen enables high-throughput
generation of novel proteins with functionality comparable to natural proteins,
while achieving a high success rate in designing multifunctional proteins. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: SHTC是一种端到端优化的变换编码框架，用于3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）压缩，通过联合优化3DGS、变换和轻量级上下文模型，显著提升了率失真性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS因其快速高质量渲染而流行，但内存占用大，现有神经压缩方法未采用端到端优化的分析-合成变换，导致性能不佳。

Method: SHTC框架包括使用KLT进行数据去相关的基础层和稀疏编码的增强层，增强层通过线性变换和ISTA重建残差。

Result: SHTC显著提升了率失真性能，且参数和计算开销极小。

Conclusion: SHTC是首个端到端优化的3DGS压缩框架，通过可解释设计实现了高性能和低开销。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its fast and
high-quality rendering, but it has a very large memory footprint incurring high
transmission and storage overhead. Recently, some neural compression methods,
such as Scaffold-GS, were proposed for 3DGS but they did not adopt the approach
of end-to-end optimized analysis-synthesis transforms which has been proven
highly effective in neural signal compression. Without an appropriate analysis
transform, signal correlations cannot be removed by sparse representation.
Without such transforms the only way to remove signal redundancies is through
entropy coding driven by a complex and expensive context modeling, which
results in slower speed and suboptimal rate-distortion (R-D) performance. To
overcome this weakness, we propose Sparsity-guided Hierarchical Transform
Coding (SHTC), the first end-to-end optimized transform coding framework for
3DGS compression. SHTC jointly optimizes the 3DGS, transforms and a lightweight
context model. This joint optimization enables the transform to produce
representations that approach the best R-D performance possible. The SHTC
framework consists of a base layer using KLT for data decorrelation, and a
sparsity-coded enhancement layer that compresses the KLT residuals to refine
the representation. The enhancement encoder learns a linear transform to
project high-dimensional inputs into a low-dimensional space, while the decoder
unfolds the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) to reconstruct
the residuals. All components are designed to be interpretable, allowing the
incorporation of signal priors and fewer parameters than black-box transforms.
This novel design significantly improves R-D performance with minimal
additional parameters and computational overhead.

Abstract: We introduce a taxonomy of materials for hierarchical recognition from local
appearance. Our taxonomy is motivated by vision applications and is arranged
according to the physical traits of materials. We contribute a diverse,
in-the-wild dataset with images and depth maps of the taxonomy classes.
Utilizing the taxonomy and dataset, we present a method for hierarchical
material recognition based on graph attention networks. Our model leverages the
taxonomic proximity between classes and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
We demonstrate the model's potential to generalize to adverse, real-world
imaging conditions, and that novel views rendered using the depth maps can
enhance this capability. Finally, we show the model's capacity to rapidly learn
new materials in a few-shot learning setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAD重建方法通常仅支持单一输入模态，限制了通用性和鲁棒性。多模态输入可以提升设计的民主化。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1) 监督微调（SFT）在大规模生成数据上；2) 强化学习（RL）微调，使用在线反馈（如GRPO算法）。

Result: SFT模型在DeepCAD基准测试中优于单模态方法；RL微调后，模型在三个数据集上达到新最优。

Conclusion: 多模态输入结合两阶段训练显著提升CAD重建性能，强化学习微调是关键创新。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a central role in engineering and
manufacturing, making it possible to create precise and editable 3D models.
Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD
reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing
methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds,
images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging
recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD
reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities.
Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage
pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated
data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online
feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL
fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such
as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline
alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing
single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More
importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three
challenging datasets, including a real-world one.

TLDR: 论文提出Re-ttention方法，通过利用扩散模型的时间冗余性，实现高稀疏度的注意力机制，显著降低计算开销，同时保持视觉生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力技术在极高稀疏度下无法保持视觉质量，且可能引入计算开销。

Method: Re-ttention通过基于先验softmax分布历史重塑注意力分数，克服注意力机制中的概率归一化偏移。

Result: 实验表明，Re-ttention仅需3.1%的token，在T2V/T2I模型上优于现有方法，并显著降低延迟。

Conclusion: Re-ttention在极高稀疏度下保持视觉质量，显著提升效率，适用于视觉生成任务。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the de-facto model for generating
high-quality visual content like videos and images. A huge bottleneck is the
attention mechanism where complexity scales quadratically with resolution and
video length. One logical way to lessen this burden is sparse attention, where
only a subset of tokens or patches are included in the calculation. However,
existing techniques fail to preserve visual quality at extremely high sparsity
levels and might even incur non-negligible compute overheads. % To address this
concern, we propose Re-ttention, which implements very high sparse attention
for visual generation models by leveraging the temporal redundancy of Diffusion
Models to overcome the probabilistic normalization shift within the attention
mechanism. Specifically, Re-ttention reshapes attention scores based on the
prior softmax distribution history in order to preserve the visual quality of
the full quadratic attention at very high sparsity levels. % Experimental
results on T2V/T2I models such as CogVideoX and the PixArt DiTs demonstrate
that Re-ttention requires as few as 3.1\% of the tokens during inference,
outperforming contemporary methods like FastDiTAttn, Sparse VideoGen and
MInference. Further, we measure latency to show that our method can attain over
45\% end-to-end % and over 92\% self-attention latency reduction on an H100 GPU
at negligible overhead cost.

Motivation: 探索扩散模型生成的合成图像在生物医学图像分类中的潜在价值，尤其是蛋白质亚细胞定位任务。

Method: 实现简化的类条件去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM），生成标签一致的样本，并通过Mix Loss和Mix Representation两种混合训练策略集成合成数据与真实数据。

Result: 混合方法在验证集上表现良好，但MixModel在未见测试数据上泛化能力差；传统ResNet分类器表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 合成数据的生成需更真实，监督需更鲁棒，才能有效用于生物医学图像分类。

Abstract: We investigate whether synthetic images generated by diffusion models can
enhance multi-label classification of protein subcellular localization.
Specifically, we implement a simplified class-conditional denoising diffusion
probabilistic model (DDPM) to produce label-consistent samples and explore
their integration with real data via two hybrid training strategies: Mix Loss
and Mix Representation. While these approaches yield promising validation
performance, our proposed MixModel exhibits poor generalization to unseen test
data, underscoring the challenges of leveraging synthetic data effectively. In
contrast, baseline classifiers built on ResNet backbones with conventional loss
functions demonstrate greater stability and test-time performance. Our findings
highlight the importance of realistic data generation and robust supervision
when incorporating generative augmentation into biomedical image
classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统中值滤波算法存在对图像位深、滤波器核大小和形状的限制，且方形核易产生条纹伪影。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，支持任意位深、任意核大小和任意凸核形状（包括圆形）。

Result: 该方法高效且无传统算法的限制。

Conclusion: 新方法解决了中值滤波的长期限制，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Median filtering is a cornerstone of computational image processing. It
provides an effective means of image smoothing, with minimal blurring or
softening of edges, invariance to monotonic transformations such as gamma
adjustment, and robustness to noise and outliers. However, known algorithms
have all suffered from practical limitations: the bit depth of the image data,
the size of the filter kernel, or the kernel shape itself. Square-kernel
implementations tend to produce streaky cross-hatching artifacts, and nearly
all known efficient algorithms are in practice limited to square kernels. We
present for the first time a method that overcomes all of these limitations.
Our method operates efficiently on arbitrary bit-depth data, arbitrary kernel
sizes, and arbitrary convex kernel shapes, including circular shapes.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that
seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and
fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior
methods that address these motion types through separate modules or
task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting
user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video
generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify
keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire
object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected
trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally
consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework
demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks,
including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint
changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our
method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality
compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly
compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones. Project

Result: 评估了四种世界模型基线，数据集和代码已开源。

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了空间一致性研究的空白，支持未来世界模型的发展。

Abstract: The ability to simulate the world in a spatially consistent manner is a
crucial requirements for effective world models. Such a model enables
high-quality visual generation, and also ensures the reliability of world
models for downstream tasks such as simulation and planning. Designing a memory
module is a crucial component for addressing spatial consistency: such a model
must not only retain long-horizon observational information, but also enables
the construction of explicit or implicit internal spatial representations.
However, there are no dataset designed to promote the development of memory
modules by explicitly enforcing spatial consistency constraints. Furthermore,
most existing benchmarks primarily emphasize visual coherence or generation
quality, neglecting the requirement of long-range spatial consistency. To
bridge this gap, we construct a dataset and corresponding benchmark by sampling
150 distinct locations within the open-world environment of Minecraft,
collecting about 250 hours (20 million frames) of loop-based navigation videos
with actions. Our dataset follows a curriculum design of sequence lengths,
allowing models to learn spatial consistency on increasingly complex navigation
trajectories. Furthermore, our data collection pipeline is easily extensible to
new Minecraft environments and modules. Four representative world model
baselines are evaluated on our benchmark. Dataset, benchmark, and code are
open-sourced to support future research.

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和方法有效提升了复杂人体运动动画的生成质量，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved conditional
video generation, particularly in the pose-guided human image animation task.
Although existing methods are capable of generating high-fidelity and
time-consistent animation sequences in regular motions and static scenes, there
are still obvious limitations when facing complex human body motions
(Hypermotion) that contain highly dynamic, non-standard motions, and the lack
of a high-quality benchmark for evaluation of complex human motion animations.
To address this challenge, we introduce the \textbf{Open-HyperMotionX Dataset}
and \textbf{HyperMotionX Bench}, which provide high-quality human pose
annotations and curated video clips for evaluating and improving pose-guided
human image animation models under complex human motion conditions.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet powerful DiT-based video generation
baseline and design spatial low-frequency enhanced RoPE, a novel module that
selectively enhances low-frequency spatial feature modeling by introducing
learnable frequency scaling. Our method significantly improves structural
stability and appearance consistency in highly dynamic human motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and proposed
approach in advancing the generation quality of complex human motion image
animations. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中难以获取精确相机姿态，导致几何对齐问题。

Method: SHARE构建姿态感知的规范体积表示，结合多视图信息，并通过锚对齐高斯预测优化局部几何。

Result: 在多样化真实数据集上表现稳健。

Conclusion: SHARE在无需姿态估计的情况下实现了高质量的3D高斯溅射。

Abstract: While generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting enables efficient, high-quality
rendering of unseen scenes, it heavily depends on precise camera poses for
accurate geometry. In real-world scenarios, obtaining accurate poses is
challenging, leading to noisy pose estimates and geometric misalignments. To
address this, we introduce SHARE, a pose-free, feed-forward Gaussian splatting
framework that overcomes these ambiguities by joint shape and camera rays
estimation. Instead of relying on explicit 3D transformations, SHARE builds a
pose-aware canonical volume representation that seamlessly integrates
multi-view information, reducing misalignment caused by inaccurate pose
estimates. Additionally, anchor-aligned Gaussian prediction enhances scene
reconstruction by refining local geometry around coarse anchors, allowing for
more precise Gaussian placement. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world
datasets show that our method achieves robust performance in pose-free
generalizable Gaussian splatting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在多对象视频生成中难以准确捕捉复杂对象交互，且常将对象误认为静态背景或混合特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多对象生成准确性和运动动态上提升了42%，同时保持高保真度和运动平滑性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练，显著提升了现有视频扩散模型的多对象生成能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) models have
demonstrated remarkable progress, but these models still face challenges in
generating videos with multiple objects. Most models struggle with accurately
capturing complex object interactions, often treating some objects as static
background elements and limiting their movement. In addition, they often fail
to generate multiple distinct objects as specified in the prompt, resulting in
incorrect generations or mixed features across objects. In this paper, we
present a novel training-free approach for multi-object video generation that
leverages the open world knowledge of diffusion models and large language
models (LLMs). We use an LLM as the ``director'' of object trajectories, and
apply the trajectories through noise re-initialization to achieve precise
control of realistic movements. We further refine the generation process by
manipulating the attention mechanism to better capture object-specific features
and motion patterns, and prevent cross-object feature interference. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of our training free approach in
significantly enhancing the multi-object generation capabilities of existing
video diffusion models, resulting in 42% absolute improvement in motion
dynamics and object generation accuracy, while also maintaining high fidelity
and motion smoothness.

Abstract: Modern VLMs have achieved near-saturation accuracy in English document visual
question-answering (VQA). However, this task remains challenging in lower
resource languages due to a dearth of suitable training and evaluation data. In
this paper we present scalable methods for curating such datasets by focusing
on Hungarian, approximately the 17th highest resource language on the internet.
Specifically, we present HuDocVQA and HuDocVQA-manual, document VQA datasets
that modern VLMs significantly underperform on compared to English DocVQA.
HuDocVQA-manual is a small manually curated dataset based on Hungarian
documents from Common Crawl, while HuDocVQA is a larger synthetically generated
VQA data set from the same source. We apply multiple rounds of quality
filtering and deduplication to HuDocVQA in order to match human-level quality
in this dataset. We also present HuCCPDF, a dataset of 117k pages from
Hungarian Common Crawl PDFs along with their transcriptions, which can be used
for training a model for Hungarian OCR. To validate the quality of our
datasets, we show how finetuning on a mixture of these datasets can improve
accuracy on HuDocVQA for Llama 3.2 11B Instruct by +7.2%. Our datasets and code
will be released to the public to foster further research in multilingual
DocVQA.

Conclusion: SeG-SR通过引入高层语义知识，显著提升了遥感图像超分辨率的性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in a wide
range of applications, including urban planning and environmental monitoring.
However, due to limitations in sensors and data transmission links, the images
acquired in practice often suffer from resolution degradation. Remote Sensing
Image Super-Resolution (RSISR) aims to reconstruct HR images from
low-resolution (LR) inputs, providing a cost-effective and efficient
alternative to direct HR image acquisition. Existing RSISR methods primarily
focus on low-level characteristics in pixel space, while neglecting the
high-level understanding of remote sensing scenes. This may lead to
semantically inconsistent artifacts in the reconstructed results. Motivated by
this observation, our work aims to explore the role of high-level semantic
knowledge in improving RSISR performance. We propose a Semantic-Guided
Super-Resolution framework, SeG-SR, which leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to extract semantic knowledge from input images and uses it to guide the
super resolution (SR) process. Specifically, we first design a Semantic Feature
Extraction Module (SFEM) that utilizes a pretrained VLM to extract semantic
knowledge from remote sensing images. Next, we propose a Semantic Localization
Module (SLM), which derives a series of semantic guidance from the extracted
semantic knowledge. Finally, we develop a Learnable Modulation Module (LMM)
that uses semantic guidance to modulate the features extracted by the SR
network, effectively incorporating high-level scene understanding into the SR
pipeline. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of SeG-SR through
extensive experiments: SeG-SR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
datasets and consistently delivers performance improvements across various SR
architectures. Codes can be found at https://github.com/Mr-Bamboo/SeG-SR.

Motivation: 传统方法主要关注骨骼序列的动态特征，而忽略了动态与静态关节的交互作用。本文旨在挖掘这种交互作用的判别潜力，以提升动作分类性能。

Method: 提出了STJD测量方法，用于量化动态与静态关节的交互作用，并基于此设计了STJD-CL对比学习策略和STJD-MP方法。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60、NTU RGB+D 120和PKUMMD数据集上的实验表明，STJD-CL和STJD-MP显著提升了性能，尤其在NTU RGB+D 120数据集上分别比现有对比方法提高了3.5和3.6个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过量化动态与静态关节的交互作用，STJD-CL和STJD-MP有效提升了动作分类性能，证明了这种交互作用的判别潜力。

Abstract: Traditional approaches in unsupervised or self supervised learning for
skeleton-based action classification have concentrated predominantly on the
dynamic aspects of skeletal sequences. Yet, the intricate interaction between
the moving and static elements of the skeleton presents a rarely tapped
discriminative potential for action classification. This paper introduces a
novel measurement, referred to as spatial-temporal joint density (STJD), to
quantify such interaction. Tracking the evolution of this density throughout an
action can effectively identify a subset of discriminative moving and/or static
joints termed "prime joints" to steer self-supervised learning. A new
contrastive learning strategy named STJD-CL is proposed to align the
representation of a skeleton sequence with that of its prime joints while
simultaneously contrasting the representations of prime and nonprime joints. In
addition, a method called STJD-MP is developed by integrating it with a
reconstruction-based framework for more effective learning. Experimental
evaluations on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKUMMD datasets in various
downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed STJD-CL and STJD-MP improved
performance, particularly by 3.5 and 3.6 percentage points over the
state-of-the-art contrastive methods on the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset using X-sub
and X-set evaluations, respectively.

Result: 在三个细粒度数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基于LLP的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为隐私保护的细粒度分类提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集将公开以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: In recent years, Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) has achieved
impressive recognition accuracy, despite minimal inter-class variations.
However, existing methods heavily rely on instance-level labels, making them
impractical in privacy-sensitive scenarios such as medical image analysis. This
paper aims to enable accurate fine-grained recognition without direct access to
instance labels. To achieve this, we leverage the Learning from Label
Proportions (LLP) paradigm, which requires only bag-level labels for efficient
training. Unlike existing LLP-based methods, our framework explicitly exploits
the hierarchical nature of fine-grained datasets, enabling progressive feature
granularity refinement and improving classification accuracy. We propose
Learning from Hierarchical Fine-Grained Label Proportions (LHFGLP), a framework
that incorporates Unrolled Hierarchical Fine-Grained Sparse Dictionary
Learning, transforming handcrafted iterative approximation into learnable
network optimization. Additionally, our proposed Hierarchical Proportion Loss
provides hierarchical supervision, further enhancing classification
performance. Experiments on three widely-used fine-grained datasets, structured
in a bag-based manner, demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
existing LLP-based methods. We will release our code and datasets to foster
further research in privacy-preserving fine-grained classification.

Abstract: Deep models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformer (ViT), demonstrate remarkable performance in image classification.
However, those deep models require large data to fine-tune, which is
impractical in the medical domain due to the data privacy issue. Furthermore,
despite the feasible performance of contrastive language image pre-training
(CLIP) in the natural domain, the potential of CLIP has not been fully
investigated in the medical field. To face these challenges, we considered
three scenarios: 1) we introduce a novel CLIP variant using four CNNs and eight
ViTs as image encoders for the classification of brain cancer and skin cancer,
2) we combine 12 deep models with two federated learning techniques to protect
data privacy, and 3) we involve traditional machine learning (ML) methods to
improve the generalization ability of those deep models in unseen domain data.
The experimental results indicate that maxvit shows the highest averaged (AVG)
test metrics (AVG = 87.03\%) in HAM10000 dataset with multimodal learning,
while convnext\_l demonstrates remarkable test with an F1-score of 83.98\%
compared to swin\_b with 81.33\% in FL model. Furthermore, the use of support
vector machine (SVM) can improve the overall test metrics with AVG of $\sim
2\%$ for swin transformer series in ISIC2018. Our codes are available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in unified vision-language models (VLMs), which integrate
both visual understanding and generation capabilities, have attracted
significant attention. The underlying hypothesis is that a unified architecture
with mixed training on both understanding and generation tasks can enable
mutual enhancement between understanding and generation. However, this
hypothesis remains underexplored in prior works on unified VLMs. To address
this gap, this paper systematically investigates the generalization across
understanding and generation tasks in unified VLMs. Specifically, we design a
dataset closely aligned with real-world scenarios to facilitate extensive
experiments and quantitative evaluations. We evaluate multiple unified VLM
architectures to validate our findings. Our key findings are as follows. First,
unified VLMs trained with mixed data exhibit mutual benefits in understanding
and generation tasks across various architectures, and this mutual benefits can
scale up with increased data. Second, better alignment between multimodal input
and output spaces will lead to better generalization. Third, the knowledge
acquired during generation tasks can transfer to understanding tasks, and this
cross-task generalization occurs within the base language model, beyond
modality adapters. Our findings underscore the critical necessity of unifying
understanding and generation in VLMs, offering valuable insights for the design
and optimization of unified VLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法在压缩语义特征时牺牲了表达能力，且像素级预测导致冗余，增加了内存开销。

Result: 实验表明，参数减少了60%，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SpatialSplat通过更紧凑的高斯表示和优化的语义编码，提升了语义3D重建的实用性。

Abstract: A major breakthrough in 3D reconstruction is the feedforward paradigm to
generate pixel-wise 3D points or Gaussian primitives from sparse, unposed
images. To further incorporate semantics while avoiding the significant memory
and storage costs of high-dimensional semantic features, existing methods
extend this paradigm by associating each primitive with a compressed semantic
feature vector. However, these methods have two major limitations: (a) the
naively compressed feature compromises expressiveness, affecting the model's
ability to capture fine-grained semantics, and (b) the pixel-wise primitive
prediction introduces redundancy in overlapping areas, causing unnecessary
memory overhead. To this end, we introduce \textbf{SpatialSplat}, a feedforward
framework that produces redundancy-aware Gaussians and capitalizes on a
dual-field semantic representation. Particularly, with the insight that
primitives within the same instance exhibit high semantic consistency, we
decompose the semantic representation into a coarse feature field that encodes
uncompressed semantics with minimal primitives, and a fine-grained yet
low-dimensional feature field that captures detailed inter-instance
relationships. Moreover, we propose a selective Gaussian mechanism, which
retains only essential Gaussians in the scene, effectively eliminating
redundant primitives. Our proposed Spatialsplat learns accurate semantic
information and detailed instances prior with more compact 3D Gaussians, making
semantic 3D reconstruction more applicable. We conduct extensive experiments to
evaluate our method, demonstrating a remarkable 60\% reduction in scene
representation parameters while achieving superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be made available for future
investigation.

Result: 实验结果表明该框架有效，并基于GQA数据集构建了GQA-MSCG数据集用于评估。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了MSCG领域的空白，提出的框架和数据集为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Compositional generalization is the ability of generalizing novel
compositions from seen primitives, and has received much attention in
vision-and-language (V\&L) recently. Due to the multi-modal nature of V\&L
tasks, the primitives composing compositions source from different modalities,
resulting in multi-sourced novel compositions. However, the generalization
ability over multi-sourced novel compositions, \textit{i.e.}, multi-sourced
compositional generalization (MSCG) remains unexplored. In this paper, we
explore MSCG in the context of visual question answering (VQA), and propose a
retrieval-augmented training framework to enhance the MSCG ability of VQA
models by learning unified representations for primitives from different
modalities. Specifically, semantically equivalent primitives are retrieved for
each primitive in the training samples, and the retrieved features are
aggregated with the original primitive to refine the model. This process helps
the model learn consistent representations for the same semantic primitives
across different modalities. To evaluate the MSCG ability of VQA models, we
construct a new GQA-MSCG dataset based on the GQA dataset, in which samples
include three types of novel compositions composed of primitives from different
modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework. We release GQA-MSCG at https://github.com/NeverMoreLCH/MSCG.

Conclusion: \method通过融合与迭代优化，显著提升了部分视角下的3D重建一致性。

Abstract: Generative 3D reconstruction shows strong potential in incomplete
observations. While sparse-view and single-image reconstruction are
well-researched, partial observation remains underexplored. In this context,
dense views are accessible only from a specific angular range, with other
perspectives remaining inaccessible. This task presents two main challenges:
(i) limited View Range: observations confined to a narrow angular scope prevent
effective traditional interpolation techniques that require evenly distributed
perspectives. (ii) inconsistent Generation: views created for invisible regions
often lack coherence with both visible regions and each other, compromising
reconstruction consistency. To address these challenges, we propose \method, a
novel training-free approach that integrates the local dense observations and
multi-source priors for reconstruction. Our method introduces a fusion-based
strategy to effectively align these priors in DDIM sampling, thereby generating
multi-view consistent images to supervise invisible views. We further design an
iterative refinement strategy, which uses the geometric structures of the
object to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets show the superiority of our method over SOTAs, especially in invisible
regions.

Result: URWKV模型在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且参数和计算资源需求更低。

Conclusion: URWKV通过多状态机制有效解决了动态耦合退化问题，为低光图像处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) and joint LLIE and deblurring
(LLIE-deblur) models have made strides in addressing predefined degradations,
yet they are often constrained by dynamically coupled degradations. To address
these challenges, we introduce a Unified Receptance Weighted Key Value (URWKV)
model with multi-state perspective, enabling flexible and effective degradation
restoration for low-light images. Specifically, we customize the core URWKV
block to perceive and analyze complex degradations by leveraging multiple
intra- and inter-stage states. First, inspired by the pupil mechanism in the
human visual system, we propose Luminance-adaptive Normalization (LAN) that
adjusts normalization parameters based on rich inter-stage states, allowing for
adaptive, scene-aware luminance modulation. Second, we aggregate multiple
intra-stage states through exponential moving average approach, effectively
capturing subtle variations while mitigating information loss inherent in the
single-state mechanism. To reduce the degradation effects commonly associated
with conventional skip connections, we propose the State-aware Selective Fusion
(SSF) module, which dynamically aligns and integrates multi-state features
across encoder stages, selectively fusing contextual information. In comparison
to state-of-the-art models, our URWKV model achieves superior performance on
various benchmarks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and
computational resources.

Conclusion: GeoMan通过创新设计成功解决了3D人体几何估计中的关键挑战，为视频几何估计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and temporally consistent 3D human geometry from videos
is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods, primarily
optimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and
fail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we
present GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and
temporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos.
GeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training
data and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size.
To overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to
estimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then
conditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as
an image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of
geometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role
to focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video
datasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and
generalizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the
challenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth
representation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be
estimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional
affine-invariant and metric depth representations. GeoMan achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding challenges in 3D
human geometry estimation from videos.

Conclusion: LeMoRe为轻量级语义分割提供了一种高效且性能优异的解决方案。

Abstract: Lightweight semantic segmentation is essential for many downstream vision
tasks. Unfortunately, existing methods often struggle to balance efficiency and
performance due to the complexity of feature modeling. Many of these existing
approaches are constrained by rigid architectures and implicit representation
learning, often characterized by parameter-heavy designs and a reliance on
computationally intensive Vision Transformer-based frameworks. In this work, we
introduce an efficient paradigm by synergizing explicit and implicit modeling
to balance computational efficiency with representational fidelity. Our method
combines well-defined Cartesian directions with explicitly modeled views and
implicitly inferred intermediate representations, efficiently capturing global
dependencies through a nested attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on
challenging datasets, including ADE20K, CityScapes, Pascal Context, and
COCO-Stuff, demonstrate that LeMoRe strikes an effective balance between

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于CLIP和强化学习的低光图像增强方法CURVE，通过Bézier曲线调整全局色调，并在高分辨率图像中保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零参考低光图像增强中如何利用CLIP模型获得感知良好的图像，同时保持高分辨率图像的计算效率。

Method: 提出CURVE方法，使用简单的图像处理模块基于Bézier曲线调整全局色调，并通过强化学习迭代估计处理参数，奖励设计利用CLIP文本嵌入。

Result: 在低光和多曝光数据集上的实验表明，CURVE在增强质量和处理速度上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: CURVE通过结合CLIP和强化学习，有效解决了低光图像增强的挑战，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) is crucial for improving both human
perception and computer vision tasks. This paper addresses two challenges in
zero-reference LLIE: obtaining perceptually 'good' images using the Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model and maintaining computational
efficiency for high-resolution images. We propose CLIP-Utilized Reinforcement
learning-based Visual image Enhancement (CURVE). CURVE employs a simple image
processing module which adjusts global image tone based on B\'ezier curve and
estimates its processing parameters iteratively. The estimator is trained by
reinforcement learning with rewards designed using CLIP text embeddings.
Experiments on low-light and multi-exposure datasets demonstrate the
performance of CURVE in terms of enhancement quality and processing speed
compared to conventional methods.

TLDR: 提出EEG Adapter (EAD)框架，解决不同设备采集的EEG信号分类问题，实现高精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EEG分类方法依赖特定设备和通道数，难以统一处理多设备数据，需开发兼容性强的框架。

Method: 基于EEG基础模型改进，提出EAD框架，支持不同设备采集的EEG信号分类。

Result: 在EEG-ImageNet和BrainLat数据集上分别达到99.33%和92.31%的准确率，并展示零样本分类能力。

Conclusion: EAD框架能有效处理多设备EEG数据，具有高精度和泛化性，适用于多种感知任务。

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) has been a popular modality for neural
decoding, it often involves task specific acquisition of the EEG data. This
poses challenges for the development of a unified pipeline to learn embeddings
for various EEG signal classification, which is often involved in various
decoding tasks. Traditionally, EEG classification involves the step of signal
preprocessing and the use of deep learning techniques, which are highly
dependent on the number of EEG channels in each sample. However, the same
pipeline cannot be applied even if the EEG data is collected for the same
experiment but with different acquisition devices. This necessitates the
development of a framework for learning EEG embeddings, which could be highly
beneficial for tasks involving multiple EEG samples for the same task but with
varying numbers of EEG channels. In this work, we propose EEG Adapter (EAD), a
flexible framework compatible with any signal acquisition device. More
specifically, we leverage a recent EEG foundational model with significant
adaptations to learn robust representations from the EEG data for the
classification task. We evaluate EAD on two publicly available datasets
achieving state-of-the-art accuracies 99.33% and 92.31% on EEG-ImageNet and
BrainLat respectively. This illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
framework across diverse EEG datasets containing two different perception
tasks: stimulus and resting-state EEG signals. We also perform zero-shot EEG
classification on EEG-ImageNet task to demonstrate the generalization
capability of the proposed approach.

TLDR: 提出了一种个性化认知测试方案，通过识别个体特定的认知障碍模式，为早期痴呆检测提供高效工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期痴呆检测需要高效且适用于大规模人群的方法，传统测试耗时且难以个性化。

Method: 通过两步法（特征选择和聚类分析）从标准化测试数据中学习认知障碍模式，并应用于个性化测试设计。

Result: 识别出与临床MCI亚型对应的认知障碍模式，可用于预测无症状人群的认知退化路径。

Conclusion: 该方法为痴呆早期检测和个性化干预提供了新思路。

Abstract: Early detection of dementia is crucial to devise effective interventions.
Comprehensive cognitive tests, while being the most accurate means of
diagnosis, are long and tedious, thus limiting their applicability to a large
population, especially when periodic assessments are needed. The problem is
compounded by the fact that people have differing patterns of cognitive
impairment as they progress to different forms of dementia. This paper presents
a novel scheme by which individual-specific patterns of impairment can be
identified and used to devise personalized tests for periodic follow-up.
Patterns of cognitive impairment are initially learned from a population
cluster of combined normals and MCIs, using a set of standardized cognitive
tests. Impairment patterns in the population are identified using a 2-step
procedure involving an ensemble wrapper feature selection followed by cluster
identification and analysis. These patterns have been shown to correspond to
clinically accepted variants of MCI, a prodrome of dementia. The learned
clusters of patterns can subsequently be used to identify the most likely route
of cognitive impairment, even for pre-symptomatic and apparently normal people.
Baseline data of 24,000 subjects from the NACC database was used for the study.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了预测的准确性和实用性，对自动驾驶的下游规划任务具有实际优势。

Abstract: Accurately predicting 3D occupancy grids from visual inputs is critical for
autonomous driving, but current discriminative methods struggle with noisy
data, incomplete observations, and the complex structures inherent in 3D
scenes. In this work, we reframe 3D occupancy prediction as a generative
modeling task using diffusion models, which learn the underlying data
distribution and incorporate 3D scene priors. This approach enhances prediction
consistency, noise robustness, and better handles the intricacies of 3D spatial
structures. Our extensive experiments show that diffusion-based generative
models outperform state-of-the-art discriminative approaches, delivering more
realistic and accurate occupancy predictions, especially in occluded or
low-visibility regions. Moreover, the improved predictions significantly
benefit downstream planning tasks, highlighting the practical advantages of our
method for real-world autonomous driving applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在场景文本图像超分辨率中存在文本区域定位不准确和字符形状建模不足的问题，导致生成质量下降。

Method: TextSR利用文本检测器和OCR提取多语言文本，通过UTF-8编码器和交叉注意力将字符转换为视觉形状，并结合两种创新方法提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在TextZoom和TextVQA数据集上表现优异，为STISR设立了新基准。

Conclusion: TextSR通过整合文本字符先验和低分辨率图像，有效提升了文本超分辨率的细节和可读性。

Abstract: While recent advancements in Image Super-Resolution (SR) using diffusion
models have shown promise in improving overall image quality, their application
to scene text images has revealed limitations. These models often struggle with
accurate text region localization and fail to effectively model image and
multilingual character-to-shape priors. This leads to inconsistencies, the
generation of hallucinated textures, and a decrease in the perceived quality of
the super-resolved text.
  To address these issues, we introduce TextSR, a multimodal diffusion model
specifically designed for Multilingual Scene Text Image Super-Resolution.
TextSR leverages a text detector to pinpoint text regions within an image and
then employs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract multilingual text
from these areas. The extracted text characters are then transformed into
visual shapes using a UTF-8 based text encoder and cross-attention. Recognizing
that OCR may sometimes produce inaccurate results in real-world scenarios, we
have developed two innovative methods to enhance the robustness of our model.
By integrating text character priors with the low-resolution text images, our
model effectively guides the super-resolution process, enhancing fine details
within the text and improving overall legibility. The superior performance of
our model on both the TextZoom and TextVQA datasets sets a new benchmark for
STISR, underscoring the efficacy of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种两阶段网络（MMGT），通过音频、运动掩码和运动特征联合驱动生成同步的语音手势视频，解决了传统方法中因仅依赖音频导致的大幅度手势运动捕捉不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于身体各部分运动的多样性、音频相关性及细节特征的复杂性，仅依赖音频作为控制信号难以捕捉大幅度手势运动，导致视频中出现明显伪影和失真。现有方法通常通过引入额外先验信息解决此问题，但限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出MMGT网络，分两阶段：1）SMGA网络从音频生成高质量姿态视频和运动掩码；2）MM-HAA模块集成到稳定扩散视频生成模型中，解决传统方法在细粒度运动生成和区域细节控制上的局限。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频质量、唇同步和手势生成方面表现更优。

Conclusion: MMGT通过联合驱动信号和两阶段设计，实现了高质量、细节丰富的上半身视频生成，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Co-Speech Gesture Video Generation aims to generate vivid speech videos from
audio-driven still images, which is challenging due to the diversity of
different parts of the body in terms of amplitude of motion, audio relevance,
and detailed features. Relying solely on audio as the control signal often
fails to capture large gesture movements in video, leading to more pronounced
artifacts and distortions. Existing approaches typically address this issue by
introducing additional a priori information, but this can limit the practical
application of the task. Specifically, we propose a Motion Mask-Guided
Two-Stage Network (MMGT) that uses audio, as well as motion masks and motion
features generated from the audio signal to jointly drive the generation of
synchronized speech gesture videos. In the first stage, the Spatial Mask-Guided
Audio Pose Generation (SMGA) Network generates high-quality pose videos and
motion masks from audio, effectively capturing large movements in key regions
such as the face and gestures. In the second stage, we integrate the Motion
Masked Hierarchical Audio Attention (MM-HAA) into the Stabilized Diffusion
Video Generation model, overcoming limitations in fine-grained motion
generation and region-specific detail control found in traditional methods.
This guarantees high-quality, detailed upper-body video generation with
accurate texture and motion details. Evaluations show improved video quality,
lip-sync, and gesture. The model and code are available at

Motivation: 自动驾驶面临多样轨迹生成与最优路径选择的挑战，需要一种既能生成合规轨迹又能通过多维度评分选择最优路径的方法。

Method: HMAD采用BEVFormer和可学习锚定查询生成多样轨迹，并通过模拟监督评分模块评估轨迹的安全性、合规性和舒适性。

Result: HMAD在CVPR 2025测试集上达到44.5%的驾驶分数。

Conclusion: HMAD展示了将轨迹生成与安全评分解耦的优势，为高级自动驾驶提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving faces persistent challenges in both generating
diverse, rule-compliant trajectories and robustly selecting the optimal path
from these options via learned, multi-faceted evaluation. To address these
challenges, we introduce HMAD, a framework integrating a distinctive
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) based trajectory proposal mechanism with learned
multi-criteria scoring. HMAD leverages BEVFormer and employs learnable anchored
queries, initialized from a trajectory dictionary and refined via iterative
offset decoding (inspired by DiffusionDrive), to produce numerous diverse and
stable candidate trajectories. A key innovation, our simulation-supervised
scorer module, then evaluates these proposals against critical metrics
including no at-fault collisions, drivable area compliance, comfortableness,
and overall driving quality (i.e., extended PDM score). Demonstrating its
efficacy, HMAD achieves a 44.5% driving score on the CVPR 2025 private test
set. This work highlights the benefits of effectively decoupling robust
trajectory generation from comprehensive, safety-aware learned scoring for
advanced autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非专业用户依赖的自动化工具缺乏解释深度和交互透明性，无法模拟专业艺术家的创意过程。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和自然语言推理，进行艺术分析、制定修图策略，并通过API输出参数到Lightroom，迭代优化直至达到艺术效果。

Result: 在用户研究中优于现有自动化工具，效果接近专业艺术家水平。

Conclusion: PhotoArtAgent通过透明解释和用户交互，实现了高质量的艺术修图效果。

Abstract: Photo retouching is integral to photographic art, extending far beyond simple
technical fixes to heighten emotional expression and narrative depth. While
artists leverage expertise to create unique visual effects through deliberate
adjustments, non-professional users often rely on automated tools that produce
visually pleasing results but lack interpretative depth and interactive
transparency. In this paper, we introduce PhotoArtAgent, an intelligent system
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with advanced natural language
reasoning to emulate the creative process of a professional artist. The agent
performs explicit artistic analysis, plans retouching strategies, and outputs
precise parameters to Lightroom through an API. It then evaluates the resulting
images and iteratively refines them until the desired artistic vision is
achieved. Throughout this process, PhotoArtAgent provides transparent,
text-based explanations of its creative rationale, fostering meaningful
interaction and user control. Experimental results show that PhotoArtAgent not
only surpasses existing automated tools in user studies but also achieves
results comparable to those of professional human artists.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Zero-to-Hero的参考视频编辑方法，通过分解编辑过程为两个阶段，解决了现有文本引导方法的模糊性和细粒度控制不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导的视频编辑方法存在用户意图模糊和对对象特定编辑控制不足的问题。

Method: 方法分为两个阶段：Zero-Stage通过编辑锚帧作为参考图像，并利用原始帧的对应关系引导注意力机制；Hero-Stage通过条件生成模型修复视频。

Result: 方法在PSNR上比基线方法提高了2.6 dB，并在Blender构建的视频集上验证了外观一致性。

Conclusion: Zero-to-Hero方法通过分阶段处理和条件生成模型，显著提升了视频编辑的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Appearance editing according to user needs is a pivotal task in video
editing. Existing text-guided methods often lead to ambiguities regarding user
intentions and restrict fine-grained control over editing specific aspects of
objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach
named {Zero-to-Hero}, which focuses on reference-based video editing that
disentangles the editing process into two distinct problems. It achieves this
by first editing an anchor frame to satisfy user requirements as a reference
image and then consistently propagating its appearance across other frames. We
leverage correspondence within the original frames to guide the attention
mechanism, which is more robust than previously proposed optical flow or
temporal modules in memory-friendly video generative models, especially when
dealing with objects exhibiting large motions. It offers a solid ZERO-shot
initialization that ensures both accuracy and temporal consistency. However,
intervention in the attention mechanism results in compounded imaging
degradation with over-saturated colors and unknown blurring issues. Starting
from Zero-Stage, our Hero-Stage Holistically learns a conditional generative
model for vidEo RestOration. To accurately evaluate the consistency of the
appearance, we construct a set of videos with multiple appearances using
Blender, enabling a fine-grained and deterministic evaluation. Our method
outperforms the best-performing baseline with a PSNR improvement of 2.6 dB. The

Motivation: 现有医学AI模型简化了诊断推理过程，忽略了临床场景中的多阶段推理，导致与实际情况不符。

Method: 构建CXRTrek数据集，模拟放射科医生的8阶段诊断推理；提出CXRTrekNet模型，整合临床推理流程。

Result: CXRTrekNet在CXRTrek基准测试中表现优异，并在多个外部数据集上展示出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: CXRTrek数据集和模型填补了医学AI在多阶段诊断推理中的空白，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation
assistants have demonstrated significant progress and are increasingly being
applied in clinical settings. However, contemporary medical AI models often
adhere to a simplistic input-to-output paradigm, directly processing an image
and an instruction to generate a result, where the instructions may be integral
to the model's architecture. This approach overlooks the modeling of the
inherent diagnostic reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation. Such reasoning is
typically sequential, where each interpretive stage considers the images, the
current task, and the contextual information from previous stages. This
oversight leads to several shortcomings, including misalignment with clinical
scenarios, contextless reasoning, and untraceable errors. To fill this gap, we
construct CXRTrek, a new multi-stage visual question answering (VQA) dataset
for CXR interpretation. The dataset is designed to explicitly simulate the
diagnostic reasoning process employed by radiologists in real-world clinical
settings for the first time. CXRTrek covers 8 sequential diagnostic stages,
comprising 428,966 samples and over 11 million question-answer (Q&A) pairs,
with an average of 26.29 Q&A pairs per sample. Building on the CXRTrek dataset,
we propose a new vision-language large model (VLLM), CXRTrekNet, specifically
designed to incorporate the clinical reasoning flow into the VLLM framework.
CXRTrekNet effectively models the dependencies between diagnostic stages and
captures reasoning patterns within the radiological context. Trained on our
dataset, the model consistently outperforms existing medical VLLMs on the
CXRTrek benchmarks and demonstrates superior generalization across multiple
tasks on five diverse external datasets. The dataset and model can be found in
our repository (https://github.com/guanjinquan/CXRTrek).

TLDR: FlowAlign提出了一种基于流的无反转图像编辑框架，通过流匹配损失实现更稳定和一致的编辑轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于流的无反转图像编辑方法（如FlowEdit）虽然避免了潜在反转问题，但常导致编辑轨迹不稳定和源图像一致性差。

Method: FlowAlign引入流匹配损失作为正则化机制，平衡编辑提示的语义对齐和源图像的结构一致性，并支持反向编辑。

Result: 实验表明，FlowAlign在源图像保留和编辑可控性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlowAlign通过流匹配损失和可逆ODE轨迹，实现了更稳定和一致的图像编辑。

Abstract: Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit
leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3,
enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation
(ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these
methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source
consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel
inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with
principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a
regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories
during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to
explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural
consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign
naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory,
highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods
in both source preservation and editing controllability.

Conclusion: PreFM为实时多模态视频理解提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Audio-visual event parsing plays a crucial role in understanding multimodal
video content, but existing methods typically rely on offline processing of
entire videos with huge model sizes, limiting their real-time applicability. We
introduce Online Audio-Visual Event Parsing (On-AVEP), a novel paradigm for
parsing audio, visual, and audio-visual events by sequentially analyzing
incoming video streams. The On-AVEP task necessitates models with two key
capabilities: (1) Accurate online inference, to effectively distinguish events
with unclear and limited context in online settings, and (2) Real-time
efficiency, to balance high performance with computational constraints. To
cultivate these, we propose the Predictive Future Modeling (PreFM) framework
featured by (a) predictive multimodal future modeling to infer and integrate
beneficial future audio-visual cues, thereby enhancing contextual understanding
and (b) modality-agnostic robust representation along with focal temporal
prioritization to improve precision and generalization. Extensive experiments
on the UnAV-100 and LLP datasets show PreFM significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly fewer parameters,
offering an insightful approach for real-time multimodal video understanding.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel level-of-detail (LOD) method for 3D Gaussian
Splatting that enables real-time rendering of large-scale scenes on
memory-constrained devices. Our approach introduces a hierarchical LOD
representation that iteratively selects optimal subsets of Gaussians based on
camera distance, thus largely reducing both rendering time and GPU memory
usage. We construct each LOD level by applying a depth-aware 3D smoothing
filter, followed by importance-based pruning and fine-tuning to maintain visual
fidelity. To further reduce memory overhead, we partition the scene into
spatial chunks and dynamically load only relevant Gaussians during rendering,
employing an opacity-blending mechanism to avoid visual artifacts at chunk
boundaries. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both outdoor
(Hierarchical 3DGS) and indoor (Zip-NeRF) datasets, delivering high-quality
renderings with reduced latency and memory requirements.

Result: 实现了文本到图像生成、风格迁移和图像重建等功能，无需修改CLIP权重。

Conclusion: 判别模型可能隐藏着未被发现的生成潜力。

Abstract: CLIP is a discriminative model trained to align images and text in a shared
embedding space. Due to its multimodal structure, it serves as the backbone of
many generative pipelines, where a decoder is trained to map from the shared
space back to images. In this work, we show that image synthesis is
nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or
fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural
representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying
frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we
introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal
Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending
loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's
weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation,
style transfer, and image reconstruction. These findings suggest that
discriminative models may hold untapped generative potential, hidden in plain
sight.

Conclusion: RoboTransfer为机器人数据合成提供了高效且可控的解决方案，显著提升了模仿学习的性能。

Abstract: Imitation Learning has become a fundamental approach in robotic manipulation.
However, collecting large-scale real-world robot demonstrations is
prohibitively expensive. Simulators offer a cost-effective alternative, but the
sim-to-real gap make it extremely challenging to scale. Therefore, we introduce
RoboTransfer, a diffusion-based video generation framework for robotic data
synthesis. Unlike previous methods, RoboTransfer integrates multi-view geometry
with explicit control over scene components, such as background and object
attributes. By incorporating cross-view feature interactions and global
depth/normal conditions, RoboTransfer ensures geometry consistency across
views. This framework allows fine-grained control, including background edits
and object swaps. Experiments demonstrate that RoboTransfer is capable of
generating multi-view videos with enhanced geometric consistency and visual
fidelity. In addition, policies trained on the data generated by RoboTransfer
achieve a 33.3% relative improvement in the success rate in the DIFF-OBJ
setting and a substantial 251% relative improvement in the more challenging
DIFF-ALL scenario. Explore more demos on our project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视觉理解方面表现出色，但在复杂现实场景（如密集人群）中的细粒度感知能力仍有限。

Method: 设计了三种基于规则的奖励模型：1）标准推理奖励，2）方差引导观察奖励，3）加权精确召回奖励，以指导模型逐步理解、观察和决策。

Result: DIP-R1在多种细粒度目标检测数据上显著提升性能，优于现有基线模型和监督微调方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将强化学习融入MLLMs可显著提升其在复杂现实感知任务中的能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant visual
understanding capabilities, yet their fine-grained visual perception in complex
real-world scenarios, such as densely crowded public areas, remains limited.
Inspired by the recent success of reinforcement learning (RL) in both LLMs and
MLLMs, in this paper, we explore how RL can enhance visual perception ability
of MLLMs. Then we develop a novel RL-based framework, Deep Inspection and
Perception with RL (DIP-R1) designed to enhance the visual perception
capabilities of MLLMs, by comprehending complex scenes and looking through
visual instances closely. DIP-R1 guides MLLMs through detailed inspection of
visual scene via three simply designed rule-based reward modelings. First, we
adopt a standard reasoning reward encouraging the model to include three
step-by-step processes: 1) reasoning for understanding visual scenes, 2)
observing for looking through interested but ambiguous regions, and 3)
decision-making for predicting answer. Second, a variance-guided looking reward
is designed to examine uncertain regions for the second observing process. It
explicitly enables the model to inspect ambiguous areas, improving its ability
to mitigate perceptual uncertainties. Third, we model a weighted
precision-recall accuracy reward enhancing accurate decision-making. We explore
its effectiveness across diverse fine-grained object detection data consisting
of challenging real-world environments, such as densely crowded scenes. Built
upon existing MLLMs, DIP-R1 achieves consistent and significant improvement
across various in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. It also outperforms
various existing baseline models and supervised fine-tuning methods. Our
findings highlight the substantial potential of integrating RL into MLLMs for
enhancing capabilities in complex real-world perception tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服装合成任务多关注设计阶段，生产流程研究不足，需填补这一空白。

Method: 提出HiGarment框架，包含多模态语义增强机制和协调交叉注意力机制。

Result: 实验和用户研究验证了HiGarment的有效性，并发布了开源数据集。

Conclusion: HiGarment成功解决了FS2RG任务中的挑战，为服装合成提供了新方法。

Abstract: Diffusion-based garment synthesis tasks primarily focus on the design phase
in the fashion domain, while the garment production process remains largely
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task: Flat Sketch to
Realistic Garment Image (FS2RG), which generates realistic garment images by
integrating flat sketches and textual guidance. FS2RG presents two key
challenges: 1) fabric characteristics are solely guided by textual prompts,
providing insufficient visual supervision for diffusion-based models, which
limits their ability to capture fine-grained fabric details; 2) flat sketches
and textual guidance may provide conflicting information, requiring the model
to selectively preserve or modify garment attributes while maintaining
structural coherence. To tackle this task, we propose HiGarment, a novel
framework that comprises two core components: i) a multi-modal semantic
enhancement mechanism that enhances fabric representation across textual and
visual modalities, and ii) a harmonized cross-attention mechanism that
dynamically balances information from flat sketches and text prompts, allowing
controllable synthesis by generating either sketch-aligned (image-biased) or
text-guided (text-biased) outputs. Furthermore, we collect Multi-modal Detailed
Garment, the largest open-source dataset for garment generation. Experimental
results and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGarment in garment
synthesis. The code and dataset will be released.

Result: 方法在多个T2I模型上验证有效，并在实际对抗性AIGC检测竞赛中排名第一。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅可用于攻击场景，还能构建高质量对抗数据集，提升AIGC检测和防御系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rise of text-to-image (T2I) models has enabled the synthesis of
photorealistic human portraits, raising serious concerns about identity misuse
and the robustness of AIGC detectors. In this work, we propose an automated
adversarial prompt generation framework that leverages a grammar tree structure
and a variant of the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to systematically
explore the semantic prompt space. Our method generates diverse, controllable
prompts that consistently evade both open-source and commercial AIGC detectors.
Extensive experiments across multiple T2I models validate its effectiveness,
and the approach ranked first in a real-world adversarial AIGC detection
competition. Beyond attack scenarios, our method can also be used to construct
high-quality adversarial datasets, providing valuable resources for training
and evaluating more robust AIGC detection and defense systems.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为LANGO的语言引导目标检测框架，用于解决航空图像中因光照和视角变化导致的场景和实例级变化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空图像中的目标检测面临多种变化（如光照和视角）的挑战，导致场景多样性和目标外观变化，增加了定位和识别的难度。

Method: 设计了视觉语义推理器以理解图像场景的语义，并提出关系学习损失来处理实例级变化（如视角和尺度变化）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了检测性能。

Conclusion: LANGO框架通过语言引导学习有效缓解了航空图像中的场景和实例级变化问题。

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in computer vision research, object detection in
aerial images still suffers from several challenges. One primary challenge to
be mitigated is the presence of multiple types of variation in aerial images,
for example, illumination and viewpoint changes. These variations result in
highly diverse image scenes and drastic alterations in object appearance, so
that it becomes more complicated to localize objects from the whole image scene
and recognize their categories. To address this problem, in this paper, we
introduce a novel object detection framework in aerial images, named
LANGuage-guided Object detection (LANGO). Upon the proposed language-guided
learning, the proposed framework is designed to alleviate the impacts from both
scene and instance-level variations. First, we are motivated by the way humans
understand the semantics of scenes while perceiving environmental factors in
the scenes (e.g., weather). Therefore, we design a visual semantic reasoner
that comprehends visual semantics of image scenes by interpreting conditions
where the given images were captured. Second, we devise a training objective,
named relation learning loss, to deal with instance-level variations, such as
viewpoint angle and scale changes. This training objective aims to learn
relations in language representations of object categories, with the help of
the robust characteristics against such variations. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and our
method obtains noticeable detection performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RGB摄像头在低光条件下性能下降的问题，提升ADAS系统的环境感知能力。

Method: WTEFNet包含三个核心模块：低光增强（LLE）、小波特征提取（WFE）和自适应融合检测（AFFD），分别处理图像增强、特征提取和检测融合。

Result: 在BDD100K、SHIFT、nuScenes和GSN数据集上达到最先进精度，并在嵌入式平台上验证了实时性。

Conclusion: WTEFNet在低光条件下表现出色，适合实时ADAS应用，为低光目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection is a cornerstone of environmental perception in advanced
driver assistance systems(ADAS). However, most existing methods rely on RGB
cameras, which suffer from significant performance degradation under low-light
conditions due to poor image quality. To address this challenge, we proposes
WTEFNet, a real-time object detection framework specifically designed for
low-light scenarios, with strong adaptability to mainstream detectors. WTEFNet
comprises three core modules: a Low-Light Enhancement (LLE) module, a
Wavelet-based Feature Extraction (WFE) module, and an Adaptive Fusion Detection
(AFFD) module. The LLE enhances dark regions while suppressing overexposed
areas; the WFE applies multi-level discrete wavelet transforms to isolate high-
and low-frequency components, enabling effective denoising and structural
feature retention; the AFFD fuses semantic and illumination features for robust
detection. To support training and evaluation, we introduce GSN, a manually
annotated dataset covering both clear and rainy night-time scenes. Extensive
experiments on BDD100K, SHIFT, nuScenes, and GSN demonstrate that WTEFNet
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy under low-light conditions. Furthermore,
deployment on a embedded platform (NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin) confirms the
framework's suitability for real-time ADAS applications.

Motivation: 现有方法多将3D数据降维至2D处理，未能充分利用3D数据的潜力，限制了模型学习3D空间特征和生成3D预测的能力。

Method: 提出一种完全基于3D点云的方法，融合多模态数据，使用双分支Transformer模型和跨注意力机制实现特征集成。

Result: 在DFC2018等数据集上验证，3D融合方法性能与2D方法相当，且能生成3D预测，灵活性更高。

Conclusion: 3D融合方法在保持竞争力的同时，提供了更高的灵活性，支持3D预测生成。

Abstract: Multimodal remote sensing data, including spectral and lidar or
photogrammetry, is crucial for achieving satisfactory land-use / land-cover
classification results in urban scenes. So far, most studies have been
conducted in a 2D context. When 3D information is available in the dataset, it
is typically integrated with the 2D data by rasterizing the 3D data into 2D
formats. Although this method yields satisfactory classification results, it
falls short in fully exploiting the potential of 3D data by restricting the
model's ability to learn 3D spatial features directly from raw point clouds.
Additionally, it limits the generation of 3D predictions, as the dimensionality
of the input data has been reduced. In this study, we propose a fully 3D-based
method that fuses all modalities within the 3D point cloud and employs a
dedicated dual-branch Transformer model to simultaneously learn geometric and
spectral features. To enhance the fusion process, we introduce a
cross-attention-based mechanism that fully operates on 3D points, effectively
integrating features from various modalities across multiple scales. The
purpose of cross-attention is to allow one modality to assess the importance of
another by weighing the relevant features. We evaluated our method by comparing
it against both 3D and 2D methods using the 2018 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest
(DFC2018) dataset. Our findings indicate that 3D fusion delivers competitive
results compared to 2D methods and offers more flexibility by providing 3D
predictions. These predictions can be projected onto 2D maps, a capability that
is not feasible in reverse. Additionally, we evaluated our method on different
datasets, specifically the ISPRS Vaihingen 3D and the IEEE 2019 Data Fusion
Contest. Our code will be published here:

TLDR: FlexMerge是一种无需数据的新型模型合并框架，通过灵活生成不同大小的合并模型，平衡精度与模型大小的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单模型合并精度不足与多模型部署成本高的问题。

Method: 将微调模型视为顺序块集合，逐步合并，支持多种合并算法。

Result: 实验显示，稍大的合并模型能显著提升精度，适用于多种部署场景。

Conclusion: FlexMerge提供了一种灵活、高效且无需数据的解决方案。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient method to combine multiple
single-task fine-tuned models. The merged model can enjoy multi-task
capabilities without expensive training. While promising, merging into a single
model often suffers from an accuracy gap with respect to individual fine-tuned
models. On the other hand, deploying all individual fine-tuned models incurs
high costs. We propose FlexMerge, a novel data-free model merging framework to
flexibly generate merged models of varying sizes, spanning the spectrum from a
single merged model to retaining all individual fine-tuned models. FlexMerge
treats fine-tuned models as collections of sequential blocks and progressively
merges them using any existing data-free merging method, halting at a desired
size. We systematically explore the accuracy-size trade-off exhibited by
different merging algorithms in combination with FlexMerge. Extensive
experiments on vision and NLP benchmarks, with up to 30 tasks, reveal that even
modestly larger merged models can provide substantial accuracy improvements
over a single model. By offering fine-grained control over fused model size,
FlexMerge provides a flexible, data-free, and high-performance solution for
diverse deployment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测在军事和预警应用中至关重要，但现有深度学习方法存在信息丢失和全局上下文建模效率低的问题。

Method: 提出SAMamba框架，包括FS-Adapter用于域适应、CSI模块用于高效全局建模、DPCF模块用于多尺度特征融合。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在复杂背景和多尺度目标场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: SAMamba通过创新模块解决了红外小目标检测的核心挑战，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is vital for long-range surveillance
in military, maritime, and early warning applications. ISTD is challenged by
targets occupying less than 0.15% of the image and low distinguishability from
complex backgrounds. Existing deep learning methods often suffer from
information loss during downsampling and inefficient global context modeling.
This paper presents SAMamba, a novel framework integrating SAM2's hierarchical
feature learning with Mamba's selective sequence modeling. Key innovations
include: (1) A Feature Selection Adapter (FS-Adapter) for efficient
natural-to-infrared domain adaptation via dual-stage selection (token-level
with a learnable task embedding and channel-wise adaptive transformations); (2)
A Cross-Channel State-Space Interaction (CSI) module for efficient global
context modeling with linear complexity using selective state space modeling;
and (3) A Detail-Preserving Contextual Fusion (DPCF) module that adaptively
combines multi-scale features with a gating mechanism to balance
high-resolution and low-resolution feature contributions. SAMamba addresses
core ISTD challenges by bridging the domain gap, maintaining fine-grained
details, and efficiently modeling long-range dependencies. Experiments on
NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and NUDT-SIRST datasets show SAMamba significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with
heterogeneous backgrounds and varying target scales. Code:

Motivation: 现有方法依赖UV映射修复纹理，存在拓扑模糊性问题，UniTEX旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 1. 提出Texture Functions (TFs)在3D空间中生成纹理；2. 使用基于Transformer的Large Texturing Model (LTM)从图像和几何输入预测TFs；3. 采用LoRA策略优化Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)用于多视图纹理合成。

Result: 实验表明UniTEX在视觉质量和纹理完整性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniTEX为自动化3D纹理生成提供了通用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present UniTEX, a novel two-stage 3D texture generation framework to
create high-quality, consistent textures for 3D assets. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on UV-based inpainting to refine textures after reprojecting
the generated multi-view images onto the 3D shapes, which introduces challenges
related to topological ambiguity. To address this, we propose to bypass the
limitations of UV mapping by operating directly in a unified 3D functional
space. Specifically, we first propose that lifts texture generation into 3D
space via Texture Functions (TFs)--a continuous, volumetric representation that
maps any 3D point to a texture value based solely on surface proximity,
independent of mesh topology. Then, we propose to predict these TFs directly
from images and geometry inputs using a transformer-based Large Texturing Model
(LTM). To further enhance texture quality and leverage powerful 2D priors, we
develop an advanced LoRA-based strategy for efficiently adapting large-scale
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for high-quality multi-view texture synthesis as
our first stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTEX achieves
superior visual quality and texture integrity compared to existing approaches,
offering a generalizable and scalable solution for automated 3D texture
generation. Code will available in: https://github.com/YixunLiang/UniTEX.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在图像筛选任务中表现不佳，主要由于缺乏数据和美学推理能力不足。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 收集了包含1500+样本的医学图像数据集，并提出了DPA-GRPO方法（基于动态比例准确度奖励的组相对策略优化）来增强MLLMs的美学推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，现有顶级闭源MLLMs（如GPT-4o和Qwen-VL-Max）在美学推理任务中表现接近随机猜测，而本文方法通过小模型超越了这些大模型的性能。

Conclusion: 本文的研究为图像美学推理提供了一种新配置，未来有望成为医学图像筛选的常规方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are of great application across many
domains, such as multimodal understanding and generation. With the development
of diffusion models (DM) and unified MLLMs, the performance of image generation
has been significantly improved, however, the study of image screening is rare
and its performance with MLLMs is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and
the week image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a
complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology.
For data, we collect a comprehensive medical image screening dataset with 1500+
samples, each sample consists of a medical image, four generated images, and a
multiple-choice answer. The dataset evaluates the aesthetic reasoning ability
under four aspects: \textit{(1) Appearance Deformation, (2) Principles of
Physical Lighting and Shadow, (3) Placement Layout, (4) Extension Rationality}.
For methodology, we utilize long chains of thought (CoT) and Group Relative
Policy Optimization with Dynamic Proportional Accuracy reward, called DPA-GRPO,
to enhance the image aesthetic reasoning ability of MLLMs. Our experimental
results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT-4o
and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic
reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the reinforcement learning approach, we
are able to surpass the score of both large-scale models and leading
closed-source models using a much smaller model. We hope our attempt on medical
image screening will serve as a regular configuration in image aesthetic
reasoning in the future.

Motivation: 视频消费是日常生活的重要组成部分，但观看完整视频可能繁琐。现有方法未将视频帧和转录文本结合在强化学习框架中。

Method: 提出多模态管道，结合视频帧和转录文本，通过强化学习训练模型生成多样化且具代表性的摘要和高光片段。

Result: 实验表明，结合转录文本的视频摘要和高光检测优于仅依赖视觉内容的方法。

Conclusion: 多模态强化学习框架有效提升了视频摘要和高光检测的性能，且无需标注数据。

Abstract: Video consumption is a key part of daily life, but watching entire videos can
be tedious. To address this, researchers have explored video summarization and
highlight detection to identify key video segments. While some works combine
video frames and transcripts, and others tackle video summarization and
highlight detection using Reinforcement Learning (RL), no existing work, to the
best of our knowledge, integrates both modalities within an RL framework. In
this paper, we propose a multimodal pipeline that leverages video frames and
their corresponding transcripts to generate a more condensed version of the
video and detect highlights using a modality fusion mechanism. The pipeline is
trained within an RL framework, which rewards the model for generating diverse
and representative summaries while ensuring the inclusion of video segments
with meaningful transcript content. The unsupervised nature of the training
allows for learning from large-scale unannotated datasets, overcoming the
challenge posed by the limited size of existing annotated datasets. Our
experiments show that using the transcript in video summarization and highlight
detection achieves superior results compared to relying solely on the visual
content of the video.

Result: LADA在持续学习任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LADA提供了一种高效且性能优越的持续学习方法，避免了参数选择错误和灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Continual learning with vision-language models like CLIP offers a pathway
toward scalable machine learning systems by leveraging its transferable
representations. Existing CLIP-based methods adapt the pre-trained image
encoder by adding multiple sets of learnable parameters, with each task using a
partial set of parameters. This requires selecting the expected parameters for
input images during inference, which is prone to error that degrades
performance. To address this problem, we introduce LADA (Label-specific
ADApter). Instead of partitioning parameters across tasks, LADA appends
lightweight, label-specific memory units to the frozen CLIP image encoder,
enabling discriminative feature generation by aggregating task-agnostic
knowledge. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, LADA employs feature
distillation for seen classes, preventing their features from being interfered
with by new classes. Positioned after the image encoder, LADA prevents gradient
flow to the frozen CLIP parameters, ensuring efficient training. Extensive
results show that LADA achieves state-of-the-art performance in continual
learning settings. The implementation code is available at
https://github.com/MaolinLuo/LADA.

Motivation: 质疑当前假设，即感知能力等同于理解能力，提出MLMs可能仅通过算法规则处理视觉输入，而非真正理解意图。

Method: 引入双层次评估框架（感知与认知），并构建高质量多模态讽刺数据集，评估8种SoTA MLMs。

Result: MLMs在感知任务表现良好，但在讽刺理解上平均错误率16.1%，揭示感知与理解的显著差距。

Conclusion: 支持“视觉房间”论点，为MLMs提供新评估范式，强调情感推理、常识推断和上下文对齐的不足。

Abstract: Can multi-modal large models (MLMs) that can ``see'' an image be said to
``understand'' it? Drawing inspiration from Searle's Chinese Room, we propose
the \textbf{Visual Room} argument: a system may process and describe every
detail of visual inputs by following algorithmic rules, without genuinely
comprehending the underlying intention. This dilemma challenges the prevailing
assumption that perceptual mastery implies genuine understanding. In
implementation, we introduce a two-tier evaluation framework spanning
perception and cognition. The perception component evaluates whether MLMs can
accurately capture the surface-level details of visual contents, where the
cognitive component examines their ability to infer sarcasm polarity. To
support this framework, We further introduce a high-quality multi-modal sarcasm
dataset comprising both 924 static images and 100 dynamic videos. All sarcasm
labels are annotated by the original authors and verified by independent
reviewers to ensure clarity and consistency. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art
(SoTA) MLMs. Our results highlight three key findings: (1) MLMs perform well on
perception tasks; (2) even with correct perception, models exhibit an average
error rate of ~16.1\% in sarcasm understanding, revealing a significant gap
between seeing and understanding; (3) error analysis attributes this gap to
deficiencies in emotional reasoning, commonsense inference, and context
alignment. This work provides empirical grounding for the proposed Visual Room
argument and offers a new evaluation paradigm for MLMs.

Conclusion: MixGS为大规模3D场景重建提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案，适用于单GPU训练。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting have shown remarkable potential for
novel view synthesis. However, most existing large-scale scene reconstruction
methods rely on the divide-and-conquer paradigm, which often leads to the loss
of global scene information and requires complex parameter tuning due to scene
partitioning and local optimization. To address these limitations, we propose
MixGS, a novel holistic optimization framework for large-scale 3D scene
reconstruction. MixGS models the entire scene holistically by integrating
camera pose and Gaussian attributes into a view-aware representation, which is
decoded into fine-detailed Gaussians. Furthermore, a novel mixing operation
combines decoded and original Gaussians to jointly preserve global coherence
and local fidelity. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes demonstrate
that MixGS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and competitive speed,
while significantly reducing computational requirements, enabling large-scale
scene reconstruction training on a single 24GB VRAM GPU. The code will be
released at https://github.com/azhuantou/MixGS.

Result: 实验表明，当前方法对扩散模型伪造的遥感图像检测效果有限，而基于RSFAKE-1M训练的模型表现出更好的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RSFAKE-1M为遥感图像伪造检测领域的研究提供了重要基础，推动了下一代检测方法的发展。

Abstract: Detecting forged remote sensing images is becoming increasingly critical, as
such imagery plays a vital role in environmental monitoring, urban planning,
and national security. While diffusion models have emerged as the dominant
paradigm for image generation, their impact on remote sensing forgery detection
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks primarily target GAN-based forgeries
or focus on natural images, limiting progress in this critical domain. To
address this gap, we introduce RSFAKE-1M, a large-scale dataset of 500K forged
and 500K real remote sensing images. The fake images are generated by ten
diffusion models fine-tuned on remote sensing data, covering six generation
conditions such as text prompts, structural guidance, and inpainting. This
paper presents the construction of RSFAKE-1M along with a comprehensive
experimental evaluation using both existing detectors and unified baselines.
The results reveal that diffusion-based remote sensing forgeries remain
challenging for current methods, and that models trained on RSFAKE-1M exhibit
notably improved generalization and robustness. Our findings underscore the
importance of RSFAKE-1M as a foundation for developing and evaluating
next-generation forgery detection approaches in the remote sensing domain. The

TLDR: GenCAD-Self-Repairing通过扩散引导和自我修复流程，显著提高了生成CAD模型的可行性，将不可行设计的三分之二转化为可行设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenCAD在生成CAD文件时存在约10%的不可行边界表示问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用扩散引导的潜在空间去噪过程和基于回归的修正机制，优化不可行的CAD命令序列。

Result: 成功将基线方法中三分之二的不可行设计转化为可行设计，同时保持几何精度。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了生成CAD模型的可行性，扩展了高质量训练数据的可用性，增强了AI驱动CAD生成在制造、建筑和产品设计中的适用性。

Abstract: With the advancement of generative AI, research on its application to 3D
model generation has gained traction, particularly in automating the creation
of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files from images. GenCAD is a notable model in
this domain, leveraging an autoregressive transformer-based architecture with a
contrastive learning framework to generate CAD programs.
  However, a major limitation of GenCAD is its inability to consistently
produce feasible boundary representations (B-reps), with approximately 10% of
generated designs being infeasible. To address this, we propose
GenCAD-Self-Repairing, a framework that enhances the feasibility of generative
CAD models through diffusion guidance and a self-repairing pipeline. This
framework integrates a guided diffusion denoising process in the latent space
and a regression-based correction mechanism to refine infeasible CAD command
sequences while preserving geometric accuracy. Our approach successfully
converted two-thirds of infeasible designs in the baseline method into feasible
ones, significantly improving the feasibility rate while simultaneously
maintaining a reasonable level of geometric accuracy between the point clouds
of ground truth models and generated models.
  By significantly improving the feasibility rate of generating CAD models, our
approach helps expand the availability of high-quality training data and
enhances the applicability of AI-driven CAD generation in manufacturing,
architecture, and product design.

TLDR: FUSS框架首次实现完全去中心化、无标签的语义图像分割训练，通过联邦学习策略优化特征和原型空间的一致性，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索联邦学习在无监督语义图像分割中的应用，解决分布式客户端特征和聚类中心对齐的难题。

Method: 提出FUSS框架，结合局部分割头和共享语义中心，优化特征和原型空间的全局一致性。

Result: 在基准和真实数据集上，FUSS在多种数据分布下优于局部训练和传统联邦学习算法。

Conclusion: FUSS为无监督语义分割提供了一种高效的联邦学习解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This work explores the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Unsupervised
Semantic image Segmentation (USS). Recent USS methods extract pixel-level
features using frozen visual foundation models and refine them through
self-supervised objectives that encourage semantic grouping. These features are
then grouped to semantic clusters to produce segmentation masks. Extending
these ideas to federated settings requires feature representation and cluster
centroid alignment across distributed clients -- an inherently difficult task
under heterogeneous data distributions in the absence of supervision. To
address this, we propose FUSS Federated Unsupervised image Semantic
Segmentation) which is, to our knowledge, the first framework to enable fully
decentralized, label-free semantic segmentation training. FUSS introduces novel
federation strategies that promote global consistency in feature and prototype
space, jointly optimizing local segmentation heads and shared semantic
centroids. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including
binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, show that FUSS consistently
outperforms local-only client trainings as well as extensions of classical FL
algorithms under varying client data distributions. To support reproducibility,
full code will be released upon manuscript acceptance.

*Finn Carter*

TLDR: TRACE是一种新方法，用于从扩散模型中擦除特定概念，同时保持生成质量。它结合了理论框架和微调程序，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型中生成不良内容（如色情、敏感身份、版权风格）的问题，确保隐私、公平和安全。

Method: TRACE通过理论框架和微调程序，修改交叉注意力层并引入轨迹感知目标，在采样后期阶段避开目标概念。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TRACE在擦除效果和输出质量上优于现有方法（如ANT、EraseAnything、MACE）。

Conclusion: TRACE是一种高效的概念擦除方法，适用于多种扩散模型，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown unprecedented generative
capability, but their ability to produce undesirable concepts
(e.g.~pornographic content, sensitive identities, copyrighted styles) poses
serious concerns for privacy, fairness, and safety. {Concept erasure} aims to
remove or suppress specific concept information in a generative model. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{TRACE (Trajectory-Constrained Attentional Concept
Erasure)}, a novel method to erase targeted concepts from diffusion models
while preserving overall generative quality. Our approach combines a rigorous
theoretical framework, establishing formal conditions under which a concept can
be provably suppressed in the diffusion process, with an effective fine-tuning
procedure compatible with both conventional latent diffusion (Stable Diffusion)
and emerging rectified flow models (e.g.~FLUX). We first derive a closed-form
update to the model's cross-attention layers that removes hidden
representations of the target concept. We then introduce a trajectory-aware
finetuning objective that steers the denoising process away from the concept
only in the late sampling stages, thus maintaining the model's fidelity on
unrelated content. Empirically, we evaluate TRACE on multiple benchmarks used
in prior concept erasure studies (object classes, celebrity faces, artistic
styles, and explicit content from the I2P dataset). TRACE achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent methods such as ANT,
EraseAnything, and MACE in terms of removal efficacy and output quality.

Motivation: 尽管PAR在深度学习推动下取得进展，但其潜在脆弱性和抗干扰能力尚未充分研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于CLIP的PAR框架，采用多模态Transformer融合视觉和文本特征，通过对抗语义和标签扰动生成噪声，并设计防御策略。

Result: 在数字和物理领域的多个数据集上验证了攻击和防御策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的ASL-PAR框架为PAR的对抗攻击与防御提供了有效解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is an indispensable task in
human-centered research and has made great progress in recent years with the
development of deep neural networks. However, the potential vulnerability and
anti-interference ability have still not been fully explored. To bridge this
gap, this paper proposes the first adversarial attack and defense framework for
pedestrian attribute recognition. Specifically, we exploit both global- and
patch-level attacks on the pedestrian images, based on the pre-trained
CLIP-based PAR framework. It first divides the input pedestrian image into
non-overlapping patches and embeds them into feature embeddings using a
projection layer. Meanwhile, the attribute set is expanded into sentences using
prompts and embedded into attribute features using a pre-trained CLIP text
encoder. A multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fuse the obtained vision and
text tokens, and a feed-forward network is utilized for attribute recognition.
Based on the aforementioned PAR framework, we adopt the adversarial semantic
and label-perturbation to generate the adversarial noise, termed ASL-PAR. We
also design a semantic offset defense strategy to suppress the influence of
adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on both digital domains
(i.e., PETA, PA100K, MSP60K, RAPv2) and physical domains fully validated the
effectiveness of our proposed adversarial attack and defense strategies for the
pedestrian attribute recognition. The source code of this paper will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR.

Method: 提出DRA-Ctrl方法，通过混合过渡策略解决视频帧与图像生成的差异，并改进注意力结构和掩码机制以对齐文本提示与图像控制。

Conclusion: DRA-Ctrl为资源密集型视频模型的重用提供了新思路，并为跨视觉模态的统一生成模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Video generative models can be regarded as world simulators due to their
ability to capture dynamic, continuous changes inherent in real-world
environments. These models integrate high-dimensional information across
visual, temporal, spatial, and causal dimensions, enabling predictions of
subjects in various status. A natural and valuable research direction is to
explore whether a fully trained video generative model in high-dimensional
space can effectively support lower-dimensional tasks such as controllable
image generation. In this work, we propose a paradigm for video-to-image
knowledge compression and task adaptation, termed \textit{Dimension-Reduction
Attack} (\texttt{DRA-Ctrl}), which utilizes the strengths of video models,
including long-range context modeling and flatten full-attention, to perform
various generation tasks. Specially, to address the challenging gap between
continuous video frames and discrete image generation, we introduce a
mixup-based transition strategy that ensures smooth adaptation. Moreover, we
redesign the attention structure with a tailored masking mechanism to better
align text prompts with image-level control. Experiments across diverse image
generation tasks, such as subject-driven and spatially conditioned generation,
show that repurposed video models outperform those trained directly on images.
These results highlight the untapped potential of large-scale video generators
for broader visual applications. \texttt{DRA-Ctrl} provides new insights into
reusing resource-intensive video models and lays foundation for future unified
generative models across visual modalities. The project page is

Motivation: 探索如何通过强化学习微调预训练生成模型，以更精确地符合人类偏好，特别是在视觉自回归模型中实现风格控制和图像质量提升。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）微调视觉自回归（VAR）模型，结合CLIP嵌入和美学预测器生成奖励信号。

Result: 实验证明该方法能显著提升图像质量，实现风格控制，并扩展模型生成能力至预训练数据分布之外。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的微调方法对VAR模型高效且有效，尤其适合在线采样，优于扩散模型。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained generative models with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
has emerged as an effective approach for aligning outputs more closely with
nuanced human preferences. In this paper, we investigate the application of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune next-scale visual
autoregressive (VAR) models. Our empirical results demonstrate that this
approach enables alignment to intricate reward signals derived from aesthetic
predictors and CLIP embeddings, significantly enhancing image quality and
enabling precise control over the generation style. Interestingly, by
leveraging CLIP, our method can help VAR models generalize beyond their initial
ImageNet distribution: through RL-driven exploration, these models can generate
images aligned with prompts referencing image styles that were absent during
pre-training. In summary, we show that RL-based fine-tuning is both efficient
and effective for VAR models, benefiting particularly from their fast inference
speeds, which are advantageous for online sampling, an aspect that poses
significant challenges for diffusion-based alternatives.

Motivation: 全切片图像（WSIs）因其超高分辨率和丰富语义内容对癌症诊断至关重要，但大尺寸和细粒度标注稀缺限制了传统监督学习的应用。

Method: 提出DSAGL框架，结合教师-学生架构和双流设计，使用VSSMamba编码器建模长程依赖，FASA模块增强诊断相关区域注意力，并引入混合损失确保双流一致性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、NCT-CRC和TCGA-Lung数据集上，DSAGL优于现有MIL基线，表现出更高的判别性能和弱监督下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DSAGL通过双流注意力引导学习有效解决了WSIs的弱监督分类问题，为癌症诊断提供了新工具。

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) are critical for cancer diagnosis due to their
ultra-high resolution and rich semantic content. However, their massive size
and the limited availability of fine-grained annotations pose substantial
challenges for conventional supervised learning. We propose DSAGL (Dual-Stream
Attention-Guided Learning), a novel weakly supervised classification framework
that combines a teacher-student architecture with a dual-stream design. DSAGL
explicitly addresses instance-level ambiguity and bag-level semantic
consistency by generating multi-scale attention-based pseudo labels and guiding
instance-level learning. A shared lightweight encoder (VSSMamba) enables
efficient long-range dependency modeling, while a fusion-attentive module
(FASA) enhances focus on sparse but diagnostically relevant regions. We further
introduce a hybrid loss to enforce mutual consistency between the two streams.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, NCT-CRC, and TCGA-Lung datasets demonstrate that DSAGL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL baselines, achieving superior
discriminative performance and robustness under weak supervision.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为CFG-Rejection的高效方法，通过分析去噪轨迹中的累积分数差异（ASD）来提前过滤低质量样本，无需外部奖励信号或模型重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中存在样本质量不一致的问题，现有方法（如DDPO和推理时对齐技术）计算成本高且依赖外部奖励信号，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 通过发现样本分布高密度区域与条件/无条件分数累积差异（ASD）的强相关性，提出CFG-Rejection方法，在去噪早期阶段过滤低质量样本。

Result: 实验证明CFG-Rejection在图像生成中显著提升了人类偏好分数（HPSv2, PickScore）和挑战性基准（GenEval, DPG-Bench）的表现。

Conclusion: CFG-Rejection是一种高效、即插即用的策略，兼容现有扩散框架，有望在多种生成模态中实现更高效可靠的高质量样本生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models often exhibit inconsistent sample quality due to stochastic
variations inherent in their sampling trajectories. Although training-based
fine-tuning (e.g. DDPO [1]) and inference-time alignment techniques[2] aim to
improve sample fidelity, they typically necessitate full denoising processes
and external reward signals. This incurs substantial computational costs,
hindering their broader applicability. In this work, we unveil an intriguing
phenomenon: a previously unobserved yet exploitable link between sample quality
and characteristics of the denoising trajectory during classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Specifically, we identify a strong correlation between high-density
regions of the sample distribution and the Accumulated Score Differences
(ASD)--the cumulative divergence between conditional and unconditional scores.
Leveraging this insight, we introduce CFG-Rejection, an efficient,
plug-and-play strategy that filters low-quality samples at an early stage of
the denoising process, crucially without requiring external reward signals or
model retraining. Importantly, our approach necessitates no modifications to
model architectures or sampling schedules and maintains full compatibility with
existing diffusion frameworks. We validate the effectiveness of CFG-Rejection
in image generation through extensive experiments, demonstrating marked
improvements on human preference scores (HPSv2, PickScore) and challenging
benchmarks (GenEval, DPG-Bench). We anticipate that CFG-Rejection will offer
significant advantages for diverse generative modalities beyond images, paving
the way for more efficient and reliable high-quality sample generation.

TLDR: Flow Matching (FM) 框架通过向量场将样本从源分布传输到目标分布。传统方法使用随机耦合导致路径交叉，而基于最优传输（OT）的方法虽减少交叉但未考虑模型偏好。本文提出模型对齐耦合（MAC），结合几何距离和模型预测误差优化耦合选择，显著提升生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FM方法使用随机耦合导致路径交叉和低效轨迹，而基于OT的方法虽减少交叉但未与模型偏好对齐，导致学习困难。因此，需一种新方法优化耦合选择。

Method: 提出模型对齐耦合（MAC），通过结合几何距离和模型预测误差选择最优耦合，并采用top-$k$策略减少计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，MAC在少步生成中显著优于现有方法，提升生成质量和效率。

Conclusion: MAC通过优化耦合选择，解决了传统方法的局限性，为高效生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) is an effective framework for training a model to learn a
vector field that transports samples from a source distribution to a target
distribution. To train the model, early FM methods use random couplings, which
often result in crossing paths and lead the model to learn non-straight
trajectories that require many integration steps to generate high-quality
samples. To address this, recent methods adopt Optimal Transport (OT) to
construct couplings by minimizing geometric distances, which helps reduce path
crossings. However, we observe that such geometry-based couplings do not
necessarily align with the model's preferred trajectories, making it difficult
to learn the vector field induced by these couplings, which prevents the model
from learning straight trajectories. Motivated by this, we propose
Model-Aligned Coupling (MAC), an effective method that matches training
couplings based not only on geometric distance but also on alignment with the
model's preferred transport directions based on its prediction error. To avoid
the time-costly match process, MAC proposes to select the top-$k$ fraction of
couplings with the lowest error for training. Extensive experiments show that
MAC significantly improves generation quality and efficiency in few-step
settings compared to existing methods. Project page:

Abstract: Generating informative and knowledge-rich image captions remains a challenge
for many existing captioning models, which often produce generic descriptions
that lack specificity and contextual depth. To address this limitation, we
propose KRCapVLM, a knowledge replay-based novel image captioning framework
using vision-language model. We incorporate beam search decoding to generate
more diverse and coherent captions. We also integrate attention-based modules
into the image encoder to enhance feature representation. Finally, we employ
training schedulers to improve stability and ensure smoother convergence during
training. These proposals accelerate substantial gains in both caption quality
and knowledge recognition. Our proposed model demonstrates clear improvements
in both the accuracy of knowledge recognition and the overall quality of
generated captions. It shows a stronger ability to generalize to previously
unseen knowledge concepts, producing more informative and contextually relevant
descriptions. These results indicate the effectiveness of our approach in
enhancing the model's capacity to generate meaningful, knowledge-grounded
captions across a range of scenarios.

Method: 设计VideoReasonBench基准，包含视觉丰富且高复杂度的视频推理任务，评估18种多模态大语言模型。

Result: 多数模型表现不佳（如GPT-4o准确率仅6.9%），Gemini-2.5-Pro以56.0%显著领先；扩展思维预算对性能提升关键。

Conclusion: VideoReasonBench揭示了复杂视频推理的挑战，扩展思维预算是提升模型性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on
complex tasks. However, this benefit is yet to be demonstrated in the domain of
video understanding, since most existing benchmarks lack the reasoning depth
required to demonstrate the advantages of extended CoT chains. While recent
efforts have proposed benchmarks aimed at video reasoning, the tasks are often
knowledge-driven and do not rely heavily on visual content. To bridge this gap,
we introduce VideoReasonBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate vision-centric,
complex video reasoning. To ensure visual richness and high reasoning
complexity, each video in VideoReasonBench depicts a sequence of fine-grained
operations on a latent state that is only visible in part of the video. The
questions evaluate three escalating levels of video reasoning skills: recalling
observed visual information, inferring the content of latent states, and
predicting information beyond the video. Under such task setting, models have
to precisely recall multiple operations in the video, and perform step-by-step
reasoning to get correct final answers for these questions. Using
VideoReasonBench, we comprehensively evaluate 18 state-of-the-art multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs), finding that most perform poorly on complex video reasoning,
e.g., GPT-4o achieves only 6.9% accuracy, while the thinking-enhanced
Gemini-2.5-Pro significantly outperforms others with 56.0% accuracy. Our
investigations on "test-time scaling" further reveal that extended thinking
budget, while offering none or minimal benefits on existing video benchmarks,
is essential for improving the performance on VideoReasonBench.

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，MCFNet在分类准确率上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: MCFNet能有效建模跨模态的细微语义，适用于高精度分类任务。

Abstract: Multimodal information processing has become increasingly important for
enhancing image classification performance. However, the intricate and implicit
dependencies across different modalities often hinder conventional methods from
effectively capturing fine-grained semantic interactions, thereby limiting
their applicability in high-precision classification tasks. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Multimodal Collaborative Fusion Network (MCFNet)
designed for fine-grained classification. The proposed MCFNet architecture
incorporates a regularized integrated fusion module that improves intra-modal
feature representation through modality-specific regularization strategies,
while facilitating precise semantic alignment via a hybrid attention mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a multimodal decision classification module, which
jointly exploits inter-modal correlations and unimodal discriminative features
by integrating multiple loss functions within a weighted voting paradigm.
Extensive experiments and ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the proposed MCFNet framework achieves consistent improvements in
classification accuracy, confirming its effectiveness in modeling subtle
cross-modal semantics.

TLDR: PAN-Crafter通过模态一致性对齐框架解决PAN和MS图像融合中的跨模态不对齐问题，显著提升HRMS图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态不对齐（由传感器位置、采集时间和分辨率差异引起）导致传统深度学习方法在融合时出现光谱失真和模糊。

Method: 提出Modality-Adaptive Reconstruction（MARs）联合重建HRMS和PAN图像，并引入Cross-Modality Alignment-Aware Attention（CM3A）双向对齐特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，推理速度快50.11倍，内存占用减少0.63倍，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: PAN-Crafter通过模态对齐和自适应特征优化，显著提升了PAN-sharpening的性能和效率。

Abstract: PAN-sharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multi-spectral (MS) images to generate high-resolution
multi-spectral (HRMS) outputs. However, cross-modality misalignment -- caused
by sensor placement, acquisition timing, and resolution disparity -- induces a
fundamental challenge. Conventional deep learning methods assume perfect
pixel-wise alignment and rely on per-pixel reconstruction losses, leading to
spectral distortion, double edges, and blurring when misalignment is present.
To address this, we propose PAN-Crafter, a modality-consistent alignment
framework that explicitly mitigates the misalignment gap between PAN and MS
modalities. At its core, Modality-Adaptive Reconstruction (MARs) enables a
single network to jointly reconstruct HRMS and PAN images, leveraging PAN's
high-frequency details as auxiliary self-supervision. Additionally, we
introduce Cross-Modality Alignment-Aware Attention (CM3A), a novel mechanism
that bidirectionally aligns MS texture to PAN structure and vice versa,
enabling adaptive feature refinement across modalities. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PAN-Crafter outperforms the
most recent state-of-the-art method in all metrics, even with 50.11$\times$
faster inference time and 0.63$\times$ the memory size. Furthermore, it
demonstrates strong generalization performance on unseen satellite datasets,
showing its robustness across different conditions.

*Weijia Mao,Zhenheng Yang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: UniRL是一种自改进的后训练方法，无需外部图像数据，通过模型自身生成的图像进行训练，同时提升生成和理解任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态大语言模型依赖大规模数据和计算资源，且后训练方法常需外部数据或局限于特定任务。UniRL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用自生成图像作为训练数据，结合监督微调（SFT）和Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）优化模型，实现生成和理解任务的相互增强。

Result: 在Show-o和Janus上评估，GenEval得分分别为0.77和0.65，显示任务性能提升且不平衡性降低。

Conclusion: UniRL提供了一种高效、自给自足的后训练方法，显著减少对外部数据的依赖，同时提升多模态任务性能。

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models such as Show-o and Janus have
achieved strong performance across both generation and understanding tasks.
However, these models typically rely on large-scale datasets and require
substantial computation during the pretraining stage. In addition, several
post-training methods have been proposed, but they often depend on external
data or are limited to task-specific customization. In this work, we introduce
UniRL, a self-improving post-training approach. Our approach enables the model
to generate images from prompts and use them as training data in each
iteration, without relying on any external image data. Moreover, it enables the
two tasks to enhance each other: the generated images are used for
understanding, and the understanding results are used to supervise generation.
We explore supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to optimize the models. UniRL offers three key advantages: (1) it
requires no external image data, as all training samples are generated by the
model itself during training; (2) it not only improves individual task
performance, but also reduces the imbalance between generation and
understanding; and (3) it requires only several additional training steps
during the post-training stage. We evaluate UniRL on top of Show-o and Janus,
achieving a GenEval score of 0.77 for Show-o and 0.65 for Janus. Code and
models will be released in https://github.com/showlab/UniRL.

TLDR: 论文提出VModA框架，用于检测复杂语义的NSFW内容，显著提升检测准确率，并解决跨平台和地区的监管差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NSFW内容在社交媒体上泛滥，现有检测方法难以应对复杂语义和跨平台监管差异，亟需更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出VModA框架，适应多样化监管规则，处理复杂语义的NSFW内容，并通过实验验证其性能。

Result: VModA显著优于现有方法，准确率提升达54.3%，并展示出跨类别和场景的强适应性。

Conclusion: VModA为NSFW内容检测提供了高效且适应性强的解决方案，同时修正了公共数据集中的标注问题。

Abstract: Not Safe/Suitable for Work (NSFW) content is rampant on social networks and
poses serious harm to citizens, especially minors. Current detection methods
mainly rely on deep learning-based image recognition and classification.
However, NSFW images are now presented in increasingly sophisticated ways,
often using image details and complex semantics to obscure their true nature or
attract more views. Although still understandable to humans, these images often
evade existing detection methods, posing a significant threat. Further
complicating the issue, varying regulations across platforms and regions create
additional challenges for effective moderation, leading to detection bias and
reduced accuracy. To address this, we propose VModA, a general and effective
framework that adapts to diverse moderation rules and handles complex,
semantically rich NSFW content across categories. Experimental results show
that VModA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 54.3%
accuracy improvement across NSFW types, including those with complex semantics.
Further experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits strong adaptability
across categories, scenarios, and base VLMs. We also identified inconsistent
and controversial label samples in public NSFW benchmark datasets, re-annotated
them, and submitted corrections to the original maintainers. Two datasets have
confirmed the updates so far. Additionally, we evaluate VModA in real-world
scenarios to demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

*Yun-Cheng Tsai*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种结合YOLOv11n检测器和FUSegNet分割模型的轻量级流程，仅需500个标注框即可实现跨部位伤口分割，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型（如FUSegNet）在非足部伤口上泛化能力不足，需高效且轻量的解决方案。

Method: 结合YOLOv11n检测器和预训练FUSegNet，无需像素级标注或微调，仅需500个标注框。

Result: 在多个测试集上，平均IoU提升23%，DESIGN-R尺寸估计准确率从71%提升至94%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需任务特定微调，仅需少量标注即可实现高效伤口分割，支持临床自动化应用。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate wound segmentation is essential for automated DESIGN-R
scoring. However, existing models such as FUSegNet, which are trained primarily
on foot ulcer datasets, often fail to generalize to wounds on other body sites.
  Methods: We propose an annotation-efficient pipeline that combines a
lightweight YOLOv11n-based detector with the pre-trained FUSegNet segmentation
model. Instead of relying on pixel-level annotations or retraining for new
anatomical regions, our method achieves robust performance using only 500
manually labeled bounding boxes. This zero fine-tuning approach effectively
bridges the domain gap and enables direct deployment across diverse wound
types. This is an advance not previously demonstrated in the wound segmentation
literature.
  Results: Evaluated on three real-world test sets spanning foot, sacral, and
trochanter wounds, our YOLO plus FUSegNet pipeline improved mean IoU by 23
percentage points over vanilla FUSegNet and increased end-to-end DESIGN-R size
estimation accuracy from 71 percent to 94 percent (see Table 3 for details).
  Conclusion: Our pipeline generalizes effectively across body sites without
task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating that minimal supervision, with 500
annotated ROIs, is sufficient for scalable, annotation-light wound
segmentation. This capability paves the way for real-world DESIGN-R automation,
reducing reliance on pixel-wise labeling, streamlining documentation workflows,
and supporting objective and consistent wound scoring in clinical practice. We
will publicly release the trained detector weights and configuration to promote
reproducibility and facilitate downstream deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAD图纸符号识别方法依赖图像栅格化、图构建或点基表示，存在高计算成本、泛化性差和几何信息丢失问题。

Method: 提出VecFormer，采用线基表示原始图元，保留几何连续性；引入分支融合细化模块整合实例与语义预测。

Result: 实验表明VecFormer达到91.1 PQ，Stuff-PQ分别提升9.6和21.2分，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 线基表示是矢量图形理解的有效基础，VecFormer在全景符号识别中表现卓越。

Abstract: We study the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which involves identifying
both individual instances of countable things and the semantic regions of
uncountable stuff in computer-aided design (CAD) drawings composed of vector
graphical primitives. Existing methods typically rely on image rasterization,
graph construction, or point-based representation, but these approaches often
suffer from high computational costs, limited generality, and loss of geometric
structural information. In this paper, we propose VecFormer, a novel method
that addresses these challenges through line-based representation of
primitives. This design preserves the geometric continuity of the original
primitive, enabling more accurate shape representation while maintaining a
computation-friendly structure, making it well-suited for vector graphic
understanding tasks. To further enhance prediction reliability, we introduce a
Branch Fusion Refinement module that effectively integrates instance and
semantic predictions, resolving their inconsistencies for more coherent
panoptic outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes
a new state-of-the-art, achieving 91.1 PQ, with Stuff-PQ improved by 9.6 and
21.2 points over the second-best results under settings with and without prior
information, respectively, highlighting the strong potential of line-based
representation as a foundation for vector graphic understanding.

Method: 利用预训练的基础模型，仅训练Bridging Gate，结合Attention Temperature Scaling技术平衡注意力机制。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在复杂场景中处理重叠物体和精细结构。

Conclusion: BriGeS通过高效融合几何和语义信息，显著提升了MDE的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: We present Bridging Geometric and Semantic (BriGeS), an effective method that
fuses geometric and semantic information within foundation models to enhance
Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE). Central to BriGeS is the Bridging Gate, which
integrates the complementary strengths of depth and segmentation foundation
models. This integration is further refined by our Attention Temperature
Scaling technique. It finely adjusts the focus of the attention mechanisms to
prevent over-concentration on specific features, thus ensuring balanced
performance across diverse inputs. BriGeS capitalizes on pre-trained foundation
models and adopts a strategy that focuses on training only the Bridging Gate.
This method significantly reduces resource demands and training time while
maintaining the model's ability to generalize effectively. Extensive
experiments across multiple challenging datasets demonstrate that BriGeS
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in MDE for complex scenes, effectively
handling intricate structures and overlapping objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉配音方法在无缝集成到原始场景或保留复杂视觉信息（如遮挡和光照变化）方面存在局限。

Method: EdiDub将视觉配音重新定义为内容感知编辑任务，采用专用条件方案保留原始视频上下文。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，EdiDub显著提升了身份保留和同步性，人类评估也显示其同步性和视觉自然性得分更高。

Conclusion: 内容感知编辑方法在保持复杂视觉元素的同时确保唇同步准确性方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: Visual dubbing, the synchronization of facial movements with new speech, is
crucial for making content accessible across different languages, enabling
broader global reach. However, current methods face significant limitations.
Existing approaches often generate talking faces, hindering seamless
integration into original scenes, or employ inpainting techniques that discard
vital visual information like partial occlusions and lighting variations. This
work introduces EdiDub, a novel framework that reformulates visual dubbing as a
content-aware editing task. EdiDub preserves the original video context by
utilizing a specialized conditioning scheme to ensure faithful and accurate
modifications rather than mere copying. On multiple benchmarks, including a
challenging occluded-lip dataset, EdiDub significantly improves identity
preservation and synchronization. Human evaluations further confirm its
superiority, achieving higher synchronization and visual naturalness scores
compared to the leading methods. These results demonstrate that our
content-aware editing approach outperforms traditional generation or
inpainting, particularly in maintaining complex visual elements while ensuring
accurate lip synchronization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法在训练相机分布外的视图合成表现不佳，限制了城市重建的通用性。

Method: 利用部分可观察场景重建粗粒度语义几何基元，结合3D边界框增强对象细节，提出HSG-VSD方法整合语义几何约束。

Result: 定性和定量实验验证了UrbanCraft在外推视图合成问题上的有效性。

Conclusion: UrbanCraft通过分层表示和HSG-VSD方法显著提升了外推视图合成的性能。

Abstract: Existing neural rendering-based urban scene reconstruction methods mainly
focus on the Interpolated View Synthesis (IVS) setting that synthesizes from
views close to training camera trajectory. However, IVS can not guarantee the
on-par performance of the novel view outside the training camera distribution
(\textit{e.g.}, looking left, right, or downwards), which limits the
generalizability of the urban reconstruction application. Previous methods have
optimized it via image diffusion, but they fail to handle text-ambiguous or
large unseen view angles due to coarse-grained control of text-only diffusion.
In this paper, we design UrbanCraft, which surmounts the Extrapolated View
Synthesis (EVS) problem using hierarchical sem-geometric representations
serving as additional priors. Specifically, we leverage the partially
observable scene to reconstruct coarse semantic and geometric primitives,
establishing a coarse scene-level prior through an occupancy grid as the base
representation. Additionally, we incorporate fine instance-level priors from 3D
bounding boxes to enhance object-level details and spatial relationships.
Building on this, we propose the \textbf{H}ierarchical
\textbf{S}emantic-Geometric-\textbf{G}uided Variational Score Distillation
(HSG-VSD), which integrates semantic and geometric constraints from pretrained
UrbanCraft2D into the score distillation sampling process, forcing the
distribution to be consistent with the observable scene. Qualitative and
quantitative comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on EVS
problem.

Motivation: 现有强增强方法主要关注强度扰动，对语义掩码影响较小，而空间增强在SSSS中被忽视。作者认为空间增强也能提升SSSS模型训练效果。

Method: 提出自适应空间增强策略（ASAug），基于熵动态调整每张图像的增强方式，解决弱增强与强增强间掩码不一致问题。

Result: ASAug作为可插拔模块，显著提升现有方法性能，在PASCAL VOC 2012、Cityscapes和COCO等基准数据集上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 空间增强在半监督语义分割中有效，自适应策略进一步优化性能，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS), data augmentation plays a
crucial role in the weak-to-strong consistency regularization framework, as it
enhances diversity and improves model generalization. Recent strong
augmentation methods have primarily focused on intensity-based perturbations,
which have minimal impact on the semantic masks. In contrast, spatial
augmentations like translation and rotation have long been acknowledged for
their effectiveness in supervised semantic segmentation tasks, but they are
often ignored in SSSS. In this work, we demonstrate that spatial augmentation
can also contribute to model training in SSSS, despite generating inconsistent
masks between the weak and strong augmentations. Furthermore, recognizing the
variability among images, we propose an adaptive augmentation strategy that
dynamically adjusts the augmentation for each instance based on entropy.
Extensive experiments show that our proposed Adaptive Spatial Augmentation
(\textbf{ASAug}) can be integrated as a pluggable module, consistently
improving the performance of existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art
results on benchmark datasets such as PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and COCO.

Conclusion: VITON-DRR通过非刚性配准和自适应合成，显著提升了虚拟试穿的质量和细节保留能力。

Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on aims to fit a target garment to a specific person
image and has attracted extensive research attention because of its huge
application potential in the e-commerce and fashion industries. To generate
high-quality try-on results, accurately warping the clothing item to fit the
human body plays a significant role, as slight misalignment may lead to
unrealistic artifacts in the fitting image. Most existing methods warp the
clothing by feature matching and thin-plate spline (TPS). However, it often
fails to preserve clothing details due to self-occlusion, severe misalignment
between poses, etc. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a detail
retention virtual try-on method via accurate non-rigid registration (VITON-DRR)
for diverse human poses. Specifically, we reconstruct a human semantic
segmentation using a dual-pyramid-structured feature extractor. Then, a novel
Deformation Module is designed for extracting the cloth key points and warping
them through an accurate non-rigid registration algorithm. Finally, the Image
Synthesis Module is designed to synthesize the deformed garment image and
generate the human pose information adaptively. {Compared with} traditional
methods, the proposed VITON-DRR can make the deformation of fitting images more
accurate and retain more garment details. The experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method performs better than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CryoCCD为冷冻电镜数据合成提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了分析性能。

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) offers near-atomic resolution imaging of
macromolecules, but developing robust models for downstream analysis is
hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. While synthetic data
generation has emerged as a potential solution, existing methods often fail to
capture both the structural diversity of biological specimens and the complex,
spatially varying noise inherent in cryo-EM imaging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that integrates
biophysical modeling with generative techniques. Specifically, CryoCCD produces
multi-scale cryo-EM micrographs that reflect realistic biophysical variability
through compositional heterogeneity, cellular context, and physics-informed
imaging. To generate realistic noise, we employ a conditional diffusion model,
enhanced by cycle consistency to preserve structural fidelity and mask-aware
contrastive learning to capture spatially adaptive noise patterns. Extensive
experiments show that CryoCCD generates structurally accurate micrographs and
enhances performance in downstream tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in both particle picking and reconstruction.

Motivation: 现有两阶段SGG框架存在虚假相关性，导致预测偏差（如尾关系被预测为首关系、前景关系被预测为背景关系）。

Method: 提出RcSGG框架，包括主动反向估计（ARE）和最大信息采样（MIS），以干预混杂变量并增强反向因果估计。

Result: 在多个基准测试和SGG框架中实现了最先进的平均召回率。

Conclusion: RcSGG有效消除了SGG框架中的虚假相关性，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Existing two-stage Scene Graph Generation (SGG) frameworks typically
incorporate a detector to extract relationship features and a classifier to
categorize these relationships; therefore, the training paradigm follows a
causal chain structure, where the detector's inputs determine the classifier's
inputs, which in turn influence the final predictions. However, such a causal
chain structure can yield spurious correlations between the detector's inputs
and the final predictions, i.e., the prediction of a certain relationship may
be influenced by other relationships. This influence can induce at least two
observable biases: tail relationships are predicted as head ones, and
foreground relationships are predicted as background ones; notably, the latter
bias is seldom discussed in the literature. To address this issue, we propose
reconstructing the causal chain structure into a reverse causal structure,
wherein the classifier's inputs are treated as the confounder, and both the
detector's inputs and the final predictions are viewed as causal variables.
Specifically, we term the reconstructed causal paradigm as the Reverse causal
Framework for SGG (RcSGG). RcSGG initially employs the proposed Active Reverse
Estimation (ARE) to intervene on the confounder to estimate the reverse
causality, \ie the causality from final predictions to the classifier's inputs.
Then, the Maximum Information Sampling (MIS) is suggested to enhance the
reverse causality estimation further by considering the relationship
information. Theoretically, RcSGG can mitigate the spurious correlations
inherent in the SGG framework, subsequently eliminating the induced biases.
Comprehensive experiments on popular benchmarks and diverse SGG frameworks show
the state-of-the-art mean recall rate.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了LAFR的高效性和高质量恢复能力，训练时间减少70%。

Conclusion: LAFR提供了一种高效、高质量的人脸恢复方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Blind face restoration from low-quality (LQ) images is a challenging task
that requires not only high-fidelity image reconstruction but also the
preservation of facial identity. While diffusion models like Stable Diffusion
have shown promise in generating high-quality (HQ) images, their VAE modules
are typically trained only on HQ data, resulting in semantic misalignment when
encoding LQ inputs. This mismatch significantly weakens the effectiveness of LQ
conditions during the denoising process. Existing approaches often tackle this
issue by retraining the VAE encoder, which is computationally expensive and
memory-intensive. To address this limitation efficiently, we propose LAFR
(Latent Alignment for Face Restoration), a novel codebook-based latent space
adapter that aligns the latent distribution of LQ images with that of HQ
counterparts, enabling semantically consistent diffusion sampling without
altering the original VAE. To further enhance identity preservation, we
introduce a multi-level restoration loss that combines constraints from
identity embeddings and facial structural priors. Additionally, by leveraging
the inherent structural regularity of facial images, we show that lightweight
finetuning of diffusion prior on just 0.9% of FFHQ dataset is sufficient to
achieve results comparable to state-of-the-art methods, reduce training time by
70%. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world face restoration
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LAFR, achieving
high-quality, identity-preserving face reconstruction from severely degraded
inputs.

Result: 实验表明，基于AURC的损失函数在多种数据集和模型架构上均表现出竞争力的校准性能。

Conclusion: 优化正则化AURC能有效改善模型校准性能，而焦点损失在校准目标下可能不够理论化。

Abstract: Several variants of reweighted risk functionals, such as focal losss, inverse
focal loss, and the Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC), have been
proposed in the literature and claims have been made in relation to their
calibration properties. However, focal loss and inverse focal loss propose
vastly different weighting schemes. In this paper, we revisit a broad class of
weighted risk functions commonly used in deep learning and establish a
principled connection between these reweighting schemes and calibration errors.
We show that minimizing calibration error is closely linked to the selective
classification paradigm and demonstrate that optimizing a regularized variant
of the AURC naturally leads to improved calibration. This regularized AURC
shares a similar reweighting strategy with inverse focal loss, lending support
to the idea that focal loss is less principled when calibration is a desired
outcome. Direct AURC optimization offers greater flexibility through the choice
of confidence score functions (CSFs). To enable gradient-based optimization, we
introduce a differentiable formulation of the regularized AURC using the
SoftRank technique. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our AURC-based loss
achieves competitive class-wise calibration performance across a range of
datasets and model architectures.

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，尤其在现有方法难以处理的大规模非封闭场景中。

Conclusion: DACPO为大规模非封闭点云定向提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Orienting point clouds is a fundamental problem in computer graphics and 3D
vision, with applications in reconstruction, segmentation, and analysis. While
significant progress has been made, existing approaches mainly focus on
watertight, object-level 3D models. The orientation of large-scale,
non-watertight 3D scenes remains an underexplored challenge. To address this
gap, we propose DACPO (Divide-And-Conquer Point Orientation), a novel framework
that leverages a divide-and-conquer strategy for scalable and robust point
cloud orientation. Rather than attempting to orient an unbounded scene at once,
DACPO segments the input point cloud into smaller, manageable blocks, processes
each block independently, and integrates the results through a global
optimization stage. For each block, we introduce a two-step process: estimating
initial normal orientations by a randomized greedy method and refining them by
an adapted iterative Poisson surface reconstruction. To achieve consistency
across blocks, we model inter-block relationships using an an undirected graph,
where nodes represent blocks and edges connect spatially adjacent blocks. To
reliably evaluate orientation consistency between adjacent blocks, we introduce
the concept of the visible connected region, which defines the region over
which visibility-based assessments are performed. The global integration is
then formulated as a 0-1 integer-constrained optimization problem, with block
flip states as binary variables. Despite the combinatorial nature of the
problem, DACPO remains scalable by limiting the number of blocks (typically a
few hundred for 3D scenes) involved in the optimization. Experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate DACPO's strong performance, particularly in
challenging large-scale, non-watertight scenarios where existing methods often

*Ron Shapira Weber,Shahar Ben Ishay,Andrey Lavrinenko,Shahaf E. Finder,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: TimePoint是一种自监督方法，通过从合成数据中学习关键点和描述符，显著加速DTW对齐并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态时间规整（DTW）在时间序列对齐中存在可扩展性差和对噪声敏感的问题，需要一种更高效且鲁棒的方法。

Method: TimePoint利用1D微分同胚生成合成数据，结合全卷积和小波卷积架构提取关键点和描述符，稀疏化表示后应用DTW。

Result: TimePoint在速度和准确性上均优于标准DTW，且仅用合成数据训练即可泛化到真实时间序列。

Conclusion: TimePoint为时间序列分析提供了一种可扩展的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Fast and scalable alignment of time series is a fundamental challenge in many
domains. The standard solution, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), struggles with poor
scalability and sensitivity to noise. We introduce TimePoint, a self-supervised
method that dramatically accelerates DTW-based alignment while typically
improving alignment accuracy by learning keypoints and descriptors from
synthetic data. Inspired by 2D keypoint detection but carefully adapted to the
unique challenges of 1D signals, TimePoint leverages efficient 1D
diffeomorphisms, which effectively model nonlinear time warping, to generate
realistic training data. This approach, along with fully convolutional and
wavelet convolutional architectures, enables the extraction of informative
keypoints and descriptors. Applying DTW to these sparse representations yield
major speedups and typically higher alignment accuracy than standard DTW
applied to the full signals. TimePoint demonstrates strong generalization to
real-world time series when trained solely on synthetic data, and further
improves with fine-tuning on real data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TimePoint consistently achieves faster and more accurate alignments than
standard DTW, making it a scalable solution for time-series analysis. Our code

TLDR: PhysicsNeRF是一个基于物理的3D重建框架，通过四种约束改进NeRF，在稀疏视图下表现优异，平均PSNR达21.4 dB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准NeRF在稀疏视图下表现不佳的问题，提供物理一致的3D表示。

Method: 结合深度排序、RegNeRF一致性、稀疏先验和跨视图对齐四种约束，采用0.67M参数的紧凑架构。

Result: 仅用8视图实现21.4 dB平均PSNR，优于现有方法，并揭示了稀疏重建的局限性。

Conclusion: PhysicsNeRF为稀疏视图3D重建提供了物理一致且通用的解决方案，并阐明了约束NeRF模型的表达力与泛化能力的权衡。

Abstract: PhysicsNeRF is a physically grounded framework for 3D reconstruction from
sparse views, extending Neural Radiance Fields with four complementary
constraints: depth ranking, RegNeRF-style consistency, sparsity priors, and
cross-view alignment. While standard NeRFs fail under sparse supervision,
PhysicsNeRF employs a compact 0.67M-parameter architecture and achieves 21.4 dB
average PSNR using only 8 views, outperforming prior methods. A generalization
gap of 5.7-6.2 dB is consistently observed and analyzed, revealing fundamental
limitations of sparse-view reconstruction. PhysicsNeRF enables physically
consistent, generalizable 3D representations for agent interaction and
simulation, and clarifies the expressiveness-generalization trade-off in
constrained NeRF models.

TLDR: 论文提出了VCapsBench，首个大规模细粒度视频字幕评估基准，包含5K+视频和100K+ QA对，旨在提升文本到视频生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在细粒度评估上不足，特别是对视频生成关键的空间-时间细节捕捉不足。

Method: 引入VCapsBench，包含5,677视频和109,796 QA对，覆盖21个细粒度维度，并提出AR、IR、CR三个指标及基于LLM的自动化评估流程。

Result: 通过对比QA对分析验证字幕质量，为字幕优化提供可操作建议。

Conclusion: VCapsBench能推动鲁棒的文本到视频模型发展，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Video captions play a crucial role in text-to-video generation tasks, as
their quality directly influences the semantic coherence and visual fidelity of
the generated videos. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) have
demonstrated significant potential in caption generation, existing benchmarks
inadequately address fine-grained evaluation, particularly in capturing
spatial-temporal details critical for video generation. To address this gap, we
introduce the Fine-grained Video Caption Evaluation Benchmark (VCapsBench), the
first large-scale fine-grained benchmark comprising 5,677 (5K+) videos and
109,796 (100K+) question-answer pairs. These QA-pairs are systematically
annotated across 21 fine-grained dimensions (e.g., camera movement, and shot
type) that are empirically proven critical for text-to-video generation. We
further introduce three metrics (Accuracy (AR), Inconsistency Rate (IR),
Coverage Rate (CR)), and an automated evaluation pipeline leveraging large
language model (LLM) to verify caption quality via contrastive QA-pairs
analysis. By providing actionable insights for caption optimization, our
benchmark can advance the development of robust text-to-video models. The
dataset and codes are available at website: https://github.com/GXYM/VCapsBench.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: R2I-Bench是一个专门评估文本到图像生成中推理能力的基准测试，包含多类推理任务，并设计了细粒度评估指标R2IScore。实验表明当前模型推理能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在推理能力上表现不足且缺乏系统评估，需填补这一空白。

Method: 提出R2I-Bench基准和R2IScore评估指标，涵盖多类推理任务，并通过实验验证16种代表性模型。

Result: 实验显示当前模型在推理任务上表现有限，需改进架构。

Conclusion: 下一代文本到图像系统需更注重推理能力的提升。

Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental capability often required in real-world
text-to-image (T2I) generation, e.g., generating ``a bitten apple that has been
left in the air for more than a week`` necessitates understanding temporal
decay and commonsense concepts. While recent T2I models have made impressive
progress in producing photorealistic images, their reasoning capability remains
underdeveloped and insufficiently evaluated. To bridge this gap, we introduce
R2I-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess
reasoning-driven T2I generation. R2I-Bench comprises meticulously curated data
instances, spanning core reasoning categories, including commonsense,
mathematical, logical, compositional, numerical, causal, and concept mixing. To
facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we design R2IScore, a QA-style metric based
on instance-specific, reasoning-oriented evaluation questions that assess three
critical dimensions: text-image alignment, reasoning accuracy, and image
quality. Extensive experiments with 16 representative T2I models, including a
strong pipeline-based framework that decouples reasoning and generation using
the state-of-the-art language and image generation models, demonstrate
consistently limited reasoning performance, highlighting the need for more
robust, reasoning-aware architectures in the next generation of T2I systems.

TLDR: VAU-R1是一个基于多模态大语言模型的数据高效框架，通过强化微调提升视频异常推理能力，并提出了首个视频异常推理基准VAU-Bench。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频异常理解在智能城市、安全监控等应用中至关重要，但现有方法缺乏可解释性且难以捕捉异常事件的因果和上下文关系。

Method: 采用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和强化微调（RFT）构建VAU-R1框架，并设计VAU-Bench基准，包含多选QA、详细解释、时间标注和描述性标题。

Result: 实验表明，VAU-R1显著提高了问答准确性、时间定位和推理连贯性。

Conclusion: VAU-R1和VAU-Bench为可解释和推理感知的视频异常理解奠定了基础。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) is essential for applications such as smart
cities, security surveillance, and disaster alert systems, yet remains
challenging due to its demand for fine-grained spatio-temporal perception and
robust reasoning under ambiguity. Despite advances in anomaly detection,
existing methods often lack interpretability and struggle to capture the causal
and contextual aspects of abnormal events. This limitation is further
compounded by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating reasoning
ability in anomaly scenarios. To address both challenges, we introduce VAU-R1,
a data-efficient framework built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which enhances anomaly reasoning through Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT).
Besides, we propose VAU-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark tailored
for video anomaly reasoning, featuring multiple-choice QA, detailed rationales,
temporal annotations, and descriptive captions. Empirical results show that
VAU-R1 significantly improves question answering accuracy, temporal grounding,
and reasoning coherence across diverse contexts. Together, our method and
benchmark establish a strong foundation for interpretable and reasoning-aware
video anomaly understanding. Our code is available at

Method: 利用卫星传感器和实地观测数据，整合29,779个标注，涵盖感知、推理、科学知识推理和链式推理四个层级，通过专家和众包协作减少标注模糊性。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Earth science multimodal learning exhibit critical
limitations in systematic coverage of geosystem components and cross-sphere
interactions, often constrained to isolated subsystems (only in
Human-activities sphere or atmosphere) with limited evaluation dimensions (less
than 16 tasks). To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEarth-Bench, the first
comprehensive multimodal benchmark spanning all six Earth science spheres
(atmosphere, lithosphere, Oceansphere, cryosphere, biosphere and
Human-activities sphere) and cross-spheres with one hundred expert-curated
evaluation dimensions. Leveraging observational data from satellite sensors and
in-situ measurements, OmniEarth-Bench integrates 29,779 annotations across four
tiers: perception, general reasoning, scientific knowledge reasoning and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This involves the efforts of 2-5 experts per
sphere to establish authoritative evaluation dimensions and curate relevant
observational datasets, 40 crowd-sourcing annotators to assist experts for
annotations, and finally, OmniEarth-Bench is validated via hybrid expert-crowd
workflows to reduce label ambiguity. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs
reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where
none of them reach 35\% accuracy. Especially, in some cross-spheres tasks, the
performance of leading models like GPT-4o drops to 0.0\%. OmniEarth-Bench sets
a new standard for geosystem-aware AI, advancing both scientific discovery and
practical applications in environmental monitoring and disaster prediction. The
dataset, source code, and trained models were released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督或弱监督方法依赖标注数据，耗时耗力；无监督方法面临特征过度关注高判别性区域和缺乏上下文边界信息的挑战。

Method: 结合视觉语言预训练和分类预训练协作增强，引入音频感知丰富上下文边界信息，采用自监督跨视图学习范式。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上优于多个先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了无监督时序动作定位中的关键问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) has garnered significant attention in
information retrieval. Existing supervised or weakly supervised methods heavily
rely on labeled temporal boundaries and action categories, which are
labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, unsupervised temporal action
localization (UTAL) has gained popularity. However, current methods face two
main challenges: 1) Classification pre-trained features overly focus on highly
discriminative regions; 2) Solely relying on visual modality information makes
it difficult to determine contextual boundaries. To address these issues, we
propose a CLIP-assisted cross-view audiovisual enhanced UTAL method.
Specifically, we introduce visual language pre-training (VLP) and
classification pre-training-based collaborative enhancement to avoid excessive
focus on highly discriminative regions; we also incorporate audio perception to
provide richer contextual boundary information. Finally, we introduce a
self-supervised cross-view learning paradigm to achieve multi-view perceptual
enhancement without additional annotations. Extensive experiments on two public
datasets demonstrate our model's superiority over several state-of-the-art
competitors.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了肖像动画生成的挑战，并在多个指标上取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Generating highly dynamic and photorealistic portrait animations driven by
audio and skeletal motion remains challenging due to the need for precise lip
synchronization, natural facial expressions, and high-fidelity body motion
dynamics. We propose a human-preference-aligned diffusion framework that
addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce
direct preference optimization tailored for human-centric animation, leveraging
a curated dataset of human preferences to align generated outputs with
perceptual metrics for portrait motion-video alignment and naturalness of
expression. Second, the proposed temporal motion modulation resolves
spatiotemporal resolution mismatches by reshaping motion conditions into
dimensionally aligned latent features through temporal channel redistribution
and proportional feature expansion, preserving the fidelity of high-frequency
motion details in diffusion-based synthesis. The proposed mechanism is
complementary to existing UNet and DiT-based portrait diffusion approaches, and
experiments demonstrate obvious improvements in lip-audio synchronization,
expression vividness, body motion coherence over baseline methods, alongside
notable gains in human preference metrics. Our model and source code can be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产数字化的元数据不足限制了其可访问性和跨机构协作，需要结合先进技术解决这一问题。

Method: 提出MEM框架，结合计算机视觉模型、大语言模型和知识图谱，通过多层视觉机制（MVM）动态检测嵌套特征。

Result: 在Jagiellonian数字图书馆的数字化古籍数据集上验证了MEM的潜力，并发布了一个手动标注的数据集。

Conclusion: MEM为文化遗产研究提供了灵活可扩展的方法，展示了人工智能与语义技术在实践中的应用前景。

Abstract: The digitization of cultural heritage collections has opened new directions
for research, yet the lack of enriched metadata poses a substantial challenge
to accessibility, interoperability, and cross-institutional collaboration. In
several past years neural networks models such as YOLOv11 and Detectron2 have
revolutionized visual data analysis, but their application to domain-specific
cultural artifacts - such as manuscripts and incunabula - remains limited by
the absence of methodologies that address structural feature extraction and
semantic interoperability. In this position paper, we argue, that the
integration of neural networks with semantic technologies represents a paradigm
shift in cultural heritage digitization processes. We present the Metadata
Enrichment Model (MEM), a conceptual framework designed to enrich metadata for
digitized collections by combining fine-tuned computer vision models, large
language models (LLMs) and structured knowledge graphs. The Multilayer Vision
Mechanism (MVM) appears as the key innovation of MEM. This iterative process
improves visual analysis by dynamically detecting nested features, such as text
within seals or images within stamps. To expose MEM's potential, we apply it to
a dataset of digitized incunabula from the Jagiellonian Digital Library and
release a manually annotated dataset of 105 manuscript pages. We examine the
practical challenges of MEM's usage in real-world GLAM institutions, including
the need for domain-specific fine-tuning, the adjustment of enriched metadata
with Linked Data standards and computational costs. We present MEM as a
flexible and extensible methodology. This paper contributes to the discussion
on how artificial intelligence and semantic web technologies can advance
cultural heritage research, and also use these technologies in practice.

TLDR: Qwen-LA通过引入视觉-文本反射过程，减少视觉语言推理模型中的幻觉，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时间推理会稀释视觉信息，导致注意力不足和幻觉问题，现有文本反射方法不足以解决。

Method: 提出Qwen-LA模型，结合BRPO强化学习方法，动态决定何时进行视觉-文本反射，并通过Visual Token COPY和ROUTE强制模型重新关注视觉信息。

Result: 实验表明Qwen-LA在多个视觉问答数据集和幻觉指标上表现领先。

Conclusion: 视觉-文本反射和视觉信息补充能有效减少幻觉，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Inference time scaling drives extended reasoning to enhance the performance
of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), thus forming powerful Vision-Language
Reasoning Models (VLRMs). However, long reasoning dilutes visual tokens,
causing visual information to receive less attention and may trigger
hallucinations. Although introducing text-only reflection processes shows
promise in language models, we demonstrate that it is insufficient to suppress
hallucinations in VLMs. To address this issue, we introduce Qwen-LookAgain
(Qwen-LA), a novel VLRM designed to mitigate hallucinations by incorporating a
vision-text reflection process that guides the model to re-attention visual
information during reasoning. We first propose a reinforcement learning method
Balanced Reflective Policy Optimization (BRPO), which guides the model to
decide when to generate vision-text reflection on its own and balance the
number and length of reflections. Then, we formally prove that VLRMs lose
attention to visual tokens as reasoning progresses, and demonstrate that
supplementing visual information during reflection enhances visual attention.
Therefore, during training and inference, Visual Token COPY and Visual Token
ROUTE are introduced to force the model to re-attention visual information at
the visual level, addressing the limitations of text-only reflection.
Experiments on multiple visual QA datasets and hallucination metrics indicate
that Qwen-LA achieves leading accuracy performance while reducing
hallucinations. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）因视觉令牌序列较长导致计算成本高，难以实时部署，需优化令牌处理效率。

Method: 提出VScan框架，结合全局和局部扫描与令牌合并优化视觉编码，并在语言模型中间层引入剪枝。

Result: 在四个LVLMs上验证，VScan显著加速推理（LLaVA-NeXT-7B速度提升2.91倍，FLOPs减少10倍），性能保留95.4%。

Conclusion: VScan通过两阶段令牌减少有效平衡计算效率与性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multi-modal
understanding by incorporating finer-grained visual perception and encoding.
However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer
visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate
this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at
the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language
model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their
effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are
processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided
by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction
framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary
global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2)
introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive
experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in
accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current
state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a
10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4% of the original
performance.

Conclusion: Uni-MuMER通过统一框架和任务集成，显著提升了HMER性能，为领域知识注入通用模型提供了范例。

Abstract: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) remains a persistent
challenge in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) due to the inherent freedom of
symbol layout and variability in handwriting styles. Prior methods have faced
performance bottlenecks, proposing isolated architectural modifications that
are difficult to integrate coherently into a unified framework. Meanwhile,
recent advances in pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated
strong cross-task generalization, offering a promising foundation for
developing unified solutions. In this paper, we introduce Uni-MuMER, which
fully fine-tunes a VLM for the HMER task without modifying its architecture,
effectively injecting domain-specific knowledge into a generalist framework.
Our method integrates three data-driven tasks: Tree-Aware Chain-of-Thought
(Tree-CoT) for structured spatial reasoning, Error-Driven Learning (EDL) for
reducing confusion among visually similar characters, and Symbol Counting (SC)
for improving recognition consistency in long expressions. Experiments on the
CROHME and HME100K datasets show that Uni-MuMER achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, surpassing the best lightweight specialized model SSAN by 16.31%
and the top-performing VLM Gemini2.5-flash by 24.42% in the zero-shot setting.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在图像级分类准确率高，但缺乏可解释性和篡改区域定位能力，且真实场景中缺乏像素级标注。

Method: 基于WCBnet生成多视角特征图，融合预训练分割模型（如DeepLab、SegmentAnything和PSPnet）的分割信息，通过贝叶斯推理优化定位。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，可在无像素级标签的情况下定位图像篡改。

Conclusion: 弱监督方法解决了现有技术的局限性，为图像篡改检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The explosive growth of digital images and the widespread availability of
image editing tools have made image manipulation detection an increasingly
critical challenge. Current deep learning-based manipulation detection methods
excel in achieving high image-level classification accuracy, they often fall
short in terms of interpretability and localization of manipulated regions.
Additionally, the absence of pixel-wise annotations in real-world scenarios
limits the existing fully-supervised manipulation localization techniques. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach that
integrates activation maps generated by image-level manipulation detection
networks with segmentation maps from pre-trained models. Specifically, we build
on our previous image-level work named WCBnet to produce multi-view feature
maps which are subsequently fused for coarse localization. These coarse maps
are then refined using detailed segmented regional information provided by
pre-trained segmentation models (such as DeepLab, SegmentAnything and PSPnet),
with Bayesian inference employed to enhance the manipulation localization.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
highlighting the feasibility to localize image manipulations without relying on
pixel-level labels.

Abstract: The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations
from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks.
This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL using jigsaw
puzzles as a structured experimental framework, revealing several key findings.
\textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random
guessing on simple puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to
complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training
on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with
effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can
learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source
models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for
step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the
final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns
appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing
alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results
demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL
optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may

TLDR: DeepChest是一种动态任务加权框架，用于多标签胸部X光分类，通过性能驱动的权重机制提高效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）在医学影像领域具有优势，但任务贡献平衡是一个关键挑战。

Method: DeepChest利用任务特定损失趋势分析，动态调整任务权重，无需梯度访问，减少内存使用并提升训练速度。

Result: 在大型CXR数据集上，DeepChest整体准确率提升7%，并显著降低任务损失。

Conclusion: DeepChest为医学诊断中的深度学习提供了更高效和稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: While Multi-Task Learning (MTL) offers inherent advantages in complex domains
such as medical imaging by enabling shared representation learning, effectively
balancing task contributions remains a significant challenge. This paper
addresses this critical issue by introducing DeepChest, a novel,
computationally efficient and effective dynamic task-weighting framework
specifically designed for multi-label chest X-ray (CXR) classification. Unlike
existing heuristic or gradient-based methods that often incur substantial
overhead, DeepChest leverages a performance-driven weighting mechanism based on
effective analysis of task-specific loss trends. Given a network architecture
(e.g., ResNet18), our model-agnostic approach adaptively adjusts task
importance without requiring gradient access, thereby significantly reducing
memory usage and achieving a threefold increase in training speed. It can be
easily applied to improve various state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments on a large-scale CXR dataset demonstrate that DeepChest not only
outperforms state-of-the-art MTL methods by 7% in overall accuracy but also
yields substantial reductions in individual task losses, indicating improved
generalization and effective mitigation of negative transfer. The efficiency
and performance gains of DeepChest pave the way for more practical and robust
deployment of deep learning in critical medical diagnostic applications. The

*Georgios Voulgaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: PerceptiveNet结合对数Gabor卷积层和宽感受野主干网络，显著提升了树冠语义分割的精度，并在多领域数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 树冠精确分割对森林管理等科学任务至关重要，但传统方法和深度学习模型难以应对复杂森林冠层的挑战。

Method: 提出PerceptiveNet，采用可训练对数Gabor卷积层和宽感受野主干网络，结合CNN-Transformer混合模型。

Result: 在树冠数据集和多个基准数据集上超越现有方法，表现出色。

Conclusion: PerceptiveNet通过创新设计有效解决了复杂场景下的树冠分割问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The accurate semantic segmentation of tree crowns within remotely sensed data
is crucial for scientific endeavours such as forest management, biodiversity
studies, and carbon sequestration quantification. However, precise segmentation
remains challenging due to complexities in the forest canopy, including
shadows, intricate backgrounds, scale variations, and subtle spectral
differences among tree species. Compared to the traditional methods, Deep
Learning models improve accuracy by extracting informative and discriminative
features, but often fall short in capturing the aforementioned complexities.
  To address these challenges, we propose PerceptiveNet, a novel model
incorporating a Logarithmic Gabor-parameterised convolutional layer with
trainable filter parameters, alongside a backbone that extracts salient
features while capturing extensive context and spatial information through a
wider receptive field. We investigate the impact of Log-Gabor, Gabor, and
standard convolutional layers on semantic segmentation performance through
extensive experimentation. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to assess
the contributions of individual layers and their combinations to overall model
performance, and we evaluate PerceptiveNet as a backbone within a novel hybrid
CNN-Transformer model. Our results outperform state-of-the-art models,
demonstrating significant performance improvements on a tree crown dataset
while generalising across domains, including two benchmark aerial scene
semantic segmentation datasets with varying complexities.

TLDR: EndoBench是一个全面的基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在内窥镜实践中的表现，涵盖多种场景和任务，揭示了当前模型与专家临床推理之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试局限于特定内窥镜场景和少量临床任务，无法反映真实世界的多样性和临床工作流程的需求。

Method: 引入EndoBench，涵盖4种内窥镜场景、12项临床任务及其子任务、5种视觉提示粒度，包含6,832个验证过的VQA对。

Result: 实验表明专有MLLMs优于开源和医学专用模型，但仍不及人类专家；医学领域监督微调显著提升任务准确性；模型性能受提示格式和任务复杂度影响。

Conclusion: EndoBench为内窥镜领域的MLLMs评估和进步设定了新标准，并公开了基准测试和代码。

Abstract: Endoscopic procedures are essential for diagnosing and treating internal
diseases, and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly
applied to assist in endoscopy analysis. However, current benchmarks are
limited, as they typically cover specific endoscopic scenarios and a small set
of clinical tasks, failing to capture the real-world diversity of endoscopic
scenarios and the full range of skills needed in clinical workflows. To address
these issues, we introduce EndoBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to assess MLLMs across the full spectrum of endoscopic
practice with multi-dimensional capacities. EndoBench encompasses 4 distinct
endoscopic scenarios, 12 specialized clinical tasks with 12 secondary subtasks,
and 5 levels of visual prompting granularities, resulting in 6,832 rigorously
validated VQA pairs from 21 diverse datasets. Our multi-dimensional evaluation
framework mirrors the clinical workflow--spanning anatomical recognition,
lesion analysis, spatial localization, and surgical operations--to holistically
gauge the perceptual and diagnostic abilities of MLLMs in realistic scenarios.
We benchmark 23 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose,
medical-specialized, and proprietary MLLMs, and establish human clinician
performance as a reference standard. Our extensive experiments reveal: (1)
proprietary MLLMs outperform open-source and medical-specialized models
overall, but still trail human experts; (2) medical-domain supervised
fine-tuning substantially boosts task-specific accuracy; and (3) model
performance remains sensitive to prompt format and clinical task complexity.
EndoBench establishes a new standard for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in
endoscopy, highlighting both progress and persistent gaps between current
models and expert clinical reasoning. We publicly release our benchmark and
code.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于物体轨迹的视频标记化方法TrajViT，显著减少冗余并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频标记化方法因使用固定时空块导致计算效率低下且性能下降。

Method: 通过物体轨迹组织标记，结合对比学习训练TrajViT。

Result: TrajViT在多项任务中显著优于ViT3D，如视频-文本检索任务提升6% top-5召回率，且计算量大幅减少。

Conclusion: TrajViT是一种高效且可扩展的视频编码器，适用于多样化任务。

Abstract: Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for
long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches,
leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token
reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens
when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm
that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than
fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles,
ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video
duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories
and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing
redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive
learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across
multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a
large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with
10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for
being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2%
performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster
training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient
encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks,
making it a robust and scalable solution.

Result: 在ETH-80数据集上取得了良好的识别效果。

Conclusion: 方法有效但稳定性有待改进，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: We propose a new method for recognizing color image sets using quaternionic
Grassmannians, which use the power of quaternions to capture color information
and represent each color image set as a point on the quaternionic Grassmannian.
We provide a direct formula to calculate the shortest distance between two
points on the quaternionic Grassmannian, and use this distance to build a new
classification framework. Experiments on the ETH-80 benchmark dataset show that
our method achieves good recognition results. We also discuss some limitations
in stability and suggest ways the method can be improved in the future.

TLDR: 论文比较了两种基于持久同调的特征向量构建方法在医学图像分类中的效果，发现特征拼接方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征提取方法对输入的小变化敏感，而持久同调（PH）能稳定提取拓扑和几何特征，但如何从多个持久条码构建最终特征向量尚需研究。

Method: 比较两种方法：持久条码聚合后特征化与直接拼接拓扑特征向量，并在多种医学图像数据集上进行分类实验。

Result: 特征拼接方法保留了更多细节拓扑信息，分类性能更好。

Conclusion: 在类似实验中，特征拼接是更优的选择。

Abstract: In medical image analysis, feature engineering plays an important role in the
design and performance of machine learning models. Persistent homology (PH),
from the field of topological data analysis (TDA), demonstrates robustness and
stability to data perturbations and addresses the limitation from traditional
feature extraction approaches where a small change in input results in a large
change in feature representation. Using PH, we store persistent topological and
geometrical features in the form of the persistence barcode whereby large bars
represent global topological features and small bars encapsulate geometrical
information of the data. When multiple barcodes are computed from 2D or 3D
medical images, two approaches can be used to construct the final topological
feature vector in each dimension: aggregating persistence barcodes followed by
featurization or concatenating topological feature vectors derived from each
barcode. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
medical imaging datasets to compare the effects of the two aforementioned
approaches on the performance of classification models. The results of this
analysis indicate that feature concatenation preserves detailed topological
information from individual barcodes, yields better classification performance
and is therefore a preferred approach when conducting similar experiments.

Result: 在3D重建数据集上展示了具有竞争力的光度和几何结果。

Conclusion: 三角形作为表示单元在3D场景优化中具有优势，能够实现更好的表面连续性。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an inference-time optimization framework utilizing
triangles to represent the geometry and appearance of the scene. More
specifically, we develop a scene optimization algorithm for triangle soup, a
collection of disconnected semi-transparent triangle primitives. Compared to
the current most-widely used primitives for 3D scene representation, namely
Gaussian splats, triangles allow for more expressive color interpolation, and
benefit from a large algorithmic infrastructure for downstream tasks.
Triangles, unlike full-rank Gaussian kernels, naturally combine to form
surfaces. We formulate connectivity forces between triangles during
optimization, encouraging explicit, but soft, surface continuity in 3D. We
perform experiments on a representative 3D reconstruction dataset and show
competitive photometric and geometric results.

Motivation: 当前T2V模型在生成物理合理内容方面表现不佳，因其物理理解能力有限。

Method: 提出VideoREPA框架，利用Token Relation Distillation损失对齐视频理解基础模型与T2V模型的token级关系。

Result: VideoREPA显著提升了基线模型CogVideoX的物理常识，在相关基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: VideoREPA是首个针对T2V模型微调并注入物理知识的REPA方法，有效提升了生成视频的物理一致性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have enabled
high-fidelity and realistic video synthesis. However, current T2V models often
struggle to generate physically plausible content due to their limited inherent
ability to accurately understand physics. We found that while the
representations within T2V models possess some capacity for physics
understanding, they lag significantly behind those from recent video
self-supervised learning methods. To this end, we propose a novel framework
called VideoREPA, which distills physics understanding capability from video
understanding foundation models into T2V models by aligning token-level
relations. This closes the physics understanding gap and enable more
physics-plausible generation. Specifically, we introduce the Token Relation
Distillation (TRD) loss, leveraging spatio-temporal alignment to provide soft
guidance suitable for finetuning powerful pre-trained T2V models, a critical
departure from prior representation alignment (REPA) methods. To our knowledge,
VideoREPA is the first REPA method designed for finetuning T2V models and
specifically for injecting physical knowledge. Empirical evaluations show that
VideoREPA substantially enhances the physics commonsense of baseline method,
CogVideoX, achieving significant improvement on relevant benchmarks and
demonstrating a strong capacity for generating videos consistent with intuitive
physics. More video results are available at https://videorepa.github.io/.

Motivation: 传统的扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色，但其计算复杂度高。本文旨在通过自回归模型简化扩散过程，同时保留其优势。

Method: 设计了一种标记器将图像转换为离散标记序列，利用扩散的粗到细特性，直接应用标准的下一个标记预测任务生成图像。

Conclusion: D-AR展示了自回归模型在视觉合成中的潜力，为未来基于大型语言模型的统一架构研究提供了启发。

Abstract: This paper presents Diffusion via Autoregressive models (D-AR), a new
paradigm recasting the image diffusion process as a vanilla autoregressive
procedure in the standard next-token-prediction fashion. We start by designing
the tokenizer that converts images into sequences of discrete tokens, where
tokens in different positions can be decoded into different diffusion denoising
steps in the pixel space. Thanks to the diffusion properties, these tokens
naturally follow a coarse-to-fine order, which directly lends itself to
autoregressive modeling. Therefore, we apply standard next-token prediction on
these tokens, without modifying any underlying designs (either causal masks or
training/inference strategies), and such sequential autoregressive token
generation directly mirrors the diffusion procedure in image space. That is,
once the autoregressive model generates an increment of tokens, we can directly
decode these tokens into the corresponding diffusion denoising step in the
streaming manner. Our pipeline naturally reveals several intriguing properties,
for example, it supports consistent previews when generating only a subset of
tokens and enables zero-shot layout-controlled synthesis. On the standard
ImageNet benchmark, our method achieves 2.09 FID using a 775M Llama backbone
with 256 discrete tokens. We hope our work can inspire future research on
unified autoregressive architectures of visual synthesis, especially with large
language models. Code and models will be available at

TLDR: ViGoRL是一种视觉语言模型，通过强化学习将推理步骤与视觉坐标显式关联，提升视觉推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉推理任务需要模型具备视觉注意力、感知输入解释和空间证据支持的能力，传统方法缺乏显式关联机制。

Method: ViGoRL采用多轮强化学习框架，动态聚焦视觉坐标，生成空间关联的推理轨迹。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试中表现优异，如V*Bench达到86.4%，且人类评估显示其视觉参考准确且有助于理解。

Conclusion: 视觉强化学习是提升模型通用视觉推理能力的有效范式。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) over chains of thought has significantly
advanced language models in tasks such as mathematics and coding, visual
reasoning introduces added complexity by requiring models to direct visual
attention, interpret perceptual inputs, and ground abstract reasoning in
spatial evidence. We introduce ViGoRL (Visually Grounded Reinforcement
Learning), a vision-language model trained with RL to explicitly anchor each
reasoning step to specific visual coordinates. Inspired by human visual
decision-making, ViGoRL learns to produce spatially grounded reasoning traces,
guiding visual attention to task-relevant regions at each step. When
fine-grained exploration is required, our novel multi-turn RL framework enables
the model to dynamically zoom into predicted coordinates as reasoning unfolds.
Across a diverse set of visual reasoning benchmarks--including SAT-2 and BLINK
for spatial reasoning, V*bench for visual search, and ScreenSpot and
VisualWebArena for web-based grounding--ViGoRL consistently outperforms both
supervised fine-tuning and conventional RL baselines that lack explicit
grounding mechanisms. Incorporating multi-turn RL with zoomed-in visual
feedback significantly improves ViGoRL's performance on localizing small GUI
elements and visual search, achieving 86.4% on V*Bench. Additionally, we find
that grounding amplifies other visual behaviors such as region exploration,
grounded subgoal setting, and visual verification. Finally, human evaluations
show that the model's visual references are not only spatially accurate but
also helpful for understanding model reasoning steps. Our results show that
visually grounded RL is a strong paradigm for imbuing models with
general-purpose visual reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注自然视频，而忽略了AIGC视频的评估，同时MLLMs在AIGC视频上的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出VF-Eval基准，包含四个任务：连贯性验证、错误意识、错误类型检测和推理评估，评估了13个前沿MLLMs。

Result: 即使是表现最好的GPT-4.1模型在所有任务中表现也不稳定，表明基准的挑战性。

Conclusion: VF-Eval揭示了MLLMs在AIGC视频上的局限性，并通过RePrompt实验展示了人类反馈对改进视频生成的价值。

Abstract: MLLMs have been widely studied for video question answering recently.
However, most existing assessments focus on natural videos, overlooking
synthetic videos, such as AI-generated content (AIGC). Meanwhile, some works in
video generation rely on MLLMs to evaluate the quality of generated videos, but
the capabilities of MLLMs on interpreting AIGC videos remain largely
underexplored. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VF-Eval, which
introduces four tasks-coherence validation, error awareness, error type
detection, and reasoning evaluation-to comprehensively evaluate the abilities
of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VF-Eval and find that
even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good
performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our
benchmark. Additionally, to investigate the practical applications of VF-Eval
in improving video generation, we conduct an experiment, RePrompt,
demonstrating that aligning MLLMs more closely with human feedback can benefit
video generation.

Conclusion: 通过语义信息引导提示学习，DA-VPT能够更高效地微调ViT模型，并在多种下游视觉任务中取得更好的性能。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has become a promising solution for
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach for Vision Transformer (ViT)
models by partially fine-tuning learnable tokens while keeping most model
parameters frozen. Recent research has explored modifying the connection
structures of the prompts. However, the fundamental correlation and
distribution between the prompts and image tokens remain unexplored. In this
paper, we leverage metric learning techniques to investigate how the
distribution of prompts affects fine-tuning performance. Specifically, we
propose a novel framework, Distribution Aware Visual Prompt Tuning (DA-VPT), to
guide the distributions of the prompts by learning the distance metric from
their class-related semantic data. Our method demonstrates that the prompts can
serve as an effective bridge to share semantic information between image
patches and the class token. We extensively evaluated our approach on popular
benchmarks in both recognition and segmentation tasks. The results demonstrate
that our approach enables more effective and efficient fine-tuning of ViT
models by leveraging semantic information to guide the learning of the prompts,
leading to improved performance on various downstream vision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跟踪器在复杂场景中表现不佳，而视觉语言模型（VLMs）的语义理解能力为视觉目标跟踪（VOT）提供了新思路，但其直接应用存在文本表示不足、特征融合效率低和缺乏时间建模等问题。

Method: CLDTracker采用双分支架构（文本分支和视觉分支），利用CLIP和GPT-4V等模型生成丰富的文本描述，并通过高效的融合机制整合视觉和文本特征。

Result: 在六个标准VOT基准测试中，CLDTracker实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CLDTracker证明了利用鲁棒且时间自适应的视觉语言表示对提升跟踪任务的有效性。

Abstract: VOT remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision due to
dynamic appearance changes, occlusions, and background clutter. Traditional
trackers, relying primarily on visual cues, often struggle in such complex
scenarios. Recent advancements in VLMs have shown promise in semantic
understanding for tasks like open-vocabulary detection and image captioning,
suggesting their potential for VOT. However, the direct application of VLMs to
VOT is hindered by critical limitations: the absence of a rich and
comprehensive textual representation that semantically captures the target
object's nuances, limiting the effective use of language information;
inefficient fusion mechanisms that fail to optimally integrate visual and
textual features, preventing a holistic understanding of the target; and a lack
of temporal modeling of the target's evolving appearance in the language
domain, leading to a disconnect between the initial description and the
object's subsequent visual changes. To bridge these gaps and unlock the full
potential of VLMs for VOT, we propose CLDTracker, a novel Comprehensive
Language Description framework for robust visual Tracking. Our tracker
introduces a dual-branch architecture consisting of a textual and a visual
branch. In the textual branch, we construct a rich bag of textual descriptions
derived by harnessing the powerful VLMs such as CLIP and GPT-4V, enriched with
semantic and contextual cues to address the lack of rich textual
representation. Experiments on six standard VOT benchmarks demonstrate that
CLDTracker achieves SOTA performance, validating the effectiveness of
leveraging robust and temporally-adaptive vision-language representations for
tracking. Code and models are publicly available at:

Abstract: We introduce SLIMP (Skin Lesion Image-Metadata Pre-training) for learning
rich representations of skin lesions through a novel nested contrastive
learning approach that captures complex relationships between images and
metadata. Melanoma detection and skin lesion classification based solely on
images, pose significant challenges due to large variations in imaging
conditions (lighting, color, resolution, distance, etc.) and lack of clinical
and phenotypical context. Clinicians typically follow a holistic approach for
assessing the risk level of the patient and for deciding which lesions may be
malignant and need to be excised, by considering the patient's medical history
as well as the appearance of other lesions of the patient. Inspired by this,
SLIMP combines the appearance and the metadata of individual skin lesions with
patient-level metadata relating to their medical record and other clinically
relevant information. By fully exploiting all available data modalities
throughout the learning process, the proposed pre-training strategy improves
performance compared to other pre-training strategies on downstream skin
lesions classification tasks highlighting the learned representations quality.

TLDR: AnySplat是一种前馈网络，用于从未校准的图像集合中进行新视角合成，无需已知相机姿态或逐场景优化，且计算效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经渲染流程需要已知相机姿态和逐场景优化，而现有前馈方法在密集视角下计算负担重，AnySplat旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 模型通过单次前向传播预测3D高斯基元（编码几何和外观）及每张输入图像的相机内外参数，适用于无姿态标注的多视角数据集。

Result: 在零样本评估中，AnySplat在稀疏和密集视角下均达到与已知姿态基线相当的质量，并超越现有无姿态方法，同时显著降低渲染延迟。

Conclusion: AnySplat为无约束拍摄环境下的实时新视角合成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce AnySplat, a feed forward network for novel view synthesis from
uncalibrated image collections. In contrast to traditional neural rendering
pipelines that demand known camera poses and per scene optimization, or recent
feed forward methods that buckle under the computational weight of dense views,
our model predicts everything in one shot. A single forward pass yields a set
of 3D Gaussian primitives encoding both scene geometry and appearance, and the
corresponding camera intrinsics and extrinsics for each input image. This
unified design scales effortlessly to casually captured, multi view datasets
without any pose annotations. In extensive zero shot evaluations, AnySplat
matches the quality of pose aware baselines in both sparse and dense view
scenarios while surpassing existing pose free approaches. Moreover, it greatly
reduce rendering latency compared to optimization based neural fields, bringing
real time novel view synthesis within reach for unconstrained capture
settings.Project page: https://city-super.github.io/anysplat/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测任务中标注的主观性导致数据质量不一，噪声标注严重影响模型性能，尤其在少样本场景下。

Method: 结合多实例学习（MIL）框架和基于基础模型的预处理流程，校正噪声标注，并对检测头进行轻微修改。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现最先进性能，适用于标准和少样本场景，且方法更简单高效。

Conclusion: FMG-Det通过校正噪声标注和优化模型结构，显著提升了目标检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Collecting high quality data for object detection tasks is challenging due to
the inherent subjectivity in labeling the boundaries of an object. This makes
it difficult to not only collect consistent annotations across a dataset but
also to validate them, as no two annotators are likely to label the same object
using the exact same coordinates. These challenges are further compounded when
object boundaries are partially visible or blurred, which can be the case in
many domains. Training on noisy annotations significantly degrades detector
performance, rendering them unusable, particularly in few-shot settings, where
just a few corrupted annotations can impact model performance. In this work, we
propose FMG-Det, a simple, efficient methodology for training models with noisy
annotations. More specifically, we propose combining a multiple instance
learning (MIL) framework with a pre-processing pipeline that leverages powerful
foundation models to correct labels prior to training. This pre-processing
pipeline, along with slight modifications to the detector head, results in
state-of-the-art performance across a number of datasets, for both standard and
few-shot scenarios, while being much simpler and more efficient than other
approaches.

Method: 提出PixelThink，结合外部任务难度估计和内部模型不确定性，动态调节推理长度。

Result: 实验表明，PixelThink提高了推理效率和分割性能。

Conclusion: 为高效可解释的多模态理解提供了新视角。

Abstract: Existing reasoning segmentation approaches typically fine-tune multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) using image-text pairs and corresponding mask
labels. However, they exhibit limited generalization to out-of-distribution
scenarios without an explicit reasoning process. Although recent efforts
leverage reinforcement learning through group-relative policy optimization
(GRPO) to enhance reasoning ability, they often suffer from overthinking -
producing uniformly verbose reasoning chains irrespective of task complexity.
This results in elevated computational costs and limited control over reasoning
quality. To address this problem, we propose PixelThink, a simple yet effective
scheme that integrates externally estimated task difficulty and internally
measured model uncertainty to regulate reasoning generation within a
reinforcement learning paradigm. The model learns to compress reasoning length
in accordance with scene complexity and predictive confidence. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ReasonSeg-Diff, an extended benchmark
with annotated reasoning references and difficulty scores, along with a suite
of metrics designed to assess segmentation accuracy, reasoning quality, and
efficiency jointly. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach
improves both reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance. Our
work contributes novel perspectives towards efficient and interpretable
multimodal understanding. The code and model will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前馈3D高斯溅射模型因编码器容量有限，难以处理多视图输入，导致性能下降或内存消耗过大。

Method: 引入ZPressor模块，将多视图分为锚点和支持集，利用交叉注意力压缩信息，形成紧凑潜在状态Z。

Result: ZPressor使模型能在80GB GPU上处理100+视图，性能提升且鲁棒性增强。

Conclusion: ZPressor显著提升了前馈3DGS模型的扩展性和性能，适用于密集视图场景。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models have recently emerged as a
promising solution for novel view synthesis, enabling one-pass inference
without the need for per-scene 3DGS optimization. However, their scalability is
fundamentally constrained by the limited capacity of their encoders, leading to
degraded performance or excessive memory consumption as the number of input
views increases. In this work, we analyze feed-forward 3DGS frameworks through
the lens of the Information Bottleneck principle and introduce ZPressor, a
lightweight architecture-agnostic module that enables efficient compression of
multi-view inputs into a compact latent state $Z$ that retains essential scene
information while discarding redundancy. Concretely, ZPressor enables existing
feed-forward 3DGS models to scale to over 100 input views at 480P resolution on
an 80GB GPU, by partitioning the views into anchor and support sets and using
cross attention to compress the information from the support views into anchor
views, forming the compressed latent state $Z$. We show that integrating
ZPressor into several state-of-the-art feed-forward 3DGS models consistently
improves performance under moderate input views and enhances robustness under
dense view settings on two large-scale benchmarks DL3DV-10K and RealEstate10K.

Abstract: We present a keyframe-based framework for generating music-synchronized,
choreography aware animal dance videos. Starting from a few keyframes
representing distinct animal poses -- generated via text-to-image prompting or
GPT-4o -- we formulate dance synthesis as a graph optimization problem: find
the optimal keyframe structure that satisfies a specified choreography pattern
of beats, which can be automatically estimated from a reference dance video. We
also introduce an approach for mirrored pose image generation, essential for
capturing symmetry in dance. In-between frames are synthesized using an video
diffusion model. With as few as six input keyframes, our method can produce up
to 30 second dance videos across a wide range of animals and music tracks.

Conclusion: LayerPeeler通过创新方法解决了遮挡区域的矢量化问题，提升了矢量图形的质量和编辑灵活性。

Abstract: Image vectorization is a powerful technique that converts raster images into
vector graphics, enabling enhanced flexibility and interactivity. However,
popular image vectorization tools struggle with occluded regions, producing
incomplete or fragmented shapes that hinder editability. While recent
advancements have explored rule-based and data-driven layer-wise image
vectorization, these methods face limitations in vectorization quality and
flexibility. In this paper, we introduce LayerPeeler, a novel layer-wise image
vectorization approach that addresses these challenges through a progressive
simplification paradigm. The key to LayerPeeler's success lies in its
autoregressive peeling strategy: by identifying and removing the topmost
non-occluded layers while recovering underlying content, we generate vector
graphics with complete paths and coherent layer structures. Our method
leverages vision-language models to construct a layer graph that captures
occlusion relationships among elements, enabling precise detection and
description for non-occluded layers. These descriptive captions are used as
editing instructions for a finetuned image diffusion model to remove the
identified layers. To ensure accurate removal, we employ localized attention
control that precisely guides the model to target regions while faithfully
preserving the surrounding content. To support this, we contribute a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for layer peeling tasks. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LayerPeeler
significantly outperforms existing techniques, producing vectorization results
with superior path semantics, geometric regularity, and visual fidelity.

Abstract: Video generation has made substantial strides with the emergence of deep
generative models, especially diffusion-based approaches. However, video
generation based on multiple reference subjects still faces significant
challenges in maintaining multi-subject consistency and ensuring high
generation quality. In this paper, we propose MAGREF, a unified framework for
any-reference video generation that introduces masked guidance to enable
coherent multi-subject video synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images
and a textual prompt. Specifically, we propose (1) a region-aware dynamic
masking mechanism that enables a single model to flexibly handle various
subject inference, including humans, objects, and backgrounds, without
architectural changes, and (2) a pixel-wise channel concatenation mechanism
that operates on the channel dimension to better preserve appearance features.
Our model delivers state-of-the-art video generation quality, generalizing from
single-subject training to complex multi-subject scenarios with coherent
synthesis and precise control over individual subjects, outperforming existing
open-source and commercial baselines. To facilitate evaluation, we also
introduce a comprehensive multi-subject video benchmark. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, paving the way for scalable,
controllable, and high-fidelity multi-subject video synthesis. Code and model

Conclusion: 该方法通过重新利用预训练扩散模型，显著提升了低光图像的质量。

Abstract: High-quality photography in extreme low-light conditions is challenging but
impactful for digital cameras. With advanced computing hardware, traditional
camera image signal processor (ISP) algorithms are gradually being replaced by
efficient deep networks that enhance noisy raw images more intelligently.
However, existing regression-based models often minimize pixel errors and
result in oversmoothing of low-light photos or deep shadows. Recent work has
attempted to address this limitation by training a diffusion model from
scratch, yet those models still struggle to recover sharp image details and
accurate colors. We introduce a novel framework to enhance low-light raw images
by retasking pre-trained generative diffusion models with the camera ISP.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art in perceptual quality across three challenging low-light raw
image benchmarks.

Conclusion: SOYO为参数隔离域增量学习提供了一种高效解决方案，适用于多种任务，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often underperform in real-world, dynamic
settings where data distributions change over time. Domain Incremental Learning
(DIL) offers a solution by enabling continual model adaptation, with
Parameter-Isolation DIL (PIDIL) emerging as a promising paradigm to reduce
knowledge conflicts. However, existing PIDIL methods struggle with parameter
selection accuracy, especially as the number of domains and corresponding
classes grows. To address this, we propose SOYO, a lightweight framework that
improves domain selection in PIDIL. SOYO introduces a Gaussian Mixture
Compressor (GMC) and Domain Feature Resampler (DFR) to store and balance prior
domain data efficiently, while a Multi-level Domain Feature Fusion Network
(MDFN) enhances domain feature extraction. Our framework supports multiple
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods and is validated across tasks
such as image classification, object detection, and speech enhancement.
Experimental results on six benchmarks demonstrate SOYO's consistent
superiority over existing baselines, showcasing its robustness and adaptability
in complex, evolving environments. The codes will be released in

Motivation: VLM在零样本和迁移学习中表现优异，但存在误分类风险，尤其在安全关键领域可能导致严重后果。

Method: 提出一种基于图像嵌入空间的置信度评分函数，利用模态间隙和概念在嵌入空间中的区分度。

Result: 在17个数据集、4种架构和2种VLM上验证，性能提升显著（AURC提升51.87%，AUROC提升9.14%，FPR95提升32.42%）。

Conclusion: TrustVLM无需重新训练即可提升VLM可靠性，为实际应用中的安全部署铺平道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
aligning visual and textual modalities, enabling a wide range of applications
in multimodal understanding and generation. While they excel in zero-shot and
transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification,
often yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a
significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can
lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a
training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of
estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed
modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly
represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring
function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We
rigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4
architectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95
compared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model
without requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of
VLMs in real-world applications. The code will be available at

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，Spatial-MLLM在视觉空间理解和推理任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Spatial-MLLM为纯2D输入场景提供了高效的空间推理解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their
spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on
additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their
utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this
paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial
reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which
rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our
key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward
visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder
architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and
a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to
extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into
unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we
propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects
the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under
limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial
reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k
dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO.
Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our
spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of
visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. Project page:

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is essential for multimodal large language models

probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image
spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench,
a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision
researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging,
unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired
with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We
conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model
attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while
humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench
and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated
reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that
diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2)
overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled tool-augmented
agents capable of solving complex real-world tasks through step-by-step
reasoning. However, existing evaluations often focus on general-purpose or
multimodal scenarios, leaving a gap in domain-specific benchmarks that assess
tool-use capabilities in complex remote sensing use cases. We present ThinkGeo,
an agentic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-driven agents on remote sensing
tasks via structured tool use and multi-step planning. Inspired by
tool-interaction paradigms, ThinkGeo includes human-curated queries spanning a
wide range of real-world applications such as urban planning, disaster
assessment and change analysis, environmental monitoring, transportation
analysis, aviation monitoring, recreational infrastructure, and industrial site
analysis. Each query is grounded in satellite or aerial imagery and requires
agents to reason through a diverse toolset. We implement a ReAct-style
interaction loop and evaluate both open and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o,
Qwen2.5) on 436 structured agentic tasks. The benchmark reports both step-wise
execution metrics and final answer correctness. Our analysis reveals notable
disparities in tool accuracy and planning consistency across models. ThinkGeo
provides the first extensive testbed for evaluating how tool-enabled LLMs
handle spatial reasoning in remote sensing. Our code and dataset are publicly

Motivation: 现有3D目标检测方法依赖全局信息和已知相机姿态，而RfM旨在解决无姿态图像集合的3D目标检测问题。

Method: RfM用基于3D框的物体中心匹配器替代传统2D关键点匹配器，估计相机姿态和物体轨迹，生成全局语义3D物体地图。

Result: RfM在CA-1M和ScanNet++上表现出优于点云或多视图方法的地图质量，定位性能强。

Conclusion: RfM提供了一种通用的物体中心表示，适用于稀疏定位和参数化建图，扩展了Cubify Anything的应用场景。

Abstract: We revisit scene-level 3D object detection as the output of an object-centric
framework capable of both localization and mapping using 3D oriented boxes as
the underlying geometric primitive. While existing 3D object detection
approaches operate globally and implicitly rely on the a priori existence of
metric camera poses, our method, Rooms from Motion (RfM) operates on a
collection of un-posed images. By replacing the standard 2D keypoint-based
matcher of structure-from-motion with an object-centric matcher based on
image-derived 3D boxes, we estimate metric camera poses, object tracks, and
finally produce a global, semantic 3D object map. When a priori pose is
available, we can significantly improve map quality through optimization of
global 3D boxes against individual observations. RfM shows strong localization
performance and subsequently produces maps of higher quality than leading
point-based and multi-view 3D object detection methods on CA-1M and ScanNet++,
despite these global methods relying on overparameterization through point
clouds or dense volumes. Rooms from Motion achieves a general, object-centric
representation which not only extends the work of Cubify Anything to full
scenes but also allows for inherently sparse localization and parametric
mapping proportional to the number of objects in a scene.

Conclusion: Impromptu VLA数据集有效提升了VLA模型的性能，特别是在非结构化场景下的表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving show promise but
falter in unstructured corner case scenarios, largely due to a scarcity of
targeted benchmarks. To address this, we introduce Impromptu VLA. Our core
contribution is the Impromptu VLA Dataset: over 80,000 meticulously curated
video clips, distilled from over 2M source clips sourced from 8 open-source
large-scale datasets. This dataset is built upon our novel taxonomy of four
challenging unstructured categories and features rich, planning-oriented
question-answering annotations and action trajectories. Crucially, experiments
demonstrate that VLAs trained with our dataset achieve substantial performance
gains on established benchmarks--improving closed-loop NeuroNCAP scores and
collision rates, and reaching near state-of-the-art L2 accuracy in open-loop
nuScenes trajectory prediction. Furthermore, our Q&A suite serves as an
effective diagnostic, revealing clear VLM improvements in perception,
prediction, and planning. Our code, data and models are available at

*Yusuf Dalva,Hidir Yesiltepe,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: LoRAShop是一个基于LoRA模型的多概念图像编辑框架，通过分析扩散变换器中的特征交互模式，实现多概念的无缝编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多概念图像编辑中身份保留和全局上下文一致性的问题，提升编辑的实用性和效率。

Method: 利用扩散变换器的特征激活模式，生成分离的潜在掩码，并在特定区域混合LoRA权重。

Result: 实验表明，LoRAShop在身份保留方面优于基线方法，且无需重新训练或外部约束。

Conclusion: LoRAShop为个性化扩散模型提供了实用的编辑工具，推动了视觉创作和快速迭代的新方向。

Abstract: We introduce LoRAShop, the first framework for multi-concept image editing
with LoRA models. LoRAShop builds on a key observation about the feature
interaction patterns inside Flux-style diffusion transformers: concept-specific
transformer features activate spatially coherent regions early in the denoising
process. We harness this observation to derive a disentangled latent mask for
each concept in a prior forward pass and blend the corresponding LoRA weights
only within regions bounding the concepts to be personalized. The resulting
edits seamlessly integrate multiple subjects or styles into the original scene
while preserving global context, lighting, and fine details. Our experiments
demonstrate that LoRAShop delivers better identity preservation compared to
baselines. By eliminating retraining and external constraints, LoRAShop turns
personalized diffusion models into a practical `photoshop-with-LoRAs' tool and
opens new avenues for compositional visual storytelling and rapid creative
iteration.

TLDR: 论文提出两种针对草图数据的组件，通过知识蒸馏和动态画布选择器，显著降低计算量（FLOPs减少99.37%），同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高效轻量模型适用于照片但不适用于草图数据，缺乏针对草图的专门研究。

Method: 提出跨模态知识蒸馏网络和基于强化学习的动态画布选择器，适配草图数据。

Result: FLOPs减少99.37%（从40.18G降至0.254G），准确性接近（33.03% vs 32.77%）。

Conclusion: 实现了针对稀疏草图数据的高效网络，计算量甚至低于最佳照片模型。

Abstract: As sketch research has collectively matured over time, its adaptation for
at-mass commercialisation emerges on the immediate horizon. Despite an already
mature research endeavour for photos, there is no research on the efficient
inference specifically designed for sketch data. In this paper, we first
demonstrate existing state-of-the-art efficient light-weight models designed
for photos do not work on sketches. We then propose two sketch-specific
components which work in a plug-n-play manner on any photo efficient network to
adapt them to work on sketch data. We specifically chose fine-grained
sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) as a demonstrator as the most recognised
sketch problem with immediate commercial value. Technically speaking, we first
propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation network to transfer existing photo
efficient networks to be compatible with sketch, which brings down number of
FLOPs and model parameters by 97.96% percent and 84.89% respectively. We then
exploit the abstract trait of sketch to introduce a RL-based canvas selector
that dynamically adjusts to the abstraction level which further cuts down
number of FLOPs by two thirds. The end result is an overall reduction of 99.37%
of FLOPs (from 40.18G to 0.254G) when compared with a full network, while
retaining the accuracy (33.03% vs 32.77%) -- finally making an efficient
network for the sparse sketch data that exhibit even fewer FLOPs than the best
photo counterpart.

Conclusion: 显式语言引导的视觉兴趣区域参与对MLLMs至关重要，需从视觉中心视角推进多模态智能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in vision-language tasks, yet they often struggle with
vision-centric scenarios where precise visual focus is needed for accurate
reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Argus to address these limitations with
a new visual attention grounding mechanism. Our approach employs object-centric
grounding as visual chain-of-thought signals, enabling more effective
goal-conditioned visual attention during multimodal reasoning tasks.
Evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Argus excels in both
multimodal reasoning tasks and referring object grounding tasks. Extensive
analysis further validates various design choices of Argus, and reveals the
effectiveness of explicit language-guided visual region-of-interest engagement
in MLLMs, highlighting the importance of advancing multimodal intelligence from

Result: 在开放词汇语义分割、指代表达理解等任务中表现优异，优于或媲美现有无训练方法。

Conclusion: TextRegion框架简单高效，兼容多种图像文本模型，易于扩展，具有广泛实用性。

Abstract: Image-text models excel at image-level tasks but struggle with detailed
visual understanding. While these models provide strong visual-language
alignment, segmentation models like SAM2 offer precise spatial boundaries for
objects. To this end, we propose TextRegion, a simple, effective, and
training-free framework that combines the strengths of image-text models and
SAM2 to generate powerful text-aligned region tokens. These tokens enable
detailed visual understanding while preserving open-vocabulary capabilities.
They can be directly applied to various downstream tasks, including open-world
semantic segmentation, referring expression comprehension, and grounding. We
conduct extensive evaluations and consistently achieve superior or competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods. Additionally,
our framework is compatible with many image-text models, making it highly
practical and easily extensible as stronger models emerge. Code is available

Motivation: 开发低成本、开源且可定制的鼻音测量系统，以替代昂贵的商业设备。

Method: 设计并3D打印硬件系统，与商业设备进行性能对比，并测试不同麦克风和材料的适应性。

Result: Nosey的鼻音评分高于商业设备，但两者在音系环境对比上表现一致。

Conclusion: Nosey是商业设备的灵活且经济的替代品，适合数据收集。

Abstract: We introduce Nosey (Nasalance Open Source Estimation sYstem), a low-cost,
customizable, 3D-printed system for recording acoustic nasalance data that we
have made available as open-source hardware
(http://github.com/phoneticslab/nosey). We first outline the motivations and
design principles behind our hardware nasalance system, and then present a
comparison between Nosey and a commercial nasalance device. Nosey shows
consistently higher nasalance scores than the commercial device, but the
magnitude of contrast between phonological environments is comparable between
systems. We also review ways of customizing the hardware to facilitate testing,
such as comparison of microphones and different construction materials. We
conclude that Nosey is a flexible and cost-effective alternative to commercial
nasometry devices and propose some methodological considerations for its use in

TLDR: 论文提出Wav2Sem模块，通过语义解耦解决语音驱动面部动画中音近字异导致的唇形平均化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用自监督音频模型编码，但音近字异导致特征耦合，影响唇形生成效果。

Method: 提出Wav2Sem模块，提取音频序列的语义特征，解耦音频编码以增强表达能力。

Result: 实验表明Wav2Sem有效解耦音频特征，提升唇形生成的精确性和自然度。

Conclusion: Wav2Sem模块显著改善了语音驱动面部动画的质量。

Abstract: In 3D speech-driven facial animation generation, existing methods commonly
employ pre-trained self-supervised audio models as encoders. However, due to
the prevalence of phonetically similar syllables with distinct lip shapes in
language, these near-homophone syllables tend to exhibit significant coupling
in self-supervised audio feature spaces, leading to the averaging effect in
subsequent lip motion generation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
plug-and-play semantic decorrelation module-Wav2Sem. This module extracts
semantic features corresponding to the entire audio sequence, leveraging the
added semantic information to decorrelate audio encodings within the feature
space, thereby achieving more expressive audio features. Extensive experiments
across multiple Speech-driven models indicate that the Wav2Sem module
effectively decouples audio features, significantly alleviating the averaging
effect of phonetically similar syllables in lip shape generation, thereby
enhancing the precision and naturalness of facial animations. Our source code
is available at https://github.com/wslh852/Wav2Sem.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频信号作为自然直观的交互方式，其语义编码潜力未被充分挖掘。现有方法多关注音频节奏与动作匹配，忽略了语义关联。

Method: 采用掩码生成变换器和记忆检索注意力模块处理稀疏长音频输入，并通过丰富数据集（将描述转换为对话风格并生成多样化音频）提升模型性能。

Result: 实验证明该框架高效有效，音频指令能传达与文本相似的语义，同时提供更实用和用户友好的交互体验。

Conclusion: 音频信号可作为语义编码的有效媒介，为交互技术提供新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive technologies have highlighted the prominence
of audio signals for semantic encoding. This paper explores a new task, where
audio signals are used as conditioning inputs to generate motions that align
with the semantics of the audio. Unlike text-based interactions, audio provides
a more natural and intuitive communication method. However, existing methods
typically focus on matching motions with music or speech rhythms, which often
results in a weak connection between the semantics of the audio and generated
motions. We propose an end-to-end framework using a masked generative
transformer, enhanced by a memory-retrieval attention module to handle sparse
and lengthy audio inputs. Additionally, we enrich existing datasets by
converting descriptions into conversational style and generating corresponding
audio with varied speaker identities. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and efficiency of the proposed framework, demonstrating that audio instructions
can convey semantics similar to text while providing more practical and
user-friendly interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前监督深度学习方法需要大量标注数据且难以泛化到真实世界复杂声学场景，因此探索预训练生成模型是否可克服这些限制。

Method: 通过将混合音频反转到扩散模型的潜在空间，利用文本条件引导去噪过程恢复单个源信号。

Result: ZeroSep在多个分离基准测试中表现优异，甚至超过监督方法。

Conclusion: 预训练文本引导扩散模型可用于零样本音频源分离，具有开放集支持和高性能。

Abstract: Audio source separation is fundamental for machines to understand complex
acoustic environments and underpins numerous audio applications. Current
supervised deep learning approaches, while powerful, are limited by the need
for extensive, task-specific labeled data and struggle to generalize to the
immense variability and open-set nature of real-world acoustic scenes. Inspired
by the success of generative foundation models, we investigate whether
pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion models can overcome these limitations.
We make a surprising discovery: zero-shot source separation can be achieved
purely through a pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion model under the right
configuration. Our method, named ZeroSep, works by inverting the mixed audio
into the diffusion model's latent space and then using text conditioning to
guide the denoising process to recover individual sources. Without any
task-specific training or fine-tuning, ZeroSep repurposes the generative
diffusion model for a discriminative separation task and inherently supports
open-set scenarios through its rich textual priors. ZeroSep is compatible with
a variety of pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion backbones and delivers
strong separation performance on multiple separation benchmarks, surpassing
even supervised methods.

Method: 重新设计数据结构和引入可定制贪婪解码，支持多种ASR模型类型，计算开销低于7%。

Result: 在域外场景中，NGPU-LM减少了贪婪解码与束搜索之间50%以上的准确率差距，同时避免了束搜索的显著减速。

Conclusion: NGPU-LM为ASR任务提供了一种高效、并行的解决方案，其实现已开源。

Abstract: Statistical n-gram language models are widely used for context-biasing tasks
in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, existing implementations lack
computational efficiency due to poor parallelization, making context-biasing
less appealing for industrial use. This work rethinks data structures for
statistical n-gram language models to enable fast and parallel operations for
GPU-optimized inference. Our approach, named NGPU-LM, introduces customizable
greedy decoding for all major ASR model types - including transducers,
attention encoder-decoder models, and CTC - with less than 7% computational
overhead. The proposed approach can eliminate more than 50% of the accuracy gap
between greedy and beam search for out-of-domain scenarios while avoiding
significant slowdown caused by beam search. The implementation of the proposed
NGPU-LM is open-sourced.

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人非结构化环境导航提供了一种有效的异常检测解决方案。

Abstract: In order to navigate safely and reliably in off-road and unstructured
environments, robots must detect anomalies that are out-of-distribution (OOD)
with respect to the training data. We present an analysis-by-synthesis approach
for pixel-wise anomaly detection without making any assumptions about the
nature of OOD data. Given an input image, we use a generative diffusion model
to synthesize an edited image that removes anomalies while keeping the
remaining image unchanged. Then, we formulate anomaly detection as analyzing
which image segments were modified by the diffusion model. We propose a novel
inference approach for guided diffusion by analyzing the ideal guidance
gradient and deriving a principled approximation that bootstraps the diffusion
model to predict guidance gradients. Our editing technique is purely test-time
that can be integrated into existing workflows without the need for retraining
or fine-tuning. Finally, we use a combination of vision-language foundation
models to compare pixels in a learned feature space and detect semantically
meaningful edits, enabling accurate anomaly detection for off-road navigation.

Result: 在合成和真实环境中表现出SOTA性能，零样本下显著优于现有方法，并在10 FPS下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TrackVLA展示了视觉-语言-动作模型在复杂动态环境中的强大潜力。

Abstract: Embodied visual tracking is a fundamental skill in Embodied AI, enabling an
agent to follow a specific target in dynamic environments using only egocentric
vision. This task is inherently challenging as it requires both accurate target
recognition and effective trajectory planning under conditions of severe
occlusion and high scene dynamics. Existing approaches typically address this
challenge through a modular separation of recognition and planning. In this
work, we propose TrackVLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that learns the
synergy between object recognition and trajectory planning. Leveraging a shared
LLM backbone, we employ a language modeling head for recognition and an
anchor-based diffusion model for trajectory planning. To train TrackVLA, we
construct an Embodied Visual Tracking Benchmark (EVT-Bench) and collect diverse
difficulty levels of recognition samples, resulting in a dataset of 1.7 million
samples. Through extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world
environments, TrackVLA demonstrates SOTA performance and strong
generalizability. It significantly outperforms existing methods on public
benchmarks in a zero-shot manner while remaining robust to high dynamics and
occlusion in real-world scenarios at 10 FPS inference speed. Our project page

Abstract: Controllable trajectory generation guided by high-level semantic decisions,
termed meta-actions, is crucial for autonomous driving systems. A significant
limitation of existing frameworks is their reliance on invariant meta-actions
assigned over fixed future time intervals, causing temporal misalignment with
the actual behavior trajectories. This misalignment leads to irrelevant
associations between the prescribed meta-actions and the resulting
trajectories, disrupting task coherence and limiting model performance. To
address this challenge, we introduce Autoregressive Meta-Actions, an approach
integrated into autoregressive trajectory generation frameworks that provides a
unified and precise definition for meta-action-conditioned trajectory
prediction. Specifically, We decompose traditional long-interval meta-actions
into frame-level meta-actions, enabling a sequential interplay between
autoregressive meta-action prediction and meta-action-conditioned trajectory
generation. This decomposition ensures strict alignment between each trajectory
segment and its corresponding meta-action, achieving a consistent and unified
task formulation across the entire trajectory span and significantly reducing
complexity. Moreover, we propose a staged pre-training process to decouple the
learning of basic motion dynamics from the integration of high-level decision
control, which offers flexibility, stability, and modularity. Experimental
results validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating improved
trajectory adaptivity and responsiveness to dynamic decision-making scenarios.

Conclusion: 策略移动化通过优化基座姿态，无需额外训练即可提升策略泛化能力，为移动操纵任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex
manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data
collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to
poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these
policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing
buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization
problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in
distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of
camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust
to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples
navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional
demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing
efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and
remains compatible with them. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the
Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty
of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation
tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization
tools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel
approach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's
base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our
approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score
function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to
identify optimal robot poses. We show that our approach outperforms baselines
in both simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating its effectiveness
for policy mobilization.

Motivation: 现有基准测试（如SWE-bench）因未更新、覆盖范围窄和依赖人工而限制了其扩展性和实用性，亟需一种动态更新的解决方案。

Method: 提出SWE-bench-Live，包含1,319个来自2024年后的GitHub问题的任务，覆盖93个仓库，并采用自动化流程（\method）进行任务生成和环境设置。

Result: 实验显示，现有LLMs和代理框架在SWE-bench-Live上的表现显著低于静态基准，揭示了动态任务的挑战性。

Conclusion: SWE-bench-Live为动态、真实的软件开发环境提供了更严谨、抗污染的评估工具，有助于推动LLMs和代理的研究。

Abstract: The issue-resolving task, where a model generates patches to fix real-world
bugs, has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs). While SWE-bench and its variants have become
standard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been
updated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and
depend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment
setup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and
data contamination. In this work, we present \textbf{SWE-bench-Live}, a
\textit{live-updatable} benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our
initial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created
since 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated
Docker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is
\method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process
from instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and
enabling scalability and continuous updates. We evaluate a range of
state-of-the-art agent frameworks and LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a
substantial performance gap compared to static benchmarks like SWE-bench, even
under controlled evaluation conditions. To better understand this discrepancy,
we perform detailed analyses across repository origin, issue recency, and task
difficulty. By providing a fresh, diverse, and executable benchmark grounded in
live repository activity, SWE-bench-Live facilitates rigorous,
contamination-resistant evaluation of LLMs and agents in dynamic, real-world
software development settings.

Abstract: Software is an essential component of research. However, little attention has
been paid to it compared with that paid to research data. Recently, there has
been an increase in efforts to acknowledge and highlight the importance of
software in research activities.
  Structured metadata from platforms like bio.tools, Bioconductor, and Galaxy
ToolShed offers valuable insights into research software in the Life Sciences.
Although originally intended to support discovery and integration, this
metadata can be repurposed for large-scale analysis of software practices.
However, its quality and completeness vary across platforms, reflecting diverse
documentation practices.
  To gain a comprehensive view of software development and sustainability,
consolidating this metadata is necessary, but requires robust mechanisms to
address its heterogeneity and scale.
  This article presents an evaluation of instruction-tuned large language
models for the task of software metadata identity resolution, a critical step
in assembling a cohesive collection of research software. Such a collection is
the reference component for the Software Observatory at OpenEBench, a platform
that aggregates metadata to monitor the FAIRness of research software in the
Life Sciences.
  We benchmarked multiple models against a human-annotated gold standard,
examined their behavior on ambiguous cases, and introduced an agreement-based
proxy for high-confidence automated decisions. The proxy achieved high
precision and statistical robustness, while also highlighting the limitations
of current models and the broader challenges of automating semantic judgment in
FAIR-aligned software metadata across registries and repositories.

Abstract: Developing high-performance software is a complex task that requires
specialized expertise. We introduce GSO, a benchmark for evaluating language
models' capabilities in developing high-performance software. We develop an
automated pipeline that generates and executes performance tests to analyze
repository commit histories to identify 102 challenging optimization tasks
across 10 codebases, spanning diverse domains and programming languages. An
agent is provided with a codebase and performance test as a precise
specification, and tasked to improve the runtime efficiency, which is measured
against the expert developer optimization. Our quantitative evaluation reveals
that leading SWE-Agents struggle significantly, achieving less than 5% success
rate, with limited improvements even with inference-time scaling. Our
qualitative analysis identifies key failure modes, including difficulties with
low-level languages, practicing lazy optimization strategies, and challenges in
accurately localizing bottlenecks. We release the code and artifacts of our
benchmark along with agent trajectories to enable future research.

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to compress large language models (LLMs)
by removing unimportant weights, but it often suffers from significant
performance degradation - especially under semi-structured sparsity
constraints. Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the
importance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve
critical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective:
rather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute
parameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By
minimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our
approach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby
enhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator,
which applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight
matrices. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with
existing pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated
on LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4
semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and
zero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4
semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the
dense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points. Codes are
available at https://github.com/Axel-gu/DenoiseRotator.

Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法（如LoRA）在方向调整上缺乏几何基础，限制了其灵活性和可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，MAP与现有方法结合时性能显著提升，且设计简单通用。

Conclusion: MAP有望成为未来参数高效微调方法的默认设计框架。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has revolutionized natural
language processing, but their fine-tuning remains computationally expensive,
hindering broad deployment. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods,
such as LoRA, have emerged as solutions. Recent work like DoRA attempts to
further decompose weight adaptation into direction and magnitude components.
However, existing formulations often define direction heuristically at the
column level, lacking a principled geometric foundation. In this paper, we
propose MAP, a novel framework that reformulates weight matrices as
high-dimensional vectors and decouples their adaptation into direction and
magnitude in a rigorous manner. MAP normalizes the pre-trained weights, learns
a directional update, and introduces two scalar coefficients to independently
scale the magnitude of the base and update vectors. This design enables more
interpretable and flexible adaptation, and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments show that MAP significantly
improves performance when coupling with existing methods, offering a simple yet
powerful enhancement to existing PEFT methods. Given the universality and
simplicity of MAP, we hope it can serve as a default setting for designing
future PEFT methods.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their
capabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require
extensive training on massive datasets. However, such datasets often contain
sensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising
concerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to
request the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the
development of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific
knowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these
advancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a
challenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this
work, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning
evaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and
five prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we
evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies.
To explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel
technique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the
limitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.

Result: 实验表明，SPR优于其他正则化方法，显著提升KGC模型性能。

Conclusion: 精心设计的正则化不仅能缓解过拟合，还能突破模型性能上限，SPR方法为此提供了有效实现。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) has attracted considerable attention in
recent years because it is critical to improving the quality of knowledge
graphs. Researchers have continuously explored various models. However, most
previous efforts have neglected to take advantage of regularization from a
deeper perspective and therefore have not been used to their full potential.
This paper rethinks the application of regularization methods in KGC. Through
extensive empirical studies on various KGC models, we find that carefully
designed regularization not only alleviates overfitting and reduces variance
but also enables these models to break through the upper bounds of their
original performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sparse-regularization
method that embeds the concept of rank-based selective sparsity into the KGC
regularizer. The core idea is to selectively penalize those components with
significant features in the embedding vector, thus effectively ignoring many
components that contribute little and may only represent noise. Various
comparative experiments on multiple datasets and multiple models show that the
SPR regularization method is better than other regularization methods and can
enable the KGC model to further break through the performance margin.

Motivation: 当前TN-SS算法计算成本高且缺乏领域信息和结构透明度，需要一种更高效且透明的方法。

Method: 提出tnLLM框架，利用LLM的推理能力通过领域感知提示管道预测TN结构，并生成领域感知解释。

Result: 实验显示tnLLM在较少函数评估下达到与SOTA算法相当的TN-SS目标函数值，并能加速其他方法的收敛。

Conclusion: tnLLM通过结合LLM和领域信息，提供了一种高效、透明且可解释的TN-SS解决方案。

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) provide efficient representations of high-dimensional
data, yet identification of the optimal TN structures, the so called tensor
network structure search (TN-SS) problem, remains a challenge. Current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms are computationally expensive as they
require extensive function evaluations, which is prohibitive for real-world
applications. In addition, existing methods ignore valuable domain information
inherent in real-world tensor data and lack transparency in their identified TN
structures. To this end, we propose a novel TN-SS framework, termed the tnLLM,
which incorporates domain information about the data and harnesses the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to directly predict
suitable TN structures. The proposed framework involves a domain-aware
prompting pipeline which instructs the LLM to infer suitable TN structures
based on the real-world relationships between tensor modes. In this way, our
approach is capable of not only iteratively optimizing the objective function,
but also generating domain-aware explanations for the identified structures.
Experimental results demonstrate that tnLLM achieves comparable TN-SS objective
function values with much fewer function evaluations compared to SOTA
algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLM-enabled domain information
can be used to find good initializations in the search space for sampling-based
SOTA methods to accelerate their convergence while preserving theoretical
performance guarantees.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的强化学习框架SPO，通过中粒度段级优势估计，平衡了细粒度和粗粒度方法的不足，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在优势估计粒度上存在两极分化，细粒度方法（如PPO）因难以训练准确的评论家模型而估计不准确，粗粒度方法（如GRPO）仅依赖最终奖励导致信用分配不精确。

Method: SPO框架包含三个创新策略：灵活的段划分、准确的段优势估计、以及基于段优势的策略优化（包括概率掩码策略）。具体实现包括SPO-chain（短链推理）和SPO-tree（长链推理）。

Result: SPO在GSM8K上比PPO和GRPO准确率提升6-12个百分点，在MATH500上比GRPO提升7-11个百分点。

Conclusion: SPO通过中粒度优势估计，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力，并在多个任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively
using reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing
approaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities:
Token-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide the fine-grained advantage
signals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training
an accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g.,
GRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward,
leading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we
propose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages
segment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a
better balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level
methods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods,
enabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a
critic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible
segment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy
optimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask
strategy. We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain
for short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and
chain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point
improvements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K. (2) SPO-tree for long CoT,
featuring novel tree-based advantage estimation, which significantly reduces
the cost of MC estimation, achieving $7$-$11$ percentage point improvements
over GRPO on MATH500 under 2K and 4K context evaluation. We make our code
publicly available at https://github.com/AIFrameResearch/SPO.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are fundamental to align large language
models with human preferences and to enhance their reasoning capabilities.
However, current reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from training
instability due to loose on-policy constraints and computational inefficiency
due to auxiliary models. In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal
reward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm
designed to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact
on-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and
enhances exploration. Moreover, OPO introduces the optimal reward baseline that
theoretically minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and
training stability without additional models or regularization terms.
Furthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy,
encouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight
OPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in
large language model alignment and reasoning tasks. The implementation is
provided at https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/opo.

Motivation: 尽管DPO在实证中表现良好，但其对数比率奖励参数化的理论依据尚不完整。本文旨在填补这一空白，并通过DID提供更深入的理论解释。

Method: 利用DID分析偏好标签如何编码差分信息，推导出DPO对数比率奖励的最优性，并探讨其对策略分布的影响。

Result: 研究发现，偏好标签编码差分信息时，DPO的对数比率奖励是最优形式；同时，高熵差分信息对通用指令跟随至关重要，低熵差分信息则有利于知识密集型问答。

Conclusion: 本文为DPO目标、偏好数据结构和策略行为提供了统一的视角，揭示了差分信息在偏好优化中的核心作用。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for
aligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite
its empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio
reward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap
by utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution
over token sequences that captures the information gained during policy
updates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential
information required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the
log-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the
target policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a
closed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected
responses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode
differential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption
regarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in
preference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the
entropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential
information reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential
information induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood
displacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic
experiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our
results suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial
for general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential
information benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work
presents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of
preference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of
differential information.

Result: 在三个数据集、三种模型和多种分布偏移下，TTA平均减少预测集大小10%-14%。

Conclusion: TTA是保形分类器流程中的有效补充，尤其在需要减少预测集大小时。

Abstract: A conformal classifier produces a set of predicted classes and provides a
probabilistic guarantee that the set includes the true class. Unfortunately, it
is often the case that conformal classifiers produce uninformatively large
sets. In this work, we show that test-time augmentation (TTA)--a technique that
introduces inductive biases during inference--reduces the size of the sets
produced by conformal classifiers. Our approach is flexible, computationally
efficient, and effective. It can be combined with any conformal score, requires
no model retraining, and reduces prediction set sizes by 10%-14% on average. We
conduct an evaluation of the approach spanning three datasets, three models,
two established conformal scoring methods, different guarantee strengths, and
several distribution shifts to show when and why test-time augmentation is a
useful addition to the conformal pipeline.

Conclusion: 本文提供了λ的设定指导，并展示了正则化k-means在非理想聚类下的表现。

Abstract: Finding the number of meaningful clusters in an unlabeled dataset is
important in many applications. Regularized k-means algorithm is a possible
approach frequently used to find the correct number of distinct clusters in
datasets. The most common formulation of the regularization function is the
additive linear term $\lambda k$, where $k$ is the number of clusters and
$\lambda$ a positive coefficient. Currently, there are no principled guidelines
for setting a value for the critical hyperparameter $\lambda$. In this paper,
we derive rigorous bounds for $\lambda$ assuming clusters are {\em ideal}.
Ideal clusters (defined as $d$-dimensional spheres with identical radii) are
close proxies for k-means clusters ($d$-dimensional spherically symmetric
distributions with identical standard deviations). Experiments show that the
k-means algorithm with additive regularizer often yields multiple solutions.
Thus, we also analyze k-means algorithm with multiplicative regularizer. The
consensus among k-means solutions with additive and multiplicative
regularizations reduces the ambiguity of multiple solutions in certain cases.
We also present selected experiments that demonstrate performance of the
regularized k-means algorithms as clusters deviate from the ideal assumption.

Abstract: The subpopulationtion shift, characterized by a disparity in subpopulation
distributibetween theween the training and target datasets, can significantly
degrade the performance of machine learning models. Current solutions to
subpopulation shift involve modifying empirical risk minimization with
re-weighting strategies to improve generalization. This strategy relies on
assumptions about the number and nature of subpopulations and annotations on
group membership, which are unavailable for many real-world datasets. Instead,
we propose using an ensemble of diverse classifiers to adaptively capture risk
associated with subpopulations. Given a feature extractor network, we replace
its standard linear classification layer with a mixture of prototypical
classifiers, where each member is trained to classify the data while focusing
on different features and samples from other members. In empirical evaluation
on nine real-world datasets, covering diverse domains and kinds of
subpopulation shift, our method of Diverse Prototypical Ensembles (DPEs) often
outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in worst-group accuracy. The code is

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain performance when deployed on
data distributions different from their training data, particularly in
real-world applications where environmental conditions frequently change. While
Multi-source Domain Generalization (MDG) has shown promise in addressing this
challenge by leveraging multiple source domains during training, its practical
application is limited by the significant costs and difficulties associated
with creating multi-domain datasets. To address this limitation, we propose
Pseudo Multi-source Domain Generalization (PMDG), a novel framework that
enables the application of sophisticated MDG algorithms in more practical
Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) settings. PMDG generates multiple
pseudo-domains from a single source domain through style transfer and data
augmentation techniques, creating a synthetic multi-domain dataset that can be
used with existing MDG algorithms. Through extensive experiments with
PseudoDomainBed, our modified version of the DomainBed benchmark, we analyze
the effectiveness of PMDG across multiple datasets and architectures. Our
analysis reveals several key findings, including a positive correlation between
MDG and PMDG performance and the potential of pseudo-domains to match or exceed
actual multi-domain performance with sufficient data. These comprehensive
empirical results provide valuable insights for future research in domain
generalization. Our code is available at

TLDR: 论文提出了一种无需内存缓冲区的后处理OOD检测方法，用于开放世界中的类增量学习，性能与基于缓冲区的方法相当或更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界中的类增量学习需要处理未知类别的输入，现有方法依赖内存缓冲区，存在隐私、扩展性和训练时间问题。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny ImageNet数据集上，该方法性能与基于缓冲区的方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 后处理OOD检测方法为高效且隐私保护的开放世界类增量学习系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) poses significant challenges in open-world
scenarios, where models must not only learn new classes over time without
forgetting previous ones but also handle inputs from unknown classes that a
closed-set model would misclassify. Recent works address both issues by
(i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework,
and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD)
detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a
memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and
increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of
post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the
need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied
appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for
buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves
comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of
class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples. Experimental
results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets support our findings,
offering new insights into the design of efficient and privacy-preserving CIL
systems for open-world settings.

*Pirzada Suhail,Rehna Afroz,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出了一种结合网络反演和分类器训练的新框架，用于同时解决OOD检测和不确定性估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，意外输入不可避免，OOD检测和不确定性估计对构建安全的机器学习系统至关重要。

Method: 通过引入“垃圾”类别并迭代训练、反演和排除，使分类器学习有意义的决策边界。

Result: 模型能有效检测和拒绝OOD样本，并提供不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部OOD数据集或后校准技术，为OOD检测和不确定性估计提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and uncertainty estimation (UE) are
critical components for building safe machine learning systems, especially in
real-world scenarios where unexpected inputs are inevitable. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that combines network inversion with classifier
training to simultaneously address both OOD detection and uncertainty
estimation. For a standard n-class classification task, we extend the
classifier to an (n+1)-class model by introducing a "garbage" class, initially
populated with random gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. After each
training epoch, we use network inversion to reconstruct input images
corresponding to all output classes that initially appear as noisy and
incoherent and are therefore excluded to the garbage class for retraining the
classifier. This cycle of training, inversion, and exclusion continues
iteratively till the inverted samples begin to resemble the in-distribution
data more closely, suggesting that the classifier has learned to carve out
meaningful decision boundaries while sanitising the class manifolds by pushing
OOD content into the garbage class. During inference, this training scheme
enables the model to effectively detect and reject OOD samples by classifying
them into the garbage class. Furthermore, the confidence scores associated with
each prediction can be used to estimate uncertainty for both in-distribution
and OOD inputs. Our approach is scalable, interpretable, and does not require
access to external OOD datasets or post-hoc calibration techniques while
providing a unified solution to the dual challenges of OOD detection and
uncertainty estimation.

Result: Muddit在质量和效率上均优于更大的自回归模型，展示了离散扩散的潜力。

Conclusion: 离散扩散结合强视觉先验是统一生成模型的可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified generation models aim to handle diverse tasks across modalities --
such as text generation, image generation, and vision-language reasoning --
within a single architecture and decoding paradigm. Autoregressive unified
models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and
non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to
limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion
transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and
image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch,
Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone
with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal
generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger
autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the
potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual
priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.

Result: HDRQ方法在量化过程中最小化对预训练模型的偏离，并平滑损失表面，实验证明其有效性。

Conclusion: HDRQ是首个针对量化模型合并问题的解决方案，实验验证了其在多目标域适应中的优越性。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a powerful technique for combining task-specific
weights, achieving superior performance in multi-target domain adaptation.
However, when applied to practical scenarios, such as quantized models, new
challenges arise. In practical scenarios, quantization is often applied to
target-specific data, but this process restricts the domain of interest and
introduces discretization effects, making model merging highly non-trivial. In
this study, we analyze the impact of quantization on model merging through the
lens of error barriers. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel
post-training quantization, HDRQ - Hessian and distant regularizing
quantization - that is designed to consider model merging for multi-target
domain adaptation. Our approach ensures that the quantization process incurs
minimal deviation from the source pre-trained model while flattening the loss
surface to facilitate smooth model merging. To our knowledge, this is the first
study on this challenge, and extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness.

TLDR: 论文提出REOrder框架，通过信息论和强化学习优化图像补丁顺序，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列模型对图像补丁顺序敏感，固定顺序（如行优先）可能影响性能，需探索任务最优顺序。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1) 基于信息论评估补丁序列压缩性；2) 使用REINFORCE优化Plackett-Luce策略学习顺序。

Result: REOrder在ImageNet-1K和Functional Map of the World上分别提升3.01%和13.35%的准确率。

Conclusion: 优化补丁顺序能显著提升模型性能，REOrder为任务定制顺序提供有效方法。

Abstract: Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as
one-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images
using a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is
permutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on
architectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce
sensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects
model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major
or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we
propose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch
orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the
compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over
permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This
approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space.
REOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to
3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.

*Yupei Li,Shuaijie Shao,Manuel Milling,Björn W. Schuller*

Main category: cs.HC

TLDR: 论文提出了一种结合多模态数据和心理学知识的大型语言模型（LLM）方法，用于抑郁症检测，显著提升了诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症检测通常依赖文本数据，忽视了非语言线索（如语音和行为），且缺乏心理学专业知识支持，导致诊断效果不佳。

Method: 利用DAIC-WOZ数据集，提取音频特征（Wav2Vec模型），结合文本LLM处理，并通过问答形式注入心理学知识。

Result: 相比基线方法，提出的方法在MAE和RMSE指标上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 多模态数据和心理学知识的结合能有效提升抑郁症检测的准确性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Depression is a growing concern gaining attention in both public discourse
and AI research. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used for
recognition, they still lack real-world effectiveness. Large language models
(LLMs) show strong potential but require domain-specific fine-tuning and
struggle with non-textual cues. Since depression is often expressed through
vocal tone and behaviour rather than explicit text, relying on language alone
is insufficient. Diagnostic accuracy also suffers without incorporating
psychological expertise. To address these limitations, we present, to the best
of our knowledge, the first application of LLMs to multimodal depression
detection using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. We extract the audio features using the
pre-trained model Wav2Vec, and mapped it to text-based LLMs for further
processing. We also propose a novel strategy for incorporating psychological
knowledge into LLMs to enhance diagnostic performance, specifically using a
question and answer set to grant authorised knowledge to LLMs. Our approach
yields a notable improvement in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) compared to a base score proposed by the related original
paper. The codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特殊教育等敏感环境中，标准化问卷和自动化方法难以准确评估学生抑郁情况，且缺乏教师共情带来的个性化洞察。

Method: 提出HEAE框架，整合学生叙述文本和教师衍生的9维“共情向量”，通过多模态融合和分类架构优化实现抑郁严重程度分类。

Result: 实验显示，HEAE在7级抑郁严重程度分类中达到82.74%的准确率。

Conclusion: HEAE为情感计算提供了一种更负责任和伦理的路径，通过结构化嵌入人类共情提升评估效果。

Abstract: Assessing student depression in sensitive environments like special education
is challenging. Standardized questionnaires may not fully reflect students'
true situations. Furthermore, automated methods often falter with rich student
narratives, lacking the crucial, individualized insights stemming from
teachers' empathetic connections with students. Existing methods often fail to
address this ambiguity or effectively integrate educator understanding. To
address these limitations by fostering a synergistic human-AI collaboration,
this paper introduces Human Empathy as Encoder (HEAE), a novel, human-centered
AI framework for transparent and socially responsible depression severity
assessment. Our approach uniquely integrates student narrative text with a
teacher-derived, 9-dimensional "Empathy Vector" (EV), its dimensions guided by
the PHQ-9 framework,to explicitly translate tacit empathetic insight into a
structured AI input enhancing rather than replacing human judgment. Rigorous
experiments optimized the multimodal fusion, text representation, and
classification architecture, achieving 82.74% accuracy for 7-level severity
classification. This work demonstrates a path toward more responsible and
ethical affective computing by structurally embedding human empathy

TLDR: MAC-Gaze提出了一种基于运动感知的持续校准方法，通过智能手机IMU传感器和持续学习技术动态更新视线跟踪模型，显著提升了移动场景下的视线估计准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性校准方法无法适应动态变化的用户姿势和设备方向，导致性能下降。

Method: 结合预训练的视觉视线估计器和IMU活动识别模型，采用基于聚类的混合决策机制触发重新校准，并通过基于回放的持续学习避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在RGBDGaze数据集上误差降低19.9%（1.73 cm至1.41 cm），在MotionGaze数据集上降低31.7%（2.81 cm至1.92 cm）。

Conclusion: MAC-Gaze为移动场景下的视线估计提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile gaze tracking faces a fundamental challenge: maintaining accuracy as
users naturally change their postures and device orientations. Traditional
calibration approaches, like one-off, fail to adapt to these dynamic
conditions, leading to degraded performance over time. We present MAC-Gaze, a
Motion-Aware continual Calibration approach that leverages smartphone Inertial
measurement unit (IMU) sensors and continual learning techniques to
automatically detect changes in user motion states and update the gaze tracking
model accordingly. Our system integrates a pre-trained visual gaze estimator
and an IMU-based activity recognition model with a clustering-based hybrid
decision-making mechanism that triggers recalibration when motion patterns
deviate significantly from previously encountered states. To enable
accumulative learning of new motion conditions while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting, we employ replay-based continual learning, allowing the model to
maintain performance across previously encountered motion conditions. We
evaluate our system through extensive experiments on the publicly available
RGBDGaze dataset and our own 10-hour multimodal MotionGaze dataset (481K+
images, 800K+ IMU readings), encompassing a wide range of postures under
various motion conditions including sitting, standing, lying, and walking.
Results demonstrate that our method reduces gaze estimation error by 19.9% on
RGBDGaze (from 1.73 cm to 1.41 cm) and by 31.7% on MotionGaze (from 2.81 cm to
1.92 cm) compared to traditional calibration approaches. Our framework provides
a robust solution for maintaining gaze estimation accuracy in mobile scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在构建脑网络时存在主观性、工作流程繁琐及无法捕捉复杂拓扑特征等问题，需要一种更高效、自动化的解决方案。

Method: 结合模板网络、扩散模型和图卷积网络分类器，从DTI扫描中提取拓扑特征并生成全面的脑网络。

Result: 实验验证表明，ConnectomeDiffuser在捕捉结构连接性和病理信息方面优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经退行性疾病的诊断和治疗监测提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Brain network analysis plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing
approaches for constructing structural brain networks from diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI) often rely on specialized toolkits that suffer from inherent
limitations: operator subjectivity, labor-intensive workflows, and restricted
capacity to capture complex topological features and disease-specific
biomarkers. To overcome these challenges and advance computational neuroimaging
instrumentation, ConnectomeDiffuser is proposed as a novel diffusion-based
framework for automated end-to-end brain network construction from DTI. The
proposed model combines three key components: (1) a Template Network that
extracts topological features from 3D DTI scans using Riemannian geometric
principles, (2) a diffusion model that generates comprehensive brain networks
with enhanced topological fidelity, and (3) a Graph Convolutional Network
classifier that incorporates disease-specific markers to improve diagnostic
accuracy. ConnectomeDiffuser demonstrates superior performance by capturing a
broader range of structural connectivity and pathology-related information,
enabling more sensitive analysis of individual variations in brain networks.
Experimental validation on datasets representing two distinct neurodegenerative
conditions demonstrates significant performance improvements over other brain
network methods. This work contributes to the advancement of instrumentation in
the context of neurological disorders, providing clinicians and researchers
with a robust, generalizable measurement framework that facilitates more
accurate diagnosis, deeper mechanistic understanding, and improved therapeutic
monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

Result: 线性回归器在数据集上达到90%的相关性，优于现有深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为非参数化虚拟人动画提供了有效的质量评估手段。

Abstract: Virtual human animations have a wide range of applications in virtual and
augmented reality. While automatic generation methods of animated virtual
humans have been developed, assessing their quality remains challenging.
Recently, approaches introducing task-oriented evaluation metrics have been
proposed, leveraging neural network training. However, quality assessment
measures for animated virtual humans that are not generated with parametric
body models have yet to be developed. In this context, we introduce a first
such quality assessment measure leveraging a novel data-driven framework.
First, we generate a dataset of virtual human animations together with their
corresponding subjective realism evaluation scores collected with a user study.
Second, we use the resulting dataset to learn predicting perceptual evaluation
scores. Results indicate that training a linear regressor on our dataset
results in a correlation of 90%, which outperforms a state of the art deep
learning baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM从知识提供者转变为行动执行者，其恶意使用风险增加，现有方法在安全对齐上存在不足。

Method: 利用抽象行为链在模拟环境中合成安全对齐数据，平衡安全性和实用性。

Result: 在AgentHarm评估中，安全性提升35.8%至79.5%，且实用性几乎不受影响。

Conclusion: AgentAlign有效解决了LLM代理的安全对齐问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The acquisition of agentic capabilities has transformed LLMs from "knowledge
providers" to "action executors", a trend that while expanding LLMs' capability
boundaries, significantly increases their susceptibility to malicious use.
Previous work has shown that current LLM-based agents execute numerous
malicious tasks even without being attacked, indicating a deficiency in agentic
use safety alignment during the post-training phase. To address this gap, we
propose AgentAlign, a novel framework that leverages abstract behavior chains
as a medium for safety alignment data synthesis. By instantiating these
behavior chains in simulated environments with diverse tool instances, our
framework enables the generation of highly authentic and executable
instructions while capturing complex multi-step dynamics. The framework further
ensures model utility by proportionally synthesizing benign instructions
through non-malicious interpretations of behavior chains, precisely calibrating
the boundary between helpfulness and harmlessness. Evaluation results on
AgentHarm demonstrate that fine-tuning three families of open-source models
using our method substantially improves their safety (35.8% to 79.5%
improvement) while minimally impacting or even positively enhancing their
helpfulness, outperforming various prompting methods. The dataset and code have
both been open-sourced.

Result: 实验表明AdvOF能有效降低代理性能，同时最小化对正常导航任务的干扰。

Conclusion: 该研究提升了VLM导航系统的服务安全性理解，为实际部署中的鲁棒服务组合提供了计算基础。

Abstract: We present Adversarial Object Fusion (AdvOF), a novel attack framework
targeting vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents in service-oriented
environments by generating adversarial 3D objects. While foundational models
like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
enhanced service-oriented navigation systems through improved perception and
decision-making, their integration introduces vulnerabilities in
mission-critical service workflows. Existing adversarial attacks fail to
address service computing contexts, where reliability and quality-of-service
(QoS) are paramount. We utilize AdvOF to investigate and explore the impact of
adversarial environments on the VLM-based perception module of VLN agents. In
particular, AdvOF first precisely aggregates and aligns the victim object
positions in both 2D and 3D space, defining and rendering adversarial objects.
Then, we collaboratively optimize the adversarial object with regularization
between the adversarial and victim object across physical properties and VLM
perceptions. Through assigning importance weights to varying views, the
optimization is processed stably and multi-viewedly by iterative fusions from
local updates and justifications. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate AdvOF
can effectively degrade agent performance under adversarial conditions while
maintaining minimal interference with normal navigation tasks. This work
advances the understanding of service security in VLM-powered navigation
systems, providing computational foundations for robust service composition in
physical-world deployments.

Result: 提出新框架，但指出LLM架构可能无法完全实现对话对齐。

Conclusion: AI对话代理需进一步优化以实现与人类沟通规范的对齐。

Abstract: The development of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) conversational
agents based on large language models raises important questions about the
relationship between human norms, values, and practices and AI design and
performance. This article explores what it means for AI agents to be
conversationally aligned to human communicative norms and practices for
handling context and common ground and proposes a new framework for evaluating
developers' design choices. We begin by drawing on the philosophical and
linguistic literature on conversational pragmatics to motivate a set of
desiderata, which we call the CONTEXT-ALIGN framework, for conversational
alignment with human communicative practices. We then suggest that current
large language model (LLM) architectures, constraints, and affordances may
impose fundamental limitations on achieving full conversational alignment.

Motivation: 现有NL2SQL技术未利用数据库中已有的历史查询负载信息，而这些信息（如常见连接路径和表/列语义）对翻译准确性有帮助。

Method: TailorSQL通过分析历史查询负载，提取有用信息（如常见连接路径和表/列语义），结合预训练大语言模型生成更准确的SQL查询。

Result: TailorSQL在标准化基准测试中实现了高达2倍的执行准确率提升。

Conclusion: 利用历史查询负载信息可以显著提升NL2SQL的性能，TailorSQL展示了这一方法的有效性。

Abstract: NL2SQL (natural language to SQL) translates natural language questions into
SQL queries, thereby making structured data accessible to non-technical users,
serving as the foundation for intelligent data applications. State-of-the-art
NL2SQL techniques typically perform translation by retrieving database-specific
information, such as the database schema, and invoking a pre-trained large
language model (LLM) using the question and retrieved information to generate
the SQL query.
  However, existing NL2SQL techniques miss a key opportunity which is present
in real-world settings: NL2SQL is typically applied on existing databases which
have already served many SQL queries in the past. The past query workload
implicitly contains information which is helpful for accurate NL2SQL
translation and is not apparent from the database schema alone, such as common
join paths and the semantics of obscurely-named tables and columns. We
introduce TailorSQL, a NL2SQL system that takes advantage of information in the
past query workload to improve both the accuracy and latency of translating
natural language questions into SQL. By specializing to a given workload,
TailorSQL achieves up to 2$\times$ improvement in execution accuracy on
standardized benchmarks.

Abstract: Perfusion imaging is extensively utilized to assess hemodynamic status and
tissue perfusion in various organs. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging
plays a key role in the early assessment and planning of stroke treatment.
While CTP provides essential perfusion parameters to identify abnormal blood
flow in the brain, the use of contrast agents in CTP can lead to allergic
reactions and adverse side effects, along with costing USD 4.9 billion
worldwide in 2022. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep
learning framework called Multitask Automated Generation of Intermodal CT
perfusion maps (MAGIC). This framework combines generative artificial
intelligence and physiological information to map non-contrast computed
tomography (CT) imaging to multiple contrast-free CTP imaging maps. We
demonstrate enhanced image fidelity by incorporating physiological
characteristics into the loss terms. Our network was trained and validated
using CT image data from patients referred for stroke at UF Health and
demonstrated robustness to abnormalities in brain perfusion activity. A
double-blinded study was conducted involving seven experienced

TLDR: CF-DETR通过粗到细的Transformer架构和实时调度框架NPFP**，解决了多DETR任务在自动驾驶系统中的实时性和准确性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中，多DETR任务的并发执行难以满足实时性和高精度要求，现有调度方法未充分利用Transformer特性。

Method: 提出CF-DETR系统，包含粗到细推理、选择性细推理、多级批量推理策略，以及NPFP**调度框架。

Result: 在服务器、GPU嵌入式平台和实际AV平台上，CF-DETR成功满足关键操作的实时性要求，并显著提高了检测精度。

Conclusion: CF-DETR通过动态调整策略和专用调度框架，有效平衡了实时性和精度，适用于自动驾驶感知系统。

Abstract: Detection Transformers (DETR) are increasingly adopted in autonomous vehicle
(AV) perception systems due to their superior accuracy over convolutional
networks. However, concurrently executing multiple DETR tasks presents
significant challenges in meeting firm real-time deadlines (R1) and high
accuracy requirements (R2), particularly for safety-critical objects, while
navigating the inherent latency-accuracy trade-off under resource constraints.
Existing real-time DNN scheduling approaches often treat models generically,
failing to leverage Transformer-specific properties for efficient resource
allocation. To address these challenges, we propose CF-DETR, an integrated
system featuring a novel coarse-to-fine Transformer architecture and a
dedicated real-time scheduling framework NPFP**. CF-DETR employs three key
strategies (A1: coarse-to-fine inference, A2: selective fine inference, A3:
multi-level batch inference) that exploit Transformer properties to dynamically
adjust patch granularity and attention scope based on object criticality,
aiming to satisfy R2. The NPFP** scheduling framework (A4) orchestrates these
adaptive mechanisms A1-A3. It partitions each DETR task into a safety-critical
coarse subtask for guaranteed critical object detection within its deadline
(ensuring R1), and an optional fine subtask for enhanced overall accuracy (R2),
while managing individual and batched execution. Our extensive evaluations on
server, GPU-enabled embedded platforms, and actual AV platforms demonstrate
that CF-DETR, under an NPFP** policy, successfully meets strict timing
guarantees for critical operations and achieves significantly higher overall
and critical object detection accuracy compared to existing baselines across
diverse AV workloads.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新颖的增量关系引导分割（IRS）学习方案，用于处理数字病理学中时间获取、部分标注的数据，同时保持分布外（OOD）持续学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字病理学中的全景分割面临标注不完整和持续学习需求的挑战，需开发能适应新表型、未知疾病和多样人群的模型。

Method: IRS通过数学建模解剖关系，利用增量通用命题矩阵实现空间-时间OOD持续学习。

Result: 实验表明IRS能有效处理多尺度病理分割，实现精确的肾脏分割和OOD病变识别。

Conclusion: IRS显著提升领域泛化能力，适用于实际数字病理学应用。

Abstract: Continual learning is rapidly emerging as a key focus in computer vision,
aiming to develop AI systems capable of continuous improvement, thereby
enhancing their value and practicality in diverse real-world applications. In
healthcare, continual learning holds great promise for continuously acquired
digital pathology data, which is collected in hospitals on a daily basis.
However, panoramic segmentation on digital whole slide images (WSIs) presents
significant challenges, as it is often infeasible to obtain comprehensive
annotations for all potential objects, spanning from coarse structures (e.g.,
regions and unit objects) to fine structures (e.g., cells). This results in
temporally and partially annotated data, posing a major challenge in developing
a holistic segmentation framework. Moreover, an ideal segmentation model should
incorporate new phenotypes, unseen diseases, and diverse populations, making
this task even more complex. In this paper, we introduce a novel and unified
Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation (IRS) learning scheme to address
temporally acquired, partially annotated data while maintaining
out-of-distribution (OOD) continual learning capacity in digital pathology. The
key innovation of IRS lies in its ability to realize a new spatial-temporal OOD
continual learning paradigm by mathematically modeling anatomical relationships
between existing and newly introduced classes through a simple incremental
universal proposition matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that the IRS
method effectively handles the multi-scale nature of pathological segmentation,
enabling precise kidney segmentation across various structures (regions, units,
and cells) as well as OOD disease lesions at multiple magnifications. This
capability significantly enhances domain generalization, making IRS a robust
approach for real-world digital pathology applications.

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: 提出了一种名为iHDR的迭代融合框架，用于处理动态场景下高动态范围（HDR）成像问题，支持灵活输入帧数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR成像方法通常仅适用于固定输入帧数，无法灵活应对不同场景需求。

Method: iHDR框架包含两个网络：DiHDR（双输入HDR融合网络）和ToneNet（物理域映射网络），通过迭代融合逐步生成HDR图像。

Result: 实验表明，iHDR在灵活输入帧数下优于现有HDR去鬼影方法。

Conclusion: iHDR提供了一种灵活且高效的HDR成像解决方案。

Abstract: High dynamic range (HDR) imaging aims to obtain a high-quality HDR image by
fusing information from multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images. Numerous
learning-based HDR imaging methods have been proposed to achieve this for
static and dynamic scenes. However, their architectures are mostly tailored for
a fixed number (e.g., three) of inputs and, therefore, cannot apply directly to
situations beyond the pre-defined limited scope. To address this issue, we
propose a novel framework, iHDR, for iterative fusion, which comprises a
ghost-free Dual-input HDR fusion network (DiHDR) and a physics-based domain
mapping network (ToneNet). DiHDR leverages a pair of inputs to estimate an
intermediate HDR image, while ToneNet maps it back to the nonlinear domain and
serves as the reference input for the next pairwise fusion. This process is
iteratively executed until all input frames are utilized. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
as compared to existing state-of-the-art HDR deghosting approaches given
flexible numbers of input frames.

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种结合深度展开（unrolling）和即插即用（PnP）方法优势的解决方案，通过设计高效的深度图像恢复器（DIR）和提出通用的近端轨迹（PT）损失函数，实现了在单像素成像（SPI）逆问题中灵活处理不同压缩比（CR）的同时，提升了重建精度和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PnP方法在重建精度和速度上的不足，以及展开方法在压缩比变化时需要微调或重新训练的问题。

Method: 设计了高效的深度图像恢复器（DIR）用于HQS和ADMM的展开，并提出了通用的近端轨迹（PT）损失函数来训练网络。

Result: 实验表明，提出的近端展开网络不仅能灵活处理不同压缩比，还在重建精度和速度上优于之前的压缩比特定展开网络。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了PnP和展开方法的优势，为单像素成像逆问题提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep-unrolling and plug-and-play (PnP) approaches have become the de-facto
standard solvers for single-pixel imaging (SPI) inverse problem. PnP
approaches, a class of iterative algorithms where regularization is implicitly
performed by an off-the-shelf deep denoiser, are flexible for varying
compression ratios (CRs) but are limited in reconstruction accuracy and speed.
Conversely, unrolling approaches, a class of multi-stage neural networks where
a truncated iterative optimization process is transformed into an end-to-end
trainable network, typically achieve better accuracy with faster inference but
require fine-tuning or even retraining when CR changes. In this paper, we
address the challenge of integrating the strengths of both classes of solvers.
To this end, we design an efficient deep image restorer (DIR) for the unrolling
of HQS (half quadratic splitting) and ADMM (alternating direction method of
multipliers). More importantly, a general proximal trajectory (PT) loss
function is proposed to train HQS/ADMM-unrolling networks such that learned DIR
approximates the proximal operator of an ideal explicit restoration
regularizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, the resulting proximal
unrolling networks can not only flexibly handle varying CRs with a single model
like PnP algorithms, but also outperform previous CR-specific unrolling
networks in both reconstruction accuracy and speed. Source codes and models are

Abstract: Remote sensing image super-resolution (RSISR) is a crucial task in remote
sensing image processing, aiming to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images
from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Despite the growing number of
RSISR methods proposed in recent years, a systematic and comprehensive review
of these methods is still lacking. This paper presents a thorough review of
RSISR algorithms, covering methodologies, datasets, and evaluation metrics. We
provide an in-depth analysis of RSISR methods, categorizing them into
supervised, unsupervised, and quality evaluation approaches, to help
researchers understand current trends and challenges. Our review also discusses
the strengths, limitations, and inherent challenges of these techniques.
Notably, our analysis reveals significant limitations in existing methods,
particularly in preserving fine-grained textures and geometric structures under
large-scale degradation. Based on these findings, we outline future research
directions, highlighting the need for domain-specific architectures and robust
evaluation protocols to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world RSISR
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中，模型在未见数据集上的外部有效性不足，尤其在超声图像领域。现有方法（如域适应和GAN风格迁移）在小规模多样化数据集上效果有限。

Method: 使用PCA预处理降噪并保留90%数据集方差，生成PCA重建数据集。在六个乳腺肿瘤超声数据集上训练U-Net模型，比较原始图像与PCA数据集的表现。

Result: PCA重建数据集显著提升了召回率（0.57→0.70）和Dice分数（0.50→0.58），外部验证召回率下降减少33%。

Conclusion: PCA重建可作为提升医学图像分割外部有效性的有效方法，尤其在挑战性案例中表现突出。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, limited external validity remains a critical
obstacle when models are deployed across unseen datasets, an issue particularly
pronounced in the ultrasound image domain. Existing solutions-such as domain
adaptation and GAN-based style transfer-while promising, often fall short in
the medical domain where datasets are typically small and diverse. This paper
presents a novel application of principal component analysis (PCA) to address
this limitation. PCA preprocessing reduces noise and emphasizes essential
features by retaining approximately 90\% of the dataset variance. We evaluate
our approach across six diverse breast tumor ultrasound datasets comprising
3,983 B-mode images and corresponding expert tumor segmentation masks. For each
dataset, a corresponding dimensionality reduced PCA-dataset is created and
U-Net-based segmentation models are trained on each of the twelve datasets.
Each model trained on an original dataset was inferenced on the remaining five
out-of-domain original datasets (baseline results), while each model trained on
a PCA dataset was inferenced on five out-of-domain PCA datasets. Our
experimental results indicate that using PCA reconstructed datasets, instead of
original images, improves the model's recall and Dice scores, particularly for
model-dataset pairs where baseline performance was lowest, achieving
statistically significant gains in recall (0.57 $\pm$ 0.07 vs. 0.70 $\pm$ 0.05,
$p = 0.0004$) and Dice scores (0.50 $\pm$ 0.06 vs. 0.58 $\pm$ 0.06, $p =
0.03$). Our method reduced the decline in recall values due to external
validation by $33\%$. These findings underscore the potential of PCA
reconstruction as a safeguard to mitigate declines in segmentation performance,
especially in challenging cases, with implications for enhancing external
validity in real-world medical applications.

Motivation: 准确预测非小细胞肺癌（NSCLC）的免疫治疗反应仍是一个未满足的需求，现有模型难以捕捉治疗引起的复杂形态和纹理变化。

Method: 提出ImmunoDiff，结合解剖学先验（如肺叶和血管结构）和临床数据（如PD-L1表达），通过cbi-Adapter模块实现多模态数据集成。

Result: 在NSCLC队列中，反应预测的平衡准确率提高了21.24%，生存预测的c指数增加了0.03。

Conclusion: ImmunoDiff通过整合解剖学和临床数据，显著提升了免疫治疗反应的预测性能。

Abstract: Accurately predicting immunotherapy response in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
(NSCLC) remains a critical unmet need. Existing radiomics and deep
learning-based predictive models rely primarily on pre-treatment imaging to
predict categorical response outcomes, limiting their ability to capture the
complex morphological and textural transformations induced by immunotherapy.
This study introduces ImmunoDiff, an anatomy-aware diffusion model designed to
synthesize post-treatment CT scans from baseline imaging while incorporating
clinically relevant constraints. The proposed framework integrates anatomical
priors, specifically lobar and vascular structures, to enhance fidelity in CT
synthesis. Additionally, we introduce a novel cbi-Adapter, a conditioning
module that ensures pairwise-consistent multimodal integration of imaging and
clinical data embeddings, to refine the generative process. Additionally, a
clinical variable conditioning mechanism is introduced, leveraging demographic
data, blood-based biomarkers, and PD-L1 expression to refine the generative
process. Evaluations on an in-house NSCLC cohort treated with immune checkpoint
inhibitors demonstrate a 21.24% improvement in balanced accuracy for response
prediction and a 0.03 increase in c-index for survival prediction. Code will be
released soon.

Abstract: This study explores the use of text-prompted MRI image generation with the
Stable Diffusion (SD) model to address challenges in acquiring real MRI
datasets, such as high costs, limited rare case samples, and privacy concerns.
The SD model, pre-trained on natural images, was fine-tuned using the 3T
fastMRI dataset and the 0.3T M4Raw dataset, with the goal of generating brain
T1, T2, and FLAIR images across different magnetic field strengths. The
performance of the fine-tuned model was evaluated using quantitative
metrics,including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-Scale Structural
Similarity (MS-SSIM), showing improvements in image quality and semantic
consistency with the text prompts. To further evaluate the model's potential, a
simple classification task was carried out using a small 0.35T MRI dataset,
demonstrating that the synthetic images generated by the fine-tuned SD model
can effectively augment training datasets and improve the performance of MRI
constrast classification tasks. Overall, our findings suggest that
text-prompted MRI image generation is feasible and can serve as a useful tool
for medical AI applications.

Conclusion: DeepMultiConnectome提供了一种快速、可扩展的解决方案，适用于多种分区方案的个体化连接组生成。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography enables in vivo mapping of brain structural
connections, but traditional connectome generation is time-consuming and
requires gray matter parcellation, posing challenges for large-scale studies.
We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts
structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray
matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a
point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies
streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation
schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate
DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young
Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter
parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural
connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in
approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing
predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the
conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation.
The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated
connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region
scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of
DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally
generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to
traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function.
Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating
subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖显式先验或单独参数估计，而Blind-PnPDM旨在更灵活地解决盲逆问题。

Conclusion: Blind-PnPDM通过将盲逆问题转化为去噪子问题序列，并利用扩散先验，展示了其有效性。

Abstract: We introduce Blind Plug-and-Play Diffusion Models (Blind-PnPDM) as a novel
framework for solving blind inverse problems where both the target image and
the measurement operator are unknown. Unlike conventional methods that rely on
explicit priors or separate parameter estimation, our approach performs
posterior sampling by recasting the problem into an alternating Gaussian
denoising scheme. We leverage two diffusion models as learned priors: one to
capture the distribution of the target image and another to characterize the
parameters of the measurement operator. This PnP integration of diffusion
models ensures flexibility and ease of adaptation. Our experiments on blind
image deblurring show that Blind-PnPDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both quantitative metrics and visual fidelity. Our results highlight
the effectiveness of treating blind inverse problems as a sequence of denoising
subproblems while harnessing the expressive power of diffusion-based priors.

Abstract: Quantitative susceptibility maps from magnetic resonance images can provide
both prognostic and diagnostic information in multiple sclerosis, a
neurodegenerative disease characterized by the formation of lesions in white
matter brain tissue. In particular, susceptibility maps provide adequate
contrast to distinguish between "rim" lesions, surrounded by deposited
paramagnetic iron, and "non-rim" lesion types. These paramagnetic rim lesions
(PRLs) are an emerging biomarker in multiple sclerosis. Much effort has been
devoted to both detection and segmentation of such lesions to monitor
longitudinal change. As paramagnetic rim lesions are rare, addressing this
problem requires confronting the class imbalance between rim and non-rim
lesions. We produce synthetic quantitative susceptibility maps of paramagnetic
rim lesions and show that inclusion of such synthetic data improves classifier
performance and provide a multi-channel extension to generate accompanying
contrasts and probabilistic segmentation maps. We exploit the projection
capability of our trained generative network to demonstrate a novel denoising
approach that allows us to train on ambiguous rim cases and substantially
increase the minority class. We show that both synthetic lesion synthesis and
our proposed rim lesion label denoising method best approximate the unseen rim
lesion distribution and improve detection in a clinically interpretable manner.
We release our code and generated data at https://github.com/agr78/PRLx-GAN

Result: GRPO提升执行技能但规划能力不足，合成任务证实RL主要增强执行稳健性，并探索了克服限制的条件。

Conclusion: RL能增强LLMs的执行能力，但需改进探索和泛化以突破规划能力的限制。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning tasks have become prominent benchmarks for assessing
the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, especially with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as GRPO showing significant performance gains. However, accuracy
metrics alone do not support fine-grained assessment of capabilities and fail
to reveal which problem-solving skills have been internalized. To better
understand these capabilities, we propose to decompose problem solving into
fundamental capabilities: Plan (mapping questions to sequences of steps),
Execute (correctly performing solution steps), and Verify (identifying the
correctness of a solution). Empirically, we find that GRPO mainly enhances the
execution skill-improving execution robustness on problems the model already
knows how to solve-a phenomenon we call temperature distillation. More
importantly, we show that RL-trained models struggle with fundamentally new
problems, hitting a 'coverage wall' due to insufficient planning skills. To
explore RL's impact more deeply, we construct a minimal, synthetic
solution-tree navigation task as an analogy for mathematical problem-solving.
This controlled setup replicates our empirical findings, confirming RL
primarily boosts execution robustness. Importantly, in this setting, we
identify conditions under which RL can potentially overcome the coverage wall
through improved exploration and generalization to new solution paths. Our
findings provide insights into the role of RL in enhancing LLM reasoning,
expose key limitations, and suggest a path toward overcoming these barriers.

Abstract: Systematic reviews in medicine play a critical role in evidence-based
decision-making by aggregating findings from multiple studies. A central
bottleneck in automating this process is extracting numeric evidence and
determining study-level conclusions for specific outcomes and comparisons.
Prior work has framed this problem as a textual inference task by retrieving
relevant content fragments and inferring conclusions from them. However, such
approaches often rely on shallow textual cues and fail to capture the
underlying numeric reasoning behind expert assessments.
  In this work, we conceptualise the problem as one of quantitative reasoning.
Rather than inferring conclusions from surface text, we extract structured
numerical evidence (e.g., event counts or standard deviations) and apply domain
knowledge informed logic to derive outcome-specific conclusions. We develop a
numeric reasoning system composed of a numeric data extraction model and an
effect estimate component, enabling more accurate and interpretable inference
aligned with the domain expert principles. We train the numeric data extraction
model using different strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) with a new value reward model.
  When evaluated on the CochraneForest benchmark, our best-performing approach
-- using RL to train a small-scale number extraction model -- yields up to a
21% absolute improvement in F1 score over retrieval-based systems and
outperforms general-purpose LLMs of over 400B parameters by up to 9%. Our
results demonstrate the promise of reasoning-driven approaches for automating
systematic evidence synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在推理能力上取得进展，但MLLMs和MSLMs面临多模态推理的挑战，如数据集稀缺、视觉处理导致推理能力下降等。

Method: 设计三阶段框架：基础推理激活、跨模态推理适应和多模态推理增强，逐步提升模型能力。

Result: Infi-MMR-3B在多模态数学推理（如MathVerse、MathVision）和通用推理（MathVista）测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: Infi-MMR框架有效解决了MSLMs在多模态推理中的挑战，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
substantial progress in reasoning capabilities, such as DeepSeek-R1, which
leverages rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance logical reasoning
significantly. However, extending these achievements to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more
pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically
weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality
multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities
due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct
application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect
reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework
Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a
curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal
reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning
Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and
strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase,
Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to
facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts.
The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated,
caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust
cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal
math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision
test, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on
MathVista testmini).

TLDR: 论文介绍了Socratic-PRMBench，一个系统性评估过程奖励模型（PRMs）在多种推理模式下的新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注逐步正确性，缺乏对PRMs在多种推理模式下系统性评估，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出Socratic-PRMBench，包含2995条带有缺陷的推理路径，涵盖六种推理模式。

Result: 实验发现现有PRMs在多种推理模式下存在显著不足。

Conclusion: Socratic-PRMBench可作为PRMs系统性评估的测试平台，推动未来PRMs的发展。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial in complex reasoning and
problem-solving tasks (e.g., LLM agents with long-horizon decision-making) by
verifying the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step. In real-world
scenarios, LLMs may apply various reasoning patterns (e.g., decomposition) to
solve a problem, potentially suffering from errors under various reasoning
patterns. Therefore, PRMs are required to identify errors under various
reasoning patterns during the reasoning process. However, existing benchmarks
mainly focus on evaluating PRMs with stepwise correctness, ignoring a
systematic evaluation of PRMs under various reasoning patterns. To mitigate
this gap, we introduce Socratic-PRMBench, a new benchmark to evaluate PRMs
systematically under six reasoning patterns, including Transformation,
Decomposition, Regather, Deduction, Verification, and Integration.
Socratic-PRMBench}comprises 2995 reasoning paths with flaws within the
aforementioned six reasoning patterns. Through our experiments on both PRMs and
LLMs prompted as critic models, we identify notable deficiencies in existing
PRMs. These observations underscore the significant weakness of current PRMs in
conducting evaluations on reasoning steps under various reasoning patterns. We
hope Socratic-PRMBench can serve as a comprehensive testbed for systematic
evaluation of PRMs under diverse reasoning patterns and pave the way for future
development of PRMs.

TLDR: ZeroGUI是一个在线学习框架，用于自动化GUI代理训练，无需人工标注，通过VLM生成任务和奖励，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线学习方法依赖高质量人工标注且适应性有限，ZeroGUI旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 结合VLM自动生成任务和奖励，采用两阶段在线强化学习。

Result: 在UI-TARS和Aguvis上显著提升OSWorld和AndroidLab环境性能。

Conclusion: ZeroGUI为GUI代理训练提供了一种高效、零人工成本的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has propelled
the development of pure-vision-based GUI Agents, capable of perceiving and
operating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) to autonomously fulfill user
instructions. However, existing approaches usually adopt an offline learning
framework, which faces two core limitations: (1) heavy reliance on high-quality
manual annotations for element grounding and action supervision, and (2)
limited adaptability to dynamic and interactive environments. To address these
limitations, we propose ZeroGUI, a scalable, online learning framework for
automating GUI Agent training at Zero human cost. Specifically, ZeroGUI
integrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training
goals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward
estimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions,
and (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with
and learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents
(UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance
across OSWorld and AndroidLab environments. The code is available at
https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ZeroGUI.
