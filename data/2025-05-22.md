### [1] [Text Generation Beyond Discrete Token Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14827)
*Yufan Zhuang,Liyuan Liu,Chandan Singh,Jingbo Shang,Jianfeng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种无需训练的自回归生成方法Mixture of Inputs (MoI)，通过保留丢弃的token分布信息，提升生成质量和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自回归生成中丢弃的token分布包含丰富信息，MoI旨在保留这些信息以提升模型表现。

Method: 使用贝叶斯估计方法，将token分布作为先验，采样token作为观测，生成连续后验期望作为新输入。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和博士级QA任务中，MoI显著提升了多个模型的性能，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: MoI通过保留分布信息，有效提升了生成质量和推理能力，且计算开销可忽略。

Abstract: In standard autoregressive generation, an LLM predicts the next-token
distribution, samples a discrete token, and then discards the distribution,
passing only the sampled token as new input. To preserve this distribution's
rich information, we propose Mixture of Inputs (MoI), a training-free method
for autoregressive generation. After generating a token following the standard
paradigm, we construct a new input that blends the generated discrete token
with the previously discarded token distribution. Specifically, we employ a
Bayesian estimation method that treats the token distribution as the prior, the
sampled token as the observation, and replaces the conventional one-hot vector
with the continuous posterior expectation as the new model input. MoI allows
the model to maintain a richer internal representation throughout the
generation process, resulting in improved text quality and reasoning
capabilities. On mathematical reasoning, code generation, and PhD-level QA
tasks, MoI consistently improves performance across multiple models including
QwQ-32B, Nemotron-Super-49B, Gemma-3-27B, and DAPO-Qwen-32B, with no additional
training and negligible computational overhead.

### [2] [SEPS: A Separability Measure for Robust Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14832)
*Wonje Jeung,Sangyeon Yoon,Albert No*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: SEPS是一个评估框架，用于衡量模型在单一提示中同时遗忘和保留信息的能力，解决了现有遗忘方法在混合查询场景中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘指标无法捕捉真实场景中遗忘和保留查询共存的情况，导致评估不全面。

Method: 提出Mixed Prompt (MP)遗忘策略，将遗忘和保留查询整合到统一的训练目标中。

Result: 实验表明，MP方法显著提升了遗忘效果，在复杂场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: SEPS和MP方法为机器遗忘提供了更有效的评估和实现途径。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove targeted knowledge from Large
Language Models (LLMs), ensuring they forget specified content while retaining
essential information. Existing unlearning metrics assess whether a model
correctly answers retain queries and rejects forget queries, but they fail to
capture real-world scenarios where forget queries rarely appear in isolation.
In fact, forget and retain queries often coexist within the same prompt, making
mixed-query evaluation crucial.
  We introduce SEPS, an evaluation framework that explicitly measures a model's
ability to both forget and retain information within a single prompt. Through
extensive experiments across three benchmarks, we identify two key failure
modes in existing unlearning methods: (1) untargeted unlearning
indiscriminately erases both forget and retain content once a forget query
appears, and (2) targeted unlearning overfits to single-query scenarios,
leading to catastrophic failures when handling multiple queries. To address
these issues, we propose Mixed Prompt (MP) unlearning, a strategy that
integrates both forget and retain queries into a unified training objective.
Our approach significantly improves unlearning effectiveness, demonstrating
robustness even in complex settings with up to eight mixed forget and retain
queries in a single prompt.

### [3] [A Comparative Study of Large Language Models and Human Personality Traits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14845)
*Wang Jiaqi,Wang bo,Guo fa,Cheng cheng,Yang li*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否表现出类似人类的性格特征，并比较了其与传统人格评估工具的适用性。通过行为实验发现，LLMs的性格特征具有动态性和输入依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在社交和认知领域的参与度增加，了解其是否具有类似人类的性格特征对AI发展和人机交互具有重要意义。

Method: 采用行为实验方法，包括测试-重测稳定性分析、跨变体一致性分析以及角色扮演中的性格保留研究。

Result: LLMs的性格特征表现出高变异性、输入敏感性和低内部一致性，缺乏长期稳定性。

Conclusion: LLMs的性格特征是动态且依赖外部输入的，这为构建LLM专用性格框架和推动人机交互提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like capabilities in
language comprehension and generation, becoming active participants in social
and cognitive domains. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit
personality-like traits and how these traits compare with human personality,
focusing on the applicability of conventional personality assessment tools. A
behavior-based approach was used across three empirical studies. Study 1
examined test-retest stability and found that LLMs show higher variability and
are more input-sensitive than humans, lacking long-term stability. Based on
this, we propose the Distributed Personality Framework, conceptualizing LLM
traits as dynamic and input-driven. Study 2 analyzed cross-variant consistency
in personality measures and found LLMs' responses were highly sensitive to item
wording, showing low internal consistency compared to humans. Study 3 explored
personality retention during role-playing, showing LLM traits are shaped by
prompt and parameter settings. These findings suggest that LLMs express fluid,
externally dependent personality patterns, offering insights for constructing
LLM-specific personality frameworks and advancing human-AI interaction. This
work contributes to responsible AI development and extends the boundaries of
personality psychology in the age of intelligent systems.

### [4] [MAATS: A Multi-Agent Automated Translation System Based on MQM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14848)
*Xi Wang,Jiaqian Hu,Safinah Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: MAATS是一种多代理自动翻译系统，利用MQM框架进行细粒度错误检测和翻译优化，显著优于传统单代理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统单代理翻译方法在语义准确性和上下文保真度上的不足，通过多代理分工协作提升翻译质量。

Method: 采用多个专注于不同MQM类别（如准确性、流畅性、风格、术语）的AI代理，并通过合成代理整合标注以迭代优化翻译。

Result: 在多种语言对和大型语言模型上，MAATS在自动指标和人工评估中均显著优于零样本和单代理基线，尤其在语义准确性和跨语言适应性上表现突出。

Conclusion: MAATS通过模块化代理角色与可解释的MQM维度对齐，缩小了黑盒LLM与人工翻译流程之间的差距，提升了翻译的语义和上下文保真度。

Abstract: We present MAATS, a Multi Agent Automated Translation System that leverages
the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework as a fine-grained signal
for error detection and refinement. MAATS employs multiple specialized AI
agents, each focused on a distinct MQM category (e.g., Accuracy, Fluency,
Style, Terminology), followed by a synthesis agent that integrates the
annotations to iteratively refine translations. This design contrasts with
conventional single-agent methods that rely on self-correction.
  Evaluated across diverse language pairs and Large Language Models (LLMs),
MAATS outperforms zero-shot and single-agent baselines with statistically
significant gains in both automatic metrics and human assessments. It excels
particularly in semantic accuracy, locale adaptation, and linguistically
distant language pairs. Qualitative analysis highlights its strengths in
multi-layered error diagnosis, omission detection across perspectives, and
context-aware refinement. By aligning modular agent roles with interpretable
MQM dimensions, MAATS narrows the gap between black-box LLMs and human
translation workflows, shifting focus from surface fluency to deeper semantic
and contextual fidelity.

### [5] [EasyMath: A 0-shot Math Benchmark for SLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14852)
*Drishya Karki,Michiel Kamphuis,Angelecia Frey*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: EasyMath是一个针对小型语言模型设计的数学推理基准测试，涵盖13个类别，测试了23种模型，结果显示准确率随模型规模和训练增加而提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为小型语言模型提供一个实用的数学推理评估工具，填补现有基准测试的空白。

Method: 设计了涵盖13类数学问题的基准测试，测试了23种不同规模的模型，采用零样本设置，结合精确、数值和符号检查。

Result: 模型准确率随规模和训练增加而提升，链式思考（chain-of-thought）带来小幅增益，大规模模型表现更一致。

Conclusion: EasyMath为小型语言模型的数学推理能力提供了有效评估，并展示了模型规模和训练对性能的影响。

Abstract: EasyMath is a compact benchmark for practical math reasoning in small
language models. It covers thirteen categories, from basic arithmetic and order
of operations to word problems, algebraic expressions, edge cases, and omits
specialist topics. We tested 23 models (14M to 4B parameters) using exact,
numerical, and symbolic checks on free-form answers in a zero-shot setting.
Accuracy rises with size and training, chain-of-thought adds modest gains, and
consistency improves at scale.

### [6] [Saten: Sparse Augmented Tensor Networks for Post-Training Compression of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14871)
*Ryan Solgi,Kai Zhen,Rupak Vignesh Swaminathan,Nathan Susanj,Athanasios Mouchtaris,Siegfried Kunzmann,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种稀疏增强张量网络（Saten）框架，用于在微调期间压缩预训练大语言模型（LLMs），提升压缩效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练LLMs的高秩特性及缺乏预训练数据访问权限，使得压缩其在下游任务中的应用具有挑战性。

Method: 采用稀疏增强张量网络（Saten）框架，在微调期间对LLMs进行低秩张量化压缩。

Result: 实验表明，Saten在压缩效率和准确性上均优于现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Saten框架为资源受限设备上的LLMs高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The efficient implementation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Low-rank tensor compression
techniques, such as tensor-train (TT) networks, have been widely studied for
over-parameterized neural networks. However, their applications to compress
pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks (post-training)
remains challenging due to the high-rank nature of pre-trained LLMs and the
lack of access to pretraining data. In this study, we investigate low-rank
tensorized LLMs during fine-tuning and propose sparse augmented tensor networks
(Saten) to enhance their performance. The proposed Saten framework enables full
model compression. Experimental results demonstrate that Saten enhances both
accuracy and compression efficiency in tensorized language models, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

### [7] [Towards Inclusive ASR: Investigating Voice Conversion for Dysarthric Speech Recognition in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14874)
*Chin-Jou Li,Eunjung Yeo,Kwanghee Choi,Paula Andrea Pérez-Toro,Masao Someki,Rohan Kumar Das,Zhengjun Yue,Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave,Elmar Nöth,David R. Mortensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 通过语音转换模型生成非英语的类似构音障碍语音，用于增强多语言ASR模型在构音障碍语音识别中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非英语构音障碍语音数据稀缺的问题，提升ASR模型对构音障碍语音的识别能力。

Method: 使用英语构音障碍语音（UASpeech）微调语音转换模型，生成非英语构音障碍类似语音（FLEURS），并用于微调多语言ASR模型（MMS）。

Result: 在西班牙语、意大利语和泰米尔语数据集上，该方法显著优于现成的MMS模型和传统数据增强技术。

Conclusion: 生成的语音成功模拟了构音障碍特征，显著提升了多语言ASR模型在构音障碍语音识别中的性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for dysarthric speech remains challenging
due to data scarcity, particularly in non-English languages. To address this,
we fine-tune a voice conversion model on English dysarthric speech (UASpeech)
to encode both speaker characteristics and prosodic distortions, then apply it
to convert healthy non-English speech (FLEURS) into non-English dysarthric-like
speech. The generated data is then used to fine-tune a multilingual ASR model,
Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS), for improved dysarthric speech
recognition. Evaluation on PC-GITA (Spanish), EasyCall (Italian), and SSNCE
(Tamil) demonstrates that VC with both speaker and prosody conversion
significantly outperforms the off-the-shelf MMS performance and conventional
augmentation techniques such as speed and tempo perturbation. Objective and
subjective analyses of the generated data further confirm that the generated
speech simulates dysarthric characteristics.

### [8] [Incorporating Token Usage into Prompting Strategy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14880)
*Chris Sypherd,Sergei Petrov,Sonny George,Vaishak Belle*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出Big-$O_{tok}$框架和Token Cost指标，强调提示策略的效率（性能与token用量的平衡）比单纯性能更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的性能高度依赖提示策略，但现有研究多关注性能而忽视效率（token用量）。

Method: 提出Big-$O_{tok}$理论框架和Token Cost实证指标，分析常见提示策略的token增长与性能关系。

Result: token用量增加导致性能回报急剧递减，验证了Big-$O_{tok}$框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 效率（性能与token用量的平衡）是提示策略实用性的关键，需在评估中重视。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models have demonstrated remarkable
performance across diverse tasks. However, their task effectiveness is heavily
dependent on the prompting strategy used to elicit output, which can vary
widely in both performance and token usage. While task performance is often
used to determine prompting strategy success, we argue that
efficiency--balancing performance and token usage--can be a more practical
metric for real-world utility. To enable this, we propose Big-$O_{tok}$, a
theoretical framework for describing the token usage growth of prompting
strategies, and analyze Token Cost, an empirical measure of tokens per
performance. We apply these to several common prompting strategies and find
that increased token usage leads to drastically diminishing performance
returns. Our results validate the Big-$O_{tok}$ analyses and reinforce the need
for efficiency-aware evaluations.

### [9] [Strategic Planning and Rationalizing on Trees Make LLMs Better Debaters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14886)
*Danqing Wang,Zhuorui Ye,Xinran Zhao,Fei Fang,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: TreeDebater是一个新颖的辩论框架，通过两种树结构（Rehearsal Tree和Debate Flow Tree）解决竞争性辩论中的时间限制和互动性问题，并在实验中优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性辩论需要复杂的推理和论证技能，但时间限制和互动性评估是主要挑战。

Method: 提出TreeDebater框架，包含Rehearsal Tree（评估论点强度）和Debate Flow Tree（跟踪辩论状态），并通过时间分配和观众反馈优化表现。

Result: 实验表明TreeDebater优于现有系统，且在时间分配策略上与人类专家一致。

Conclusion: TreeDebater在竞争性辩论中表现出色，尤其在时间管理和策略选择上具有优势。

Abstract: Winning competitive debates requires sophisticated reasoning and argument
skills. There are unique challenges in the competitive debate: (1) The time
constraints force debaters to make strategic choices about which points to
pursue rather than covering all possible arguments; (2) The persuasiveness of
the debate relies on the back-and-forth interaction between arguments, which a
single final game status cannot evaluate. To address these challenges, we
propose TreeDebater, a novel debate framework that excels in competitive
debate. We introduce two tree structures: the Rehearsal Tree and Debate Flow
Tree. The Rehearsal Tree anticipates the attack and defenses to evaluate the
strength of the claim, while the Debate Flow Tree tracks the debate status to
identify the active actions. TreeDebater allocates its time budget among
candidate actions and uses the speech time controller and feedback from the
simulated audience to revise its statement. The human evaluation on both the
stage-level and the debate-level comparison shows that our TreeDebater
outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-agent debate system. Further
investigation shows that TreeDebater shows better strategies in limiting time
to important debate actions, aligning with the strategies of human debate
experts.

### [10] [In-Context Learning Boosts Speech Recognition via Human-like Adaptation to Speakers and Language Varieties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14887)
*Nathan Roll,Calbert Graham,Yuka Tatsumi,Kim Tien Nguyen,Meghan Sumner,Dan Jurafsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种可扩展的框架，通过上下文学习（ICL）提升语音识别模型对陌生说话者和语言变体的适应性，仅需少量示例即可显著降低错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类听众对陌生说话者和语言变体的适应能力是否适用于最先进的语音语言模型，并探索提升模型适应性的方法。

Method: 引入一个可扩展框架，在Phi-4 Multimodal中通过交错任务提示和音频-文本对实现上下文学习（ICL）。

Result: 仅需12个示例（约50秒）即可将单词错误率相对降低19.7%，在低资源变体和匹配上下文与目标说话者时效果最佳。

Conclusion: ICL适应方案显示出与人类听众相似的性能特征，显著提升了语音识别的鲁棒性，但仍存在某些变体的适应差距。

Abstract: Human listeners readily adjust to unfamiliar speakers and language varieties
through exposure, but do these adaptation benefits extend to state-of-the-art
spoken language models? We introduce a scalable framework that allows for
in-context learning (ICL) in Phi-4 Multimodal using interleaved task prompts
and audio-text pairs, and find that as few as 12 example utterances (~50
seconds) at inference time reduce word error rates by a relative 19.7% (1.2
pp.) on average across diverse English corpora. These improvements are most
pronounced in low-resource varieties, when the context and target speaker
match, and when more examples are provided--though scaling our procedure yields
diminishing marginal returns to context length. Overall, we find that our novel
ICL adaptation scheme (1) reveals a similar performance profile to human
listeners, and (2) demonstrates consistent improvements to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) robustness across diverse speakers and language backgrounds.
While adaptation succeeds broadly, significant gaps remain for certain
varieties, revealing where current models still fall short of human
flexibility. We release our prompts and code on GitHub.

### [11] [Scaling Laws for State Dynamics in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14892)
*Jacob X Li,Shreyas S Raman,Jessica Wan,Fahad Samman,Jazlyn Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在状态跟踪任务中的表现，发现其准确性随状态空间和稀疏转移的增加而下降，并识别了关键注意力头。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在需要内部状态跟踪的任务中应用广泛，但其对状态转移动态的建模能力尚不明确。

Method: 评估了LLMs在三个领域（Box Tracking、Abstract DFA Sequences、Complex Text Games）中确定性状态动态的捕捉能力，并通过激活修补技术识别关键注意力头。

Result: GPT-2 XL在低复杂度任务中达到70%准确率，但在高复杂度任务中降至30%以下；Pythia-1B在状态数>10且转移<30时准确率低于50%。关键注意力头被识别为状态信息传播的主要节点。

Conclusion: LLMs的状态跟踪能力源于分布式交互而非显式符号计算，且状态-动作联合推理较弱。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in tasks requiring
internal state tracking, yet their ability to model state transition dynamics
remains poorly understood. We evaluate how well LLMs capture deterministic
state dynamics across 3 domains: Box Tracking, Abstract DFA Sequences, and
Complex Text Games, each formalizable as a finite-state system. Across tasks,
we find that next-state prediction accuracy degrades with increasing
state-space size and sparse transitions. GPT-2 XL reaches about 70% accuracy in
low-complexity settings but drops below 30% when the number of boxes or states
exceeds 5 or 10, respectively. In DFA tasks, Pythia-1B fails to exceed 50%
accuracy when the number of states is > 10 and transitions are < 30. Through
activation patching, we identify attention heads responsible for propagating
state information: GPT-2 XL Layer 22 Head 20, and Pythia-1B Heads at Layers 10,
11, 12, and 14. While these heads successfully move relevant state features,
action information is not reliably routed to the final token, indicating weak
joint state-action reasoning. Our results suggest that state tracking in LLMs
emerges from distributed interactions of next-token heads rather than explicit
symbolic computation.

### [12] [Concept Incongruence: An Exploration of Time and Death in Role Playing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14905)
*Xiaoyan Bai,Ike Peng,Aditya Singh,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在遇到概念冲突时的行为，提出了概念不一致性（concept incongruence）的定义，并通过实验分析了模型在角色扮演情境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解LLMs在面对用户提示或模型内部概念冲突时的行为，例如用户要求生成“双角独角兽”时，模型是否应识别定义冲突并澄清。

Method: 方法包括定义概念不一致性，提出三个行为指标（abstention rate, conditional accuracy, answer rate），并通过角色扮演实验分析模型在角色死亡后的表现。

Result: 结果显示模型在角色死亡后未能有效停止生成，且准确性下降。原因包括死亡状态编码不可靠和角色扮演导致的时间表征偏移。

Conclusion: 结论指出概念不一致性会导致模型行为异常，并提出了改进模型行为的方向。

Abstract: Consider this prompt "Draw a unicorn with two horns". Should large language
models (LLMs) recognize that a unicorn has only one horn by definition and ask
users for clarifications, or proceed to generate something anyway? We introduce
concept incongruence to capture such phenomena where concept boundaries clash
with each other, either in user prompts or in model representations, often
leading to under-specified or mis-specified behaviors. In this work, we take
the first step towards defining and analyzing model behavior under concept
incongruence. Focusing on temporal boundaries in the Role-Play setting, we
propose three behavioral metrics--abstention rate, conditional accuracy, and
answer rate--to quantify model behavior under incongruence due to the role's
death. We show that models fail to abstain after death and suffer from an
accuracy drop compared to the Non-Role-Play setting. Through probing
experiments, we identify two main causes: (i) unreliable encoding of the
"death" state across different years, leading to unsatisfactory abstention
behavior, and (ii) role playing causes shifts in the model's temporal
representations, resulting in accuracy drops. We leverage these insights to
improve consistency in the model's abstention and answer behaviors. Our
findings suggest that concept incongruence leads to unexpected model behaviors
and point to future directions on improving model behavior under concept
incongruence.

*Ye Yuan,Haolun Wu,Hao Zhou,Xue Liu,Hao Chen,Yan Xin,Jianzhong,Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于语言模型的信息提取技术TeleSEE，用于从电信领域提取结构化实体，通过高效的表示方法和分层并行解码策略提升准确性和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络中知识理解是推动网络智能化和AI原生架构的基础，而信息提取是将碎片化电信知识转化为结构化格式的关键。

Method: 提出TeleSEE技术，采用令牌高效表示方法预测实体类型和属性键，并结合分层并行解码策略优化标准编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 实验表明，TeleSEE在电信领域数据集6GTech上比其他基线技术准确率更高，样本处理速度快5至9倍。

Conclusion: TeleSEE技术在电信领域的信息提取任务中表现出色，为6G网络的知识理解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Knowledge understanding is a foundational part of envisioned 6G networks to
advance network intelligence and AI-native network architectures. In this
paradigm, information extraction plays a pivotal role in transforming
fragmented telecom knowledge into well-structured formats, empowering diverse
AI models to better understand network terminologies. This work proposes a
novel language model-based information extraction technique, aiming to extract
structured entities from the telecom context. The proposed telecom structured
entity extraction (TeleSEE) technique applies a token-efficient representation
method to predict entity types and attribute keys, aiming to save the number of
output tokens and improve prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, TeleSEE involves a
hierarchical parallel decoding method, improving the standard encoder-decoder
architecture by integrating additional prompting and decoding strategies into
entity extraction tasks. In addition, to better evaluate the performance of the
proposed technique in the telecom domain, we further designed a dataset named
6GTech, including 2390 sentences and 23747 words from more than 100 6G-related
technical publications. Finally, the experiment shows that the proposed TeleSEE
method achieves higher accuracy than other baseline techniques, and also
presents 5 to 9 times higher sample processing speed.

*Zhiwei Liu,Paul Thompson,Jiaqi Rong,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种改进的阴谋论检测方法ConspEmoLLM-v2，通过增强数据集ConDID-v2（包含LLM改写的内容），解决了LLM生成内容可能逃避检测的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）可能生成或伪装阴谋论内容，现有检测方法依赖人类文本的情感特征，容易被改写内容绕过。

Method: 开发了ConDID-v2数据集，包含人类和LLM改写的内容，并训练了改进的检测模型ConspEmoLLM-v2。

Result: ConspEmoLLM-v2在原始和改写内容上均表现优异，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过增强数据集和改进模型，可以有效检测LLM生成的伪装阴谋论内容。

Abstract: Despite the many benefits of large language models (LLMs), they can also
cause harm, e.g., through automatic generation of misinformation, including
conspiracy theories. Moreover, LLMs can also ''disguise'' conspiracy theories
by altering characteristic textual features, e.g., by transforming their
typically strong negative emotions into a more positive tone. Although several
studies have proposed automated conspiracy theory detection methods, they are
usually trained using human-authored text, whose features can vary from
LLM-generated text. Furthermore, several conspiracy detection models, including
the previously proposed ConspEmoLLM, rely heavily on the typical emotional
features of human-authored conspiracy content. As such, intentionally disguised
content may evade detection. To combat such issues, we firstly developed an
augmented version of the ConDID conspiracy detection dataset, ConDID-v2, which
supplements human-authored conspiracy tweets with versions rewritten by an LLM
to reduce the negativity of their original sentiment. The quality of the
rewritten tweets was verified by combining human and LLM-based assessment. We
subsequently used ConDID-v2 to train ConspEmoLLM-v2, an enhanced version of
ConspEmoLLM. Experimental results demonstrate that ConspEmoLLM-v2 retains or
exceeds the performance of ConspEmoLLM on the original human-authored content
in ConDID, and considerably outperforms both ConspEmoLLM and several other
baselines when applied to sentiment-transformed tweets in ConDID-v2. The
project will be available at https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM.

Abstract: This study introduces a framework for evaluating consistency in large
language model (LLM) binary text classification, addressing the lack of
established reliability assessment methods. Adapting psychometric principles,
we determine sample size requirements, develop metrics for invalid responses,
and evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability. Our case study examines
financial news sentiment classification across 14 LLMs (including
claude-3-7-sonnet, gpt-4o, deepseek-r1, gemma3, llama3.2, phi4, and
command-r-plus), with five replicates per model on 1,350 articles. Models
demonstrated high intra-rater consistency, achieving perfect agreement on
90-98% of examples, with minimal differences between expensive and economical
models from the same families. When validated against StockNewsAPI labels,
models achieved strong performance (accuracy 0.76-0.88), with smaller models
like gemma3:1B, llama3.2:3B, and claude-3-5-haiku outperforming larger
counterparts. All models performed at chance when predicting actual market
movements, indicating task constraints rather than model limitations. Our
framework provides systematic guidance for LLM selection, sample size planning,
and reliability assessment, enabling organizations to optimize resources for
classification tasks.

TLDR: 论文提出了TLDM基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在超长上下文（如小说）中的理解能力，发现现有模型在超过64k标记后表现不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在复杂长上下文（如小说）中的表现，超越传统的“大海捞针”方法。

Method: 基于小说分析，设计TLDM基准测试，测试模型对情节摘要、故事世界配置和叙事时间的理解。

Result: 测试的七种前沿大语言模型在超过64k标记后表现不稳定。

Conclusion: 语言模型开发者需关注复杂长上下文场景下的评估，TLDM基准测试为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Although the context length of large language models (LLMs) has increased to
millions of tokens, evaluating their effectiveness beyond needle-in-a-haystack
approaches has proven difficult. We argue that novels provide a case study of
subtle, complicated structure and long-range semantic dependencies often over
128k tokens in length. Inspired by work on computational novel analysis, we
release the Too Long, Didn't Model (TLDM) benchmark, which tests a model's
ability to report plot summary, storyworld configuration, and elapsed narrative
time. We find that none of seven tested frontier LLMs retain stable
understanding beyond 64k tokens. Our results suggest language model developers
must look beyond "lost in the middle" benchmarks when evaluating model
performance in complex long-context scenarios. To aid in further development we
release the TLDM benchmark together with reference code and data.

TLDR: MedBrowseComp是一个新的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型在临床实践中检索和整合多跳医学事实的能力，揭示了当前模型与临床需求之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中需要整合多样化的知识库，但现有评估方法未能充分测试模型的真实能力，因此需要更系统的基准测试。

Method: 开发了MedBrowseComp，包含1000多个人工设计的问题，模拟临床场景中需要整合碎片化或冲突信息的情况。

Result: 测试显示前沿代理系统的性能低至10%，表明当前模型能力与临床要求的严谨性存在显著差距。

Conclusion: MedBrowseComp为可靠的医学信息检索提供了明确的测试平台，并为未来模型升级设定了具体目标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as decision-support
tools in clinical practice, yet safe clinical reasoning demands integrating
heterogeneous knowledge bases -- trials, primary studies, regulatory documents,
and cost data -- under strict accuracy constraints. Existing evaluations often
rely on synthetic prompts, reduce the task to single-hop factoid queries, or
conflate reasoning with open-ended generation, leaving their real-world utility
unclear. To close this gap, we present MedBrowseComp, the first benchmark that
systematically tests an agent's ability to reliably retrieve and synthesize
multi-hop medical facts from live, domain-specific knowledge bases.
MedBrowseComp contains more than 1,000 human-curated questions that mirror
clinical scenarios where practitioners must reconcile fragmented or conflicting
information to reach an up-to-date conclusion. Applying MedBrowseComp to
frontier agentic systems reveals performance shortfalls as low as ten percent,
exposing a critical gap between current LLM capabilities and the rigor demanded
in clinical settings. MedBrowseComp therefore offers a clear testbed for
reliable medical information seeking and sets concrete goals for future model
and toolchain upgrades. You can visit our project page at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽在NLP领域有广泛应用，但存在强化社会偏见的问题，尤其是种姓偏见，目前研究不足。

Method: 提出DECASTE框架，从社会文化、经济、教育和政治四个维度评估种姓公平性，采用定制提示策略。

Result: 实验显示，主流大语言模型系统性强化种姓偏见，边缘种姓群体（如Dalits和Shudras）受到显著不公平对待。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs中种姓偏见的普遍性，强调需要更全面的偏见评估方法以减少实际应用中的风险。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing (NLP) and expanded their applications across
diverse domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have been
shown to reflect and perpetuate harmful societal biases, including those based
on ethnicity, gender, and religion. A critical and underexplored issue is the
reinforcement of caste-based biases, particularly towards India's marginalized
caste groups such as Dalits and Shudras. In this paper, we address this gap by
proposing DECASTE, a novel, multi-dimensional framework designed to detect and
assess both implicit and explicit caste biases in LLMs. Our approach evaluates
caste fairness across four dimensions: socio-cultural, economic, educational,
and political, using a range of customized prompting strategies. By
benchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal that these models
systematically reinforce caste biases, with significant disparities observed in
the treatment of oppressed versus dominant caste groups. For example, bias
scores are notably elevated when comparing Dalits and Shudras with dominant
caste groups, reflecting societal prejudices that persist in model outputs.
These results expose the subtle yet pervasive caste biases in LLMs and
emphasize the need for more comprehensive and inclusive bias evaluation
methodologies that assess the potential risks of deploying such models in
real-world contexts.

TLDR: 论文提出了CROSS基准，用于评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的文化安全推理能力，发现现有模型存在显著文化安全差距，并通过两种增强策略显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态安全基准主要关注物理安全，忽视了文化规范导致的象征性伤害，因此需要专门评估模型的文化安全能力。

Method: 提出CROSS基准，包含1,284个多语言视觉查询，基于跨文化理论框架CROSS-Eval评估21个领先LVLMs，并开发了监督微调和偏好调优两种增强策略。

Result: 最佳模型在文化意识和合规性上表现不佳（61.79%和37.73%），增强策略显著提升了GPT-4o的性能（文化意识+60.14%，合规性+55.2%）。

Conclusion: 文化安全是LVLMs的重要问题，现有模型仍需改进，增强策略有效但未完全解决问题。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in globally
distributed applications, such as tourism assistants, yet their ability to
produce culturally appropriate responses remains underexplored. Existing
multimodal safety benchmarks primarily focus on physical safety and overlook
violations rooted in cultural norms, which can result in symbolic harm. To
address this gap, we introduce CROSS, a benchmark designed to assess the
cultural safety reasoning capabilities of LVLMs. CROSS includes 1,284
multilingual visually grounded queries from 16 countries, three everyday
domains, and 14 languages, where cultural norm violations emerge only when
images are interpreted in context. We propose CROSS-Eval, an intercultural
theory-based framework that measures four key dimensions: cultural awareness,
norm education, compliance, and helpfulness. Using this framework, we evaluate
21 leading LVLMs, including mixture-of-experts models and reasoning models.
Results reveal significant cultural safety gaps: the best-performing model
achieves only 61.79% in awareness and 37.73% in compliance. While some
open-source models reach GPT-4o-level performance, they still fall notably
short of proprietary models. Our results further show that increasing reasoning
capacity improves cultural alignment but does not fully resolve the issue. To
improve model performance, we develop two enhancement strategies: supervised
fine-tuning with culturally grounded, open-ended data and preference tuning
with contrastive response pairs that highlight safe versus unsafe behaviors.
These methods substantially improve GPT-4o's cultural awareness (+60.14%) and
compliance (+55.2%), while preserving general multimodal capabilities with
minimal performance reduction on general multimodal understanding benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统密集检索模型计算成本高且适应性差，CRAFT旨在解决这些问题。

Result: CRAFT在检索性能上优于现有稀疏、密集和混合检索方法。

Conclusion: CRAFT通过优化检索流程和增强表格表示，显著提升了表格问答效果。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) involves retrieving relevant tables from a
large corpus to answer natural language queries. Traditional dense retrieval
models, such as DTR and ColBERT, not only incur high computational costs for
large-scale retrieval tasks but also require retraining or fine-tuning on new
datasets, limiting their adaptability to evolving domains and knowledge. In
this work, we propose $\textbf{CRAFT}$, a cascaded retrieval approach that
first uses a sparse retrieval model to filter a subset of candidate tables
before applying more computationally expensive dense models and neural
re-rankers. Our approach achieves better retrieval performance than
state-of-the-art (SOTA) sparse, dense, and hybrid retrievers. We further
enhance table representations by generating table descriptions and titles using
Gemini Flash 1.5. End-to-end TQA results using various Large Language Models
(LLMs) on NQ-Tables, a subset of the Natural Questions Dataset, demonstrate
$\textbf{CRAFT}$ effectiveness.

Method: 使用文化特定数据集，提出LSKExtractor方法，评估并利用语言特定知识。

Result: 实验显示，模型在某些语言中推理能力更强，平均准确率提升10%。

Conclusion: 研究支持开发更具文化包容性的语言模型。

Abstract: Code-switching is a common phenomenon of alternating between different
languages in the same utterance, thought, or conversation. We posit that humans
code-switch because they feel more comfortable talking about certain topics and
domains in one language than another. With the rise of knowledge-intensive
language models, we ask ourselves the next, natural question: Could models hold
more knowledge on some topics in some language X? More importantly, could we
improve reasoning by changing the language that reasoning is performed in? We
coin the term Language Specific Knowledge (LSK) to represent this phenomenon.
As ethnic cultures tend to develop alongside different languages, we employ
culture-specific datasets (that contain knowledge about cultural and social
behavioral norms). We find that language models can perform better when using
chain-of-thought reasoning in some languages other than English, sometimes even
better in low-resource languages. Paired with previous works showing that
semantic similarity does not equate to representational similarity, we
hypothesize that culturally specific texts occur more abundantly in
corresponding languages, enabling specific knowledge to occur only in specific
"expert" languages. Motivated by our initial results, we design a simple
methodology called LSKExtractor to benchmark the language-specific knowledge
present in a language model and, then, exploit it during inference. We show our
results on various models and datasets, showing an average relative improvement
of 10% in accuracy. Our research contributes to the open-source development of
language models that are inclusive and more aligned with the cultural and
linguistic contexts in which they are deployed.

Motivation: 在资源受限设备上部署计算密集型LLMs进行信息提取时，面临幻觉、上下文长度限制和高延迟等问题，尤其是在处理多样化提取模式时。

Method: DLISC采用双LoRA模块：Identification LoRA用于检索与查询最相关的模式，Extraction LoRA基于选定模式进行信息提取，并结合增量模式缓存减少冗余计算。

Result: 在多个信息提取数据集上的实验表明，DLISC在效果和效率上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: DLISC通过双LoRA和增量模式缓存，有效解决了资源受限设备上信息提取的挑战，提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Information extraction (IE) plays a crucial role in natural language
processing (NLP) by converting unstructured text into structured knowledge.
Deploying computationally intensive large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained devices for information extraction is challenging,
particularly due to issues like hallucinations, limited context length, and
high latency-especially when handling diverse extraction schemas. To address
these challenges, we propose a two-stage information extraction approach
adapted for on-device LLMs, called Dual-LoRA with Incremental Schema Caching
(DLISC), which enhances both schema identification and schema-aware extraction
in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, DLISC adopts an
Identification LoRA module for retrieving the most relevant schemas to a given
query, and an Extraction LoRA module for performing information extraction
based on the previously selected schemas. To accelerate extraction inference,
Incremental Schema Caching is incorporated to reduce redundant computation,
substantially improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple
information extraction datasets demonstrate notable improvements in both
effectiveness and efficiency.

Motivation: 当前多智能体系统（MAS）依赖手动设计的角色和通信协议，难以适应新任务或充分利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的优势。自动MAS方法通常需要验证集且缺乏动态适应性。

Method: SELF-MAS通过元级设计迭代生成、评估和优化MAS配置，支持动态智能体组合和问题分解，无需验证集。

Result: 在数学、研究生级QA和软件工程基准测试中，SELF-MAS平均准确率提升7.44%，优于手动和自动MAS基线。

Conclusion: SELF-MAS展示了元级自监督设计在创建高效、自适应MAS中的潜力。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) leveraging the impressive capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for tackling complex tasks.
However, most current MAS depend on manually designed agent roles and
communication protocols. These manual designs often fail to align with the
underlying LLMs' strengths and struggle to adapt to novel tasks. Recent
automatic MAS approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations but typically
necessitate a validation-set for tuning and yield static MAS designs lacking
adaptability during inference. We introduce SELF-MAS, the first
self-supervised, inference-time only framework for automatic MAS design.
SELF-MAS employs meta-level design to iteratively generate, evaluate, and
refine MAS configurations tailored to each problem instance, without requiring
a validation set. Critically, it enables dynamic agent composition and problem
decomposition through meta-feedback on solvability and completeness.
Experiments across math, graduate-level QA, and software engineering
benchmarks, using both closed-source and open-source LLM back-bones of varying
sizes, demonstrate that SELF-MAS outperforms both manual and automatic MAS
baselines, achieving a 7.44% average accuracy improvement over the next
strongest baseline while maintaining cost-efficiency. These findings underscore
the promise of meta-level self-supervised design for creating effective and
adaptive MAS.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）和多模态LLMs（MLLMs）在语音输入数学推理中的能力，填补现有研究在逻辑逐步推理任务上的空白。

Method: 提出Spoken-MQA基准，涵盖多种数学问题类型，包括算术、上下文推理和知识导向问题，通过实验评估语音模型的性能。

Result: 语音LLMs在上下文推理任务中表现较好，但在直接算术和口头数学表达上表现不佳，且数学知识推理能力显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前语音LLMs在数学推理任务中存在局限性，需进一步优化以提升对口头数学表达的处理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
have led to strong reasoning ability across a wide range of tasks. However,
their ability to perform mathematical reasoning from spoken input remains
underexplored. Prior studies on speech modality have mostly focused on factual
speech understanding or simple audio reasoning tasks, providing limited insight
into logical step-by-step reasoning, such as that required for mathematical
problem solving. To address this gap, we introduce Spoken Math Question
Answering (Spoken-MQA), a new benchmark designed to evaluate the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of speech-based models, including both cascade models
(ASR + LLMs) and end-to-end speech LLMs. Spoken-MQA covers a diverse set of
math problems, including pure arithmetic, single-step and multi-step contextual
reasoning, and knowledge-oriented reasoning problems, all presented in
unambiguous natural spoken language. Through extensive experiments, we find
that: (1) while some speech LLMs perform competitively on contextual reasoning
tasks involving basic arithmetic, they still struggle with direct arithmetic
problems; (2) current LLMs exhibit a strong bias toward symbolic mathematical
expressions written in LaTex and have difficulty interpreting verbalized
mathematical expressions; and (3) mathematical knowledge reasoning abilities
are significantly degraded in current speech LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs未直接训练于电子健康记录（EHR）数据，但在临床自然语言处理任务中表现良好，因此需要探究其学习机制。

Method: 通过两个关键视角分析：1）临床术语理解能力；2）对无支持医学声明的响应。使用新数据集MedLingo评估，并分析预训练语料库中相关信息的频率及其与模型输出的关系。

Result: 临床术语在预训练语料中的出现频率与模型性能相关，但实际临床笔记中的术语在语料中较少出现。模型可能重复无支持的医学声明。

Conclusion: 预训练语料与实际临床需求存在不匹配，需优化未来数据集构成以减少模型对无支持声明的依赖。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have performed well across various clinical
natural language processing tasks, despite not being directly trained on
electronic health record (EHR) data. In this work, we examine how popular
open-source LLMs learn clinical information from large mined corpora through
two crucial but understudied lenses: (1) their interpretation of clinical
jargon, a foundational ability for understanding real-world clinical notes, and
(2) their responses to unsupported medical claims. For both use cases, we
investigate the frequency of relevant clinical information in their
corresponding pretraining corpora, the relationship between pretraining data
composition and model outputs, and the sources underlying this data. To isolate
clinical jargon understanding, we evaluate LLMs on a new dataset MedLingo.
Unsurprisingly, we find that the frequency of clinical jargon mentions across
major pretraining corpora correlates with model performance. However, jargon
frequently appearing in clinical notes often rarely appears in pretraining
corpora, revealing a mismatch between available data and real-world usage.
Similarly, we find that a non-negligible portion of documents support disputed
claims that can then be parroted by models. Finally, we classified and analyzed
the types of online sources in which clinical jargon and unsupported medical
claims appear, with implications for future dataset composition.

We employ deep learning to detect hedge sentences and aspects, then analyze
report length, hedge word/sentence frequency, aspect mentions, and sentiment to
evaluate text-score alignment. Correlation, significance, and regression tests
examine confidence scores' impact on paper outcomes. Results show high
text-score consistency across all levels, with regression revealing higher
confidence scores correlate with paper rejection, validating expert assessments

Abstract: Linear Concept Vectors have proven effective for steering large language

difference-in-means derive these vectors from LLM hidden representations,
diverse data introduces noises (i.e., irrelevant features) that challenge
steering robustness. To address this, we propose Sparse Autoencoder-Denoised
Concept Vectors (SDCV), which uses Sparse Autoencoders to filter out noisy
features from hidden representations. When applied to linear probing and
difference-in-means, our method improves their steering success rates. We
validate our noise hypothesis through counterfactual experiments and feature

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM嵌入因预训练中的单向注意力机制与文本嵌入任务的双向性不匹配，限制了其性能。扩散语言模型因其双向架构和在推理任务中的成功表现，成为改进文本嵌入的潜在方案。

Method: 采用扩散语言模型构建文本嵌入模型，利用其双向注意力机制捕捉全局上下文。

Result: 扩散语言嵌入模型在长文档检索、推理密集型检索和指令跟随检索中分别比LLM嵌入模型提升20%、8%和2%，并在传统文本嵌入基准上表现竞争性。

Conclusion: 双向注意力机制对长文本和复杂文本的全局上下文编码至关重要，扩散语言模型为文本嵌入提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based embedding models, benefiting from large
scale pre-training and post-training, have begun to surpass BERT and T5-based
models on general-purpose text embedding tasks such as document retrieval.
However, a fundamental limitation of LLM embeddings lies in the unidirectional
attention used during autoregressive pre-training, which misaligns with the
bidirectional nature of text embedding tasks. To this end, We propose adopting
diffusion language models for text embeddings, motivated by their inherent
bidirectional architecture and recent success in matching or surpassing LLMs
especially on reasoning tasks. We present the first systematic study of the
diffusion language embedding model, which outperforms the LLM-based embedding
model by 20% on long-document retrieval, 8% on reasoning-intensive retrieval,
2% on instruction-following retrieval, and achieve competitive performance on
traditional text embedding benchmarks. Our analysis verifies that bidirectional
attention is crucial for encoding global context in long and complex text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在图表理解任务中需要大量高质量数据的问题，降低数据收集和训练成本。

Method: 提出ChartCards框架，系统合成图表信息（如数据表、可视化代码、视觉元素和多维语义标题），并构建MetaChart数据集。

Result: 在多种图表理解任务中，微调模型平均性能提升5%，其中文本到图表检索和图表到表格任务提升显著（17%和28%）。

Conclusion: ChartCards和MetaChart为多任务图表理解提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The emergence of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents new
opportunities for chart understanding. However, due to the fine-grained nature
of these tasks, applying MLLMs typically requires large, high-quality datasets
for task-specific fine-tuning, leading to high data collection and training
costs. To address this, we propose ChartCards, a unified chart-metadata
generation framework for multi-task chart understanding. ChartCards
systematically synthesizes various chart information, including data tables,
visualization code, visual elements, and multi-dimensional semantic captions.
By structuring this information into organized metadata, ChartCards enables a
single chart to support multiple downstream tasks, such as text-to-chart
retrieval, chart summarization, chart-to-table conversion, chart description,
and chart question answering. Using ChartCards, we further construct MetaChart,
a large-scale high-quality dataset containing 10,862 data tables, 85K charts,
and 170 K high-quality chart captions. We validate the dataset through
qualitative crowdsourcing evaluations and quantitative fine-tuning experiments
across various chart understanding tasks. Fine-tuning six different models on
MetaChart resulted in an average performance improvement of 5% across all
tasks. The most notable improvements are seen in text-to-chart retrieval and
chart-to-table tasks, with Long-CLIP and Llama 3.2-11B achieving improvements

claim, current approaches majorly follow one of two strategies i.e. (i) relying
on embedded knowledge of language models, and (ii) fine-tuning them with
evidence pieces. While the former can make systems to hallucinate, the later
have not been very successful till date. The primary reason behind this is that
fact verification is a complex process. Language models have to parse through
multiple pieces of evidence before making a prediction. Further, the evidence
pieces often contradict each other. This makes the reasoning process even more
complex. We proposed a simple yet effective approach where we relied on
entailment and the generative ability of language models to produce
''supporting'' and ''refuting'' justifications (for the truthfulness of a
claim). We trained language models based on these justifications and achieved
superior results. Apart from that, we did a systematic comparison of different
prompting and fine-tuning strategies, as it is currently lacking in the
literature. Some of our observations are: (i) training language models with raw
evidence sentences registered an improvement up to 8.20% in macro-F1, over the
best performing baseline for the RAW-FC dataset, (ii) similarly, training
language models with prompted claim-evidence understanding (TBE-2) registered
an improvement (with a margin up to 16.39%) over the baselines for the same
dataset, (iii) training language models with entailed justifications (TBE-3)
outperformed the baselines by a huge margin (up to 28.57% and 44.26% for
LIAR-RAW and RAW-FC, respectively). We have shared our code repository to
reproduce the results.

TLDR: MolLangBench是一个评估分子-语言界面任务的基准，包括识别、编辑和生成任务。当前AI模型在这些任务上表现有限，需进一步研究改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为化学家和AI系统提供精确的分子识别、编辑和生成能力，推动化学领域AI的发展。

Method: 通过自动化工具构建识别任务，专家标注和验证编辑与生成任务，支持多种分子表示形式。

Result: 最强模型在识别和编辑任务上准确率约79%，生成任务仅29%，显示当前AI系统的局限性。

Conclusion: MolLangBench揭示了AI在分子任务上的不足，希望促进更可靠化学AI系统的研究。

Abstract: Precise recognition, editing, and generation of molecules are essential
prerequisites for both chemists and AI systems tackling various chemical tasks.
We present MolLangBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
fundamental molecule-language interface tasks: language-prompted molecular
structure recognition, editing, and generation. To ensure high-quality,
unambiguous, and deterministic outputs, we construct the recognition tasks
using automated cheminformatics tools, and curate editing and generation tasks
through rigorous expert annotation and validation. MolLangBench supports the
evaluation of models that interface language with different molecular
representations, including linear strings, molecular images, and molecular
graphs. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal significant limitations:
the strongest model (o3) achieves $79.2\%$ and $78.5\%$ accuracy on recognition
and editing tasks, which are intuitively simple for humans, and performs even
worse on the generation task, reaching only $29.0\%$ accuracy. These results
highlight the shortcomings of current AI systems in handling even preliminary
molecular recognition and manipulation tasks. We hope MolLangBench will
catalyze further research toward more effective and reliable AI systems for
chemical applications.

TLDR: 论文提出PSN-IRT框架，用于更准确地评估大语言模型（LLMs）的能力，并揭示当前基准测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLMs时存在不一致性和区分度不足的问题，无法真实反映模型能力。

Method: 提出PSN-IRT框架，结合项目反应理论（IRT）和伪孪生网络，增强对项目特性和模型能力的估计。

Result: 分析显示当前基准测试存在显著缺陷，PSN-IRT能构建更小但更符合人类偏好的基准。

Conclusion: PSN-IRT为LLM评估提供了更可靠的方法，并揭示了改进基准测试的方向。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) via benchmarks is widespread,
yet inconsistencies between different leaderboards and poor separability among
top models raise concerns about their ability to accurately reflect authentic
model capabilities. This paper provides a critical analysis of benchmark
effectiveness, examining main-stream prominent LLM benchmarks using results
from diverse models. We first propose a new framework for accurate and reliable
estimations of item characteristics and model abilities. Specifically, we
propose Pseudo-Siamese Network for Item Response Theory (PSN-IRT), an enhanced
Item Response Theory framework that incorporates a rich set of item parameters
within an IRT-grounded architecture. Based on PSN-IRT, we conduct extensive
analysis which reveals significant and varied shortcomings in the measurement
quality of current benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that leveraging
PSN-IRT is able to construct smaller benchmarks while maintaining stronger
alignment with human preference.

TLDR: Self-GIVE通过强化学习增强LLMs的自动关联思考能力，解决了GIVE在效率、通用性和准确性上的限制，显著提升了小规模LLMs在生物医学QA任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GIVE在知识外推中的效率、通用性和准确性限制，提升LLMs在科学问题中的关联思考能力。

Method: 提出Self-GIVE框架，结合检索和强化学习，自动提取结构化信息和实体集，减少LLM调用和令牌开销。

Result: 在生物医学QA任务中，Qwen2.5 3B和7B模型的性能分别提升至71.4%和90.5%，令牌使用减少90%。

Conclusion: Self-GIVE有效提升了小规模LLMs的性能，实现了结构化检索与关联推理的可扩展集成。

Abstract: When addressing complex questions that require new information, people often
associate the question with existing knowledge to derive a sensible answer. For
instance, when evaluating whether melatonin aids insomnia, one might associate
"hormones helping mental disorders" with "melatonin being a hormone and
insomnia a mental disorder" to complete the reasoning. Large Language Models
(LLMs) also require such associative thinking, particularly in resolving
scientific inquiries when retrieved knowledge is insufficient and does not
directly answer the question. Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE)
addresses this by using a knowledge graph (KG) to extrapolate structured
knowledge. However, it involves the construction and pruning of many
hypothetical triplets, which limits efficiency and generalizability. We propose
Self-GIVE, a retrieve-RL framework that enhances LLMs with automatic
associative thinking through reinforcement learning. Self-GIVE extracts
structured information and entity sets to assist the model in linking to the
queried concepts. We address GIVE's key limitations: (1) extensive LLM calls
and token overhead for knowledge extrapolation, (2) difficulty in deploying on
smaller LLMs (3B or 7B) due to complex instructions, and (3) inaccurate
knowledge from LLM pruning. Specifically, after fine-tuning using self-GIVE
with a 135 node UMLS KG, it improves the performance of the Qwen2.5 3B and 7B
models by up to $\textbf{28.5%$\rightarrow$71.4%}$ and
$\textbf{78.6$\rightarrow$90.5%}$ in samples $\textbf{unseen}$ in challenging
biomedical QA tasks. In particular, Self-GIVE allows the 7B model to match or
outperform GPT3.5 turbo with GIVE, while cutting token usage by over 90\%.
Self-GIVE enhances the scalable integration of structured retrieval and
reasoning with associative thinking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查工具主要针对英语，忽视了乌尔都语等低资源语言的需求，导致全球2亿多乌尔都语使用者缺乏可靠的事实核查工具。

Method: 提出动态多策略证据检索管道，结合单语和翻译方法，并发布两个新标注基准数据集（UrduFactBench和UrduFactQA）。

Result: 实验表明UrduFactCheck（尤其是翻译增强版本）在多项指标上优于基线方法和开源替代方案，同时评估了12种SOTA LLM在乌尔都语事实问答中的表现。

Conclusion: UrduFactCheck填补了乌尔都语事实核查的空白，开源代码和数据集为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: The rapid use of large language models (LLMs) has raised critical concerns
regarding the factual reliability of their outputs, especially in low-resource
languages such as Urdu. Existing automated fact-checking solutions
overwhelmingly focus on English, leaving a significant gap for the 200+ million
Urdu speakers worldwide. In this work, we introduce UrduFactCheck, the first
comprehensive, modular fact-checking framework specifically tailored for Urdu.
Our system features a dynamic, multi-strategy evidence retrieval pipeline that
combines monolingual and translation-based approaches to address the scarcity
of high-quality Urdu evidence. We curate and release two new hand-annotated
benchmarks: UrduFactBench for claim verification and UrduFactQA for evaluating
LLM factuality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UrduFactCheck,
particularly its translation-augmented variants, consistently outperforms
baselines and open-source alternatives on multiple metrics. We further
benchmark twelve state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on factual question answering in
Urdu, highlighting persistent gaps between proprietary and open-source models.

Motivation: 探索小型语言模型在创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）共情对话中的潜力，为资源高效且安全的AI辅助心理健康护理提供基础。

Method: 引入TIDE数据集，包含10,000个两轮对话，基于三因素共情模型，通过临床心理学家审核。评估8个小型模型在微调前后的表现，并与前沿模型对比。

Result: 微调提升了共情感知，但效果因场景和用户而异，小型模型存在共情天花板。不同用户群体对回复的偏好不同。

Conclusion: 研究为开发安全、高效的共情AI提供了基础，强调自动指标的局限性和用户感知的重要性。

Abstract: Can small language models with 0.5B to 5B parameters meaningfully engage in
trauma-informed, empathetic dialogue for individuals with PTSD? We address this
question by introducing TIDE, a dataset of 10,000 two-turn dialogues spanning
500 diverse PTSD client personas and grounded in a three-factor empathy model:
emotion recognition, distress normalization, and supportive reflection. All
scenarios and reference responses were reviewed for realism and trauma
sensitivity by a clinical psychologist specializing in PTSD. We evaluate eight
small language models before and after fine-tuning, comparing their outputs to
a frontier model (Claude Sonnet 3.5). Our IRB-approved human evaluation and
automatic metrics show that fine-tuning generally improves perceived empathy,
but gains are highly scenario- and user-dependent, with smaller models facing
an empathy ceiling. Demographic analysis shows older adults value distress
validation and graduate-educated users prefer nuanced replies, while gender
effects are minimal. We highlight the limitations of automatic metrics and the
need for context- and user-aware system design. Our findings, along with the
planned release of TIDE, provide a foundation for building safe,
resource-efficient, and ethically sound empathetic AI to supplement, not
replace, clinical mental health care.

Motivation: 低资源语言在神经机器翻译中面临数据不足和模型泛化能力差的问题，尤其在领域适应任务中，选择最优模型至关重要。

Method: 采用多种基于多臂老虎机的算法（如UCB、Linear UCB、Neural Linear Bandit和Thompson Sampling）进行模型选择。

Result: 在三种非洲语言和不同领域的实验中，该方法在目标数据可用或不可用的情况下均表现出鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 基于多臂老虎机的模型选择方法能有效解决低资源语言翻译中的资源限制问题，提升翻译性能。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems face significant challenges when
working with low-resource languages, particularly in domain adaptation tasks.
These difficulties arise due to limited training data and suboptimal model
generalization, As a result, selecting an optimal model for translation is
crucial for achieving strong performance on in-domain data, particularly in
scenarios where fine-tuning is not feasible or practical. In this paper, we
investigate strategies for selecting the most suitable NMT model for a given
domain using bandit-based algorithms, including Upper Confidence Bound, Linear
UCB, Neural Linear Bandit, and Thompson Sampling. Our method effectively
addresses the resource constraints by facilitating optimal model selection with
high confidence. We evaluate the approach across three African languages and
domains, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in both scenarios where
target data is available and where it is absent.

Motivation: 中文社交媒体中的大量UGC为研究网络流行语提供了可能，但LLMs是否能基于UGC生成准确定义尚待探索。

Method: 提出了RESS方法，通过引导LLMs的理解过程生成更准确的定义，并创建了CHEER数据集进行基准测试。

Result: RESS方法表现优于现有方法，但也揭示了LLMs的共性问题：过度依赖先验知识、推理能力不足和难以识别高质量UGC。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM生成定义奠定了基础，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: The massive user-generated content (UGC) available in Chinese social media is
giving rise to the possibility of studying internet buzzwords. In this paper,
we study if large language models (LLMs) can generate accurate definitions for
these buzzwords based on UGC as examples. Our work serves a threefold
contribution. First, we introduce CHEER, the first dataset of Chinese internet
buzzwords, each annotated with a definition and relevant UGC. Second, we
propose a novel method, called RESS, to effectively steer the comprehending
process of LLMs to produce more accurate buzzword definitions, mirroring the
skills of human language learning. Third, with CHEER, we benchmark the
strengths and weaknesses of various off-the-shelf definition generation methods
and our RESS. Our benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of RESS while
revealing crucial shared challenges: over-reliance on prior exposure,
underdeveloped inferential abilities, and difficulty identifying high-quality
UGC to facilitate comprehension. We believe our work lays the groundwork for
future advancements in LLM-based definition generation. Our dataset and code
are available at https://github.com/SCUNLP/Buzzword.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在多域不平衡数据中表现不佳，倾向于优化主导域，忽视弱势域，导致泛化和公平性问题。

Method: 提出DISCO，结合域感知奖励缩放和难度感知奖励缩放，优化策略学习。

Result: DISCO在Qwen3模型上比现有GRPO变体提升5%，在多域对齐基准上达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: DISCO通过域和难度感知的奖励缩放，显著提升了多域不平衡数据中的策略学习效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences
through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods,
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its
simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned
value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution
and uniform semantic alignment across groups - assumptions that rarely hold in
real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO
disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented
ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose
Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled
extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key
innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by
reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward
scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize
uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies
promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that
DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on
Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment
benchmarks.

Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在现实应用中表现优异，但其在跨语言和文化知识整合中的一致性仍存在问题，需进一步评估和改进。

Method: 通过KnowRecall（15种语言的视觉问答）和VisRecall（9种语言的视觉记忆描述）两个基准测试MLLMs的跨语言一致性。

Result: 实验表明，即使是先进的MLLMs在跨语言一致性上仍有困难。

Conclusion: 需开发更鲁棒的方法，以构建真正多语言且具备文化意识的模型。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving
consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural
knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we
introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate
cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering
benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages,
focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall
assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark
appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results
reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle
to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust
approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问题回答（MHQA）需要整合多源信息，但人工标注成本高且现有合成方法效果有限。

Result: 合成问题质量与人工标注数据集相当或更好，成本更低。

Conclusion: HopWeaver为资源稀缺领域的高质量MHQA数据集开发提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) is crucial for evaluating the model's
capability to integrate information from diverse sources. However, creating
extensive and high-quality MHQA datasets is challenging: (i) manual annotation
is expensive, and (ii) current synthesis methods often produce simplistic
questions or require extensive manual guidance. This paper introduces
HopWeaver, the first automatic framework synthesizing authentic multi-hop
questions from unstructured text corpora without human intervention. HopWeaver
synthesizes two types of multi-hop questions (bridge and comparison) using an
innovative approach that identifies complementary documents across corpora. Its
coherent pipeline constructs authentic reasoning paths that integrate
information across multiple documents, ensuring synthesized questions
necessitate authentic multi-hop reasoning. We further present a comprehensive
system for evaluating synthesized multi-hop questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that the synthesized questions achieve comparable or superior
quality to human-annotated datasets at a lower cost. Our approach is valuable
for developing MHQA datasets in specialized domains with scarce annotated
resources. The code for HopWeaver is publicly available.

Result: 在极低资源语言的情感分类和自然语言推理任务上，DeFT-X表现优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: DeFT-X通过去噪和稀疏微调的结合，显著提升了跨语言迁移的效果。

Abstract: Effective cross-lingual transfer remains a critical challenge in scaling the
benefits of large language models from high-resource to low-resource languages.
Towards this goal, prior studies have explored many approaches to combine task
knowledge from task-specific data in a (high-resource) source language and
language knowledge from unlabeled text in a (low-resource) target language. One
notable approach proposed composable sparse fine-tuning (SFT) for cross-lingual
transfer that learns task-specific and language-specific sparse masks to select
a subset of the pretrained model's parameters that are further fine-tuned.
These sparse fine-tuned vectors (SFTs) are subsequently composed with the
pretrained model to facilitate zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to a task in a
target language, using only task-specific data from a source language. These
sparse masks for SFTs were identified using a simple magnitude-based pruning.
In our work, we introduce DeFT-X, a novel composable SFT approach that denoises
the weight matrices of a pretrained model before magnitude pruning using
singular value decomposition, thus yielding more robust SFTs. We evaluate
DeFT-X on a diverse set of extremely low-resource languages for sentiment
classification (NusaX) and natural language inference (AmericasNLI) and
demonstrate that it performs at par or outperforms SFT and other prominent
cross-lingual transfer baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in contextual
understanding and reasoning. However, evaluating their performance across
diverse scientific domains remains underexplored, as existing benchmarks
primarily focus on general domains and fail to capture the intricate complexity
of scientific data. To bridge this gap, we construct SciCUEval, a comprehensive
benchmark dataset tailored to assess the scientific context understanding
capability of LLMs. It comprises ten domain-specific sub-datasets spanning
biology, chemistry, physics, biomedicine, and materials science, integrating
diverse data modalities including structured tables, knowledge graphs, and
unstructured texts. SciCUEval systematically evaluates four core competencies:
Relevant information identification, Information-absence detection,
Multi-source information integration, and Context-aware inference, through a
variety of question formats. We conduct extensive evaluations of
state-of-the-art LLMs on SciCUEval, providing a fine-grained analysis of their
strengths and limitations in scientific context understanding, and offering
valuable insights for the future development of scientific-domain LLMs.

Motivation: 解决讽刺检测中因地域文化差异导致的隐含情感识别困难问题。

Method: 采用PMP技术，结合人工标注的讽刺解释，对比FLUTE数据集，评估GEMMA和LLAMA模型的性能。

Result: PMP在所有任务和数据集上显著优于其他提示策略，且外部知识检索可缓解上下文相关错误。

Conclusion: PMP能有效生成多英语变体的讽刺解释，提升讽刺检测的可解释性和性能。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a challenge to sentiment analysis because of the incongruity
between stated and implied sentiment. The challenge is exacerbated when the
implication may be relevant to a specific country or geographical region.
Pragmatic metacognitive prompting (PMP) is a cognition-inspired technique that
has been used for pragmatic reasoning. In this paper, we harness PMP for
explainable sarcasm detection for Australian and Indian English, alongside a
benchmark dataset for standard English. We manually add sarcasm explanations to
an existing sarcasm-labeled dataset for Australian and Indian English called
BESSTIE, and compare the performance for explainable sarcasm detection for them
with FLUTE, a standard English dataset containing sarcasm explanations. Our
approach utilising PMP when evaluated on two open-weight LLMs (GEMMA and LLAMA)
achieves statistically significant performance improvement across all tasks and
datasets when compared with four alternative prompting strategies. We also find
that alternative techniques such as agentic prompting mitigate context-related
failures by enabling external knowledge retrieval. The focused contribution of
our work is utilising PMP in generating sarcasm explanations for varieties of
English.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SSMs在语言建模中的性能差异，尤其是其在关联召回任务中的表现，以揭示不同架构的机制差异。

Method: 在关联召回（AR）任务上测试不同模型（Transformers、Based SSM、Mamba、H3、Hyena），并通过因果干预分析其机制。随后引入新任务ATR（基于PCFG归纳）验证结果。

Result: Transformers和Based SSM能成功完成AR任务，因其能在上下文中存储键值关联；其他SSMs仅在最后状态计算关联，只有Mamba因短卷积组件部分成功。ATR任务中结果一致。

Conclusion: 不同架构即使性能相近，机制仍存在显著差异，需采用机制性评估方法。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) for language modelling promise an efficient and
performant alternative to quadratic-attention Transformers, yet show variable
performance on recalling basic information from the context. While performance
on synthetic tasks like Associative Recall (AR) can point to this deficiency,
behavioural metrics provide little information as to why--on a mechanistic
level--certain architectures fail and others succeed. To address this, we
conduct experiments on AR and find that only Transformers and Based SSM models
fully succeed at AR, with Mamba a close third, whereas the other SSMs (H3,
Hyena) fail. We then use causal interventions to explain why. We find that
Transformers and Based learn to store key-value associations in-context using
induction heads. By contrast, the SSMs compute these associations only at the
last state, with only Mamba succeeding because of its short convolution
component. To extend and deepen these findings, we introduce Associative
Treecall (ATR), a synthetic task similar to AR based on PCFG induction. ATR
introduces language-like hierarchical structure into the AR setting. We find
that all architectures learn the same mechanism as they did for AR, and the
same three models succeed at the task. These results reveal that architectures
with similar accuracy may still have substantive differences, motivating the
adoption of mechanistic evaluations.

Abstract: Efficient multi-hop reasoning requires Large Language Models (LLMs) based
agents to acquire high-value external knowledge iteratively. Previous work has
explored reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to perform search-based
document retrieval, achieving notable improvements in QA performance, but
underperform on complex, multi-hop QA resulting from the sparse rewards from
global signal only. To address this gap in existing research, we introduce
StepSearch, a framework for search LLMs that trained with step-wise proximal
policy optimization method. It consists of richer and more detailed
intermediate search rewards and token-level process supervision based on
information gain and redundancy penalties to better guide each search step. We
constructed a fine-grained question-answering dataset containing
sub-question-level search trajectories based on open source datasets through a
set of data pipeline method. On standard multi-hop QA benchmarks, it
significantly outperforms global-reward baselines, achieving 11.2% and 4.2%
absolute improvements for 3B and 7B models over various search with RL
baselines using only 19k training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision in optimizing deep search LLMs. Our
implementation is publicly available at

*Ian Steenstra,Timothy W. Bickmore*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种针对AI心理治疗师的新型风险分类法，旨在系统评估其潜在危害，填补现有评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型和智能虚拟代理作为心理治疗师的普及带来了心理健康服务的扩展机会，但也伴随着用户伤害和自杀等严重风险，现有评估方法无法捕捉治疗交互中的细微风险。

Method: 通过文献综述、专家访谈，并结合临床标准（如DSM-5）和现有评估工具（如NEQ、UE-ATR），开发了一种风险分类法。

Result: 该分类法为识别和评估用户/患者危害提供了结构化方法，并通过两个用例展示了其实际应用。

Conclusion: 该分类法是实现AI驱动心理健康支持更安全、更负责任创新的重要一步。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Intelligent Virtual
Agents acting as psychotherapists presents significant opportunities for
expanding mental healthcare access. However, their deployment has also been
linked to serious adverse outcomes, including user harm and suicide,
facilitated by a lack of standardized evaluation methodologies capable of
capturing the nuanced risks of therapeutic interaction. Current evaluation
techniques lack the sensitivity to detect subtle changes in patient cognition
and behavior during therapy sessions that may lead to subsequent
decompensation. We introduce a novel risk taxonomy specifically designed for
the systematic evaluation of conversational AI psychotherapists. Developed
through an iterative process including review of the psychotherapy risk
literature, qualitative interviews with clinical and legal experts, and
alignment with established clinical criteria (e.g., DSM-5) and existing
assessment tools (e.g., NEQ, UE-ATR), the taxonomy aims to provide a structured
approach to identifying and assessing user/patient harms. We provide a
high-level overview of this taxonomy, detailing its grounding, and discuss
potential use cases. We discuss two use cases in detail: monitoring cognitive
model-based risk factors during a counseling conversation to detect unsafe
deviations, in both human-AI counseling sessions and in automated benchmarking
of AI psychotherapists with simulated patients. The proposed taxonomy offers a
foundational step towards establishing safer and more responsible innovation in
the domain of AI-driven mental health support.

TLDR: 论文提出Row-of-Thought (RoT)方法，通过行级遍历表格实现高效推理，减少幻觉问题，无需训练，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Long CoT在表格推理中的高训练成本和低可靠性问题。

Method: 采用行级遍历表格的方式，结合LLMs的反思能力，实现推理扩展和优化。

Result: RoT在WikiTableQuestions和TableBench上表现优异，平均提升4.3%，且推理效率更高。

Conclusion: RoT是一种高效、可靠的表格推理方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: The table reasoning task, crucial for efficient data acquisition, aims to
answer questions based on the given table. Recently, reasoning large language
models (RLLMs) with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) significantly enhance
reasoning capabilities, leading to brilliant performance on table reasoning.
However, Long CoT suffers from high cost for training and exhibits low
reliability due to table content hallucinations. Therefore, we propose
Row-of-Thought (RoT), which performs iteratively row-wise table traversal,
allowing for reasoning extension and reflection-based refinement at each
traversal. Scaling reasoning length by row-wise traversal and leveraging
reflection capabilities of LLMs, RoT is training-free. The sequential traversal
encourages greater attention to the table, thus reducing hallucinations.
Experiments show that RoT, using non-reasoning models, outperforms RLLMs by an
average of 4.3%, and achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiTableQuestions
and TableBench with comparable models, proving its effectiveness. Also, RoT
outperforms Long CoT with fewer reasoning tokens, indicating higher efficiency.

Result: 发现格式化奖励有效提升性能，LLM规模和初始化对结果影响显著，搜索引擎选择对训练动态和推理稳健性至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究为实际应用中构建和部署基于LLM的搜索代理提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated strong potential in training
large language models (LLMs) capable of complex reasoning for real-world
problem solving. More recently, RL has been leveraged to create sophisticated
LLM-based search agents that adeptly combine reasoning with search engine use.
While the use of RL for training search agents is promising, the optimal design
of such agents remains not fully understood. In particular, key factors -- such
as (1) reward formulation, (2) the choice and characteristics of the underlying
LLM, and (3) the role of the search engine in the RL process -- require further
investigation. In this work, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to
systematically investigate these and offer actionable insights. We highlight
several key findings: format rewards are effective in improving final
performance, whereas intermediate retrieval rewards have limited impact; the
scale and initialization of the LLM (general-purpose vs. reasoning-specialized)
significantly influence RL outcomes; and the choice of search engine plays a
critical role in shaping RL training dynamics and the robustness of the trained
agent during inference. These establish important guidelines for successfully
building and deploying LLM-based search agents in real-world applications. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖链式推理（CoT），导致性能下降和效率降低，尤其是在简单任务上。

Method: CAR首先生成简短答案并评估其困惑度，仅在低置信度（高困惑度）时触发长推理。

Result: 实验表明，CAR在多模态VQA/KIE基准和文本推理数据集上优于简短答案和长推理方法。

Conclusion: CAR在准确性和效率之间取得了最佳平衡。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning have significantly enhanced the capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
across diverse tasks. However, excessive reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning can impair model performance and brings unnecessarily lengthened
outputs, reducing efficiency. Our work reveals that prolonged reasoning does
not universally improve accuracy and even degrade performance on simpler tasks.
To address this, we propose Certainty-based Adaptive Reasoning (CAR), a novel
framework that dynamically switches between short answers and long-form
reasoning based on the model perplexity. CAR first generates a short answer and
evaluates its perplexity, triggering reasoning only when the model exhibits low
confidence (i.e., high perplexity). Experiments across diverse multimodal
VQA/KIE benchmarks and text reasoning datasets show that CAR outperforms both
short-answer and long-form reasoning approaches, striking an optimal balance
between accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReAct框架在复杂环境中容易产生不连贯的推理步骤，导致代理状态与目标不一致。ReflAct旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ReflAct通过持续反思代理状态与目标的匹配，显式地将决策基于状态并强制目标对齐，从而改进推理可靠性。

Result: ReflAct在ALFWorld中平均比ReAct提升27.7%，成功率高达93.3%，且优于增强版的ReAct。

Conclusion: 强化核心推理框架是提升代理性能的关键，ReflAct通过持续反思显著提升了推理可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM agents have largely built on reasoning backbones like
ReAct, which interleave thought and action in complex environments. However,
ReAct often produces ungrounded or incoherent reasoning steps, leading to
misalignment between the agent's actual state and goal. Our analysis finds that
this stems from ReAct's inability to maintain consistent internal beliefs and
goal alignment, causing compounding errors and hallucinations. To address this,
we introduce ReflAct, a novel backbone that shifts reasoning from merely
planning next actions to continuously reflecting on the agent's state relative
to its goal. By explicitly grounding decisions in states and enforcing ongoing
goal alignment, ReflAct dramatically improves strategic reliability. This
design delivers substantial empirical gains: ReflAct surpasses ReAct by 27.7%
on average, achieving a 93.3% success rate in ALFWorld. Notably, ReflAct even
outperforms ReAct with added enhancement modules (e.g., Reflexion, WKM),
showing that strengthening the core reasoning backbone is key to reliable agent
performance.

Method: 论文将EcomScript任务定义为三个子任务，提出了一种基于语义相似性的框架，将产品与脚本步骤关联，并构建了大规模数据集EcomScriptBench。

Result: 实验显示，现有LLM在EcomScript任务上表现不佳，但通过注入产品购买意图可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出的框架和数据集为电子商务脚本规划提供了新方向，未来可进一步优化LLM在此任务上的表现。

Abstract: Goal-oriented script planning, or the ability to devise coherent sequences of
actions toward specific goals, is commonly employed by humans to plan for
typical activities. In e-commerce, customers increasingly seek LLM-based
assistants to generate scripts and recommend products at each step, thereby
facilitating convenient and efficient shopping experiences. However, this
capability remains underexplored due to several challenges, including the
inability of LLMs to simultaneously conduct script planning and product
retrieval, difficulties in matching products caused by semantic discrepancies
between planned actions and search queries, and a lack of methods and benchmark
data for evaluation. In this paper, we step forward by formally defining the
task of E-commerce Script Planning (EcomScript) as three sequential subtasks.
We propose a novel framework that enables the scalable generation of
product-enriched scripts by associating products with each step based on the
semantic similarity between the actions and their purchase intentions. By
applying our framework to real-world e-commerce data, we construct the very
first large-scale EcomScript dataset, EcomScriptBench, which includes 605,229
scripts sourced from 2.4 million products. Human annotations are then conducted
to provide gold labels for a sampled subset, forming an evaluation benchmark.
Extensive experiments reveal that current (L)LMs face significant challenges
with EcomScript tasks, even after fine-tuning, while injecting product purchase
intentions improves their performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有评估方法假设遗忘集和保留集完全分离的局限性，更贴近实际应用需求。

Method: 通过构建描述相同事实但风格不同的文档集，评估选择性遗忘独特内容的能力。

Result: 现有方法能移除表层文本，但难以在不损害共享内容的情况下删除深层知识。

Conclusion: DUSK为开发更精确的遗忘技术提供了公共基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, raising concerns about the unauthorized use of copyrighted or
sensitive data. Machine unlearning aims to remove such 'forget' data while
preserving utility and information from the 'retain' set. However, existing
evaluations typically assume that forget and retain sets are fully disjoint,
overlooking realistic scenarios where they share overlapping content. For
instance, a news article may need to be unlearned, even though the same event,
such as an earthquake in Japan, is also described factually on Wikipedia.
Effective unlearning should remove the specific phrasing of the news article
while preserving publicly supported facts. In this paper, we introduce DUSK, a
benchmark designed to evaluate unlearning methods under realistic data overlap.
DUSK constructs document sets that describe the same factual content in
different styles, with some shared information appearing across all sets and
other content remaining unique to each. When one set is designated for
unlearning, an ideal method should remove its unique content while preserving
shared facts. We define seven evaluation metrics to assess whether unlearning
methods can achieve this selective removal. Our evaluation of nine recent
unlearning methods reveals a key limitation: while most can remove
surface-level text, they often fail to erase deeper, context-specific knowledge
without damaging shared content. We release DUSK as a public benchmark to
support the development of more precise and reliable unlearning techniques for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用知识图谱的结构信息和约束条件，导致大语言模型在知识不足或过时时产生幻觉。DP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DP采用渐进式知识蒸馏策略，结合监督微调和Kahneman-Tversky优化，将结构先验融入大语言模型；并通过推理-自省策略，基于约束先验进行精细化验证。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，DP实现了新的最优性能，尤其在ComplexWebQuestions数据集上Hit@1提升了13%，并生成了高可信度的响应。

Conclusion: DP框架通过充分利用知识图谱的先验知识，显著提升了大语言模型的推理和响应可靠性，具有灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation seeks to mitigate
hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) caused by insufficient or
outdated knowledge. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the
prior knowledge embedded in knowledge graphs (KGs), particularly their
structural information and explicit or implicit constraints. The former can
enhance the faithfulness of LLMs' reasoning, while the latter can improve the
reliability of response generation. Motivated by these, we propose a
trustworthy reasoning framework, termed Deliberation over Priors (DP), which
sufficiently utilizes the priors contained in KGs. Specifically, DP adopts a
progressive knowledge distillation strategy that integrates structural priors
into LLMs through a combination of supervised fine-tuning and Kahneman-Tversky
optimization, thereby improving the faithfulness of relation path generation.
Furthermore, our framework employs a reasoning-introspection strategy, which
guides LLMs to perform refined reasoning verification based on extracted
constraint priors, ensuring the reliability of response generation. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DP achieves new
state-of-the-art performance, especially a Hit@1 improvement of 13% on the
ComplexWebQuestions dataset, and generates highly trustworthy responses. We
also conduct various analyses to verify its flexibility and practicality. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法仅关注最终答案，忽略了推理链中可能泄露的私有或版权信息，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 通过R-TOFU基准，结合梯度优化和偏好优化方法，提出Reasoned IDK以平衡遗忘效果和模型效用。

Result: 研究发现传统方法在推理链中仍残留知识，且解码方式可能暴露已遗忘内容。

Conclusion: R-TOFU为LRMs的遗忘研究提供了系统基础，强调了多步推理评估的重要性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) embed private or copyrighted information not
only in their final answers but also throughout multi-step chain-of-thought
(CoT) traces, making reliable unlearning far more demanding than in standard
LLMs. We introduce Reasoning-TOFU (R-TOFU), the first benchmark tailored to
this setting. R-TOFU augments existing unlearning tasks with realistic CoT
annotations and provides step-wise metrics that expose residual knowledge
invisible to answer-level checks. Using R-TOFU, we carry out a comprehensive
comparison of gradient-based and preference-optimization baselines and show
that conventional answer-only objectives leave substantial forget traces in
reasoning. We further propose Reasoned IDK, a preference-optimization variant
that preserves coherent yet inconclusive reasoning, achieving a stronger
balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility than earlier refusal
styles. Finally, we identify a failure mode: decoding variants such as
ZeroThink and LessThink can still reveal forgotten content despite seemingly
successful unlearning, emphasizing the need to evaluate models under diverse
decoding settings. Together, the benchmark, analysis, and new baseline
establish a systematic foundation for studying and improving unlearning in LRMs
while preserving their reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 解决LLM生成内容缺乏文化多样性的问题。

Result: 多语言提示在多个模型上表现优于现有技术，减少文化特定信息的幻觉。

Conclusion: 多语言提示有效提升LLM的文化多样性表现，效果受语言资源水平和模型大小影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to lack cultural representation and
overall diversity in their generations, from expressing opinions to answering
factual questions. To mitigate this problem, we propose multilingual prompting:
a prompting method which generates several variations of a base prompt with
added cultural and linguistic cues from several cultures, generates responses,
and then combines the results. Building on evidence that LLMs have
language-specific knowledge, multilingual prompting seeks to increase diversity
by activating a broader range of cultural knowledge embedded in model training
data. Through experiments across multiple models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA
70B, and LLaMA 8B), we show that multilingual prompting consistently
outperforms existing diversity-enhancing techniques such as high-temperature
sampling, step-by-step recall, and personas prompting. Further analyses show
that the benefits of multilingual prompting vary with language resource level
and model size, and that aligning the prompting language with the cultural cues
reduces hallucination about culturally-specific information.

Conclusion: GETER为可解释时间推理提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show great potential in temporal
reasoning, most existing work focuses heavily on enhancing performance, often
neglecting the explainable reasoning processes underlying the results. To
address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering a wide range
of temporal granularities, designed to systematically evaluate LLMs'
capabilities in explainable temporal reasoning. Furthermore, our findings
reveal that LLMs struggle to deliver convincing explanations when relying
solely on textual information. To address challenge, we propose GETER, a novel
structure-aware generative framework that integrates Graph structures with text
for Explainable TEmporal Reasoning. Specifically, we first leverage temporal
knowledge graphs to develop a temporal encoder that captures structural
information for the query. Subsequently, we introduce a structure-text prefix
adapter to map graph structure features into the text embedding space. Finally,
LLMs generate explanation text by seamlessly integrating the soft graph token
with instruction-tuning prompt tokens. Experimental results indicate that GETER
achieves state-of-the-art performance while also demonstrating its
effectiveness as well as strong generalization capabilities. Our dataset and
code are available at https://github.com/carryTatum/GETER.

Conclusion: 当前LVLM评估系统存在漏洞，亟需更鲁棒的评估方法。

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have emerged as the preferred
tools for judging text-image alignment, yet their robustness along the visual
modality remains underexplored. This work is the first study to address a key
research question: Can adversarial visual manipulations systematically fool
LVLM judges into assigning unfairly inflated scores? We define potential image
induced biases within the context of T2I evaluation and examine how these
biases affect the evaluations of LVLM judges. Moreover, we introduce a novel,
fine-grained, multi-domain meta-evaluation benchmark named FRAME, which is
deliberately constructed to exhibit diverse score distributions. By introducing
the defined biases into the benchmark, we reveal that all tested LVLM judges
exhibit vulnerability across all domains, consistently inflating scores for
manipulated images. Further analysis reveals that combining multiple biases
amplifies their effects, and pairwise evaluations are similarly susceptible.
Moreover, we observe that visual biases persist under prompt-based mitigation
strategies, highlighting the vulnerability of current LVLM evaluation systems
and underscoring the urgent need for more robust LVLM judges.

Conclusion: MentalMAC有效提升LLMs检测心理操纵的能力，并发布了相关资源。

Abstract: Mental manipulation is a subtle yet pervasive form of psychological abuse
that poses serious threats to mental health. Its covert nature and the
complexity of manipulation strategies make it challenging to detect, even for
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). This concealment also hinders
the manual collection of large-scale, high-quality annotations essential for
training effective models. Although recent efforts have sought to improve LLM's
performance on this task, progress remains limited due to the scarcity of
real-world annotated datasets. To address these challenges, we propose
MentalMAC, a multi-task anti-curriculum distillation method that enhances LLMs'
ability to detect mental manipulation in multi-turn dialogue. Our approach
includes: (i) EvoSA, an unsupervised data expansion method based on
evolutionary operations and speech act theory; (ii) teacher-model-generated
multi-task supervision; and (iii) progressive knowledge distillation from
complex to simpler tasks. We then constructed the ReaMent dataset with 5,000
real-world dialogue samples, using a MentalMAC-distilled model to assist human
annotation. Vast experiments demonstrate that our method significantly narrows
the gap between student and teacher models and outperforms competitive LLMs
across key evaluation metrics. All code, datasets, and checkpoints will be

Result: 语言消融显著提升多语言推理性能，语言与推理表示可解耦。

Conclusion: 无训练干预策略轻量且高效，为多语言推理机制提供新见解。

Abstract: Multilingual reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language
models (LLMs), with performance disproportionately favoring high-resource
languages. Drawing inspiration from cognitive neuroscience, which suggests that
human reasoning functions largely independently of language processing, we
hypothesize that LLMs similarly encode reasoning and language as separable
components that can be disentangled to enhance multilingual reasoning. To
evaluate this, we perform a causal intervention by ablating language-specific
representations at inference time. Experiments on 10 open-source LLMs spanning
11 typologically diverse languages show that this language-specific ablation
consistently boosts multilingual reasoning performance. Layer-wise analyses
further confirm that language and reasoning representations can be effectively
decoupled throughout the model, yielding improved multilingual reasoning
capabilities, while preserving top-layer language features remains essential
for maintaining linguistic fidelity. Compared to post-training such as
supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, our training-free ablation
achieves comparable or superior results with minimal computational overhead.
These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms underlying multilingual
reasoning in LLMs and suggest a lightweight and interpretable strategy for
improving cross-lingual generalization.

TLDR: AGENT-X是一个基于多智能体的零样本框架，用于检测AI生成文本，无需依赖标注数据或阈值调整，显著提升了准确性、可解释性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成文本检测方法依赖标注数据和外部阈值调整，限制了可解释性、适应性和零样本效果。

Method: AGENT-X通过语义、风格和结构三个维度组织检测准则，由专门的语言智能体独立评估，并通过语义引导提供显式推理和校准置信度。元智能体通过置信度感知聚合整合评估结果，实现无阈值、可解释的分类。此外，自适应智能体路由器动态选择准则。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验表明，AGENT-X在准确性、可解释性和泛化能力上显著优于现有监督和零样本方法。

Conclusion: AGENT-X通过多智能体框架和语言学指导，解决了现有方法的局限性，为AI生成文本检测提供了更高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing AI-generated text detection methods heavily depend on large
annotated datasets and external threshold tuning, restricting interpretability,
adaptability, and zero-shot effectiveness. To address these limitations, we
propose AGENT-X, a zero-shot multi-agent framework informed by classical
rhetoric and systemic functional linguistics. Specifically, we organize
detection guidelines into semantic, stylistic, and structural dimensions, each
independently evaluated by specialized linguistic agents that provide explicit
reasoning and robust calibrated confidence via semantic steering. A meta agent
integrates these assessments through confidence-aware aggregation, enabling
threshold-free, interpretable classification. Additionally, an adaptive
Mixture-of-Agent router dynamically selects guidelines based on inferred
textual characteristics. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that
AGENT-X substantially surpasses state-of-the-art supervised and zero-shot
approaches in accuracy, interpretability, and generalization.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为Web-Shepherd的过程奖励模型（PRM），用于评估网页导航轨迹，并在性能和成本上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网页导航需要长序列决策，现有方法依赖多模态大语言模型（MLLM）作为奖励模型，但存在速度和成本问题。

Method: 构建了WebPRM Collection数据集和WebRewardBench基准，并开发了Web-Shepherd PRM模型。

Result: Web-Shepherd在WebRewardBench上比GPT-4o准确率高30分，在WebArena-lite上性能提升10.9分且成本更低。

Conclusion: Web-Shepherd为网页导航提供了一种高效且经济的解决方案，相关资源已公开。

Abstract: Web navigation is a unique domain that can automate many repetitive real-life
tasks and is challenging as it requires long-horizon sequential decision making
beyond typical multimodal large language model (MLLM) tasks. Yet, specialized
reward models for web navigation that can be utilized during both training and
test-time have been absent until now. Despite the importance of speed and
cost-effectiveness, prior works have utilized MLLMs as reward models, which
poses significant constraints for real-world deployment. To address this, in
this work, we propose the first process reward model (PRM) called Web-Shepherd
which could assess web navigation trajectories in a step-level. To achieve
this, we first construct the WebPRM Collection, a large-scale dataset with 40K
step-level preference pairs and annotated checklists spanning diverse domains
and difficulty levels. Next, we also introduce the WebRewardBench, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for evaluating PRMs. In our experiments, we observe
that our Web-Shepherd achieves about 30 points better accuracy compared to
using GPT-4o on WebRewardBench. Furthermore, when testing on WebArena-lite by
using GPT-4o-mini as the policy and Web-Shepherd as the verifier, we achieve
10.9 points better performance, in 10 less cost compared to using GPT-4o-mini
as the verifier. Our model, dataset, and code are publicly available at LINK.

Conclusion: DebackX模型为复杂场景下的图像内机器翻译提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate texts within images
from one language to another. Previous research on IIMT was primarily conducted
on simplified scenarios such as images of one-line text with black font in
white backgrounds, which is far from reality and impractical for applications
in the real world. To make IIMT research practically valuable, it is essential
to consider a complex scenario where the text backgrounds are derived from
real-world images. To facilitate research of complex scenario IIMT, we design
an IIMT dataset that includes subtitle text with real-world background. However
previous IIMT models perform inadequately in complex scenarios. To address the
issue, we propose the DebackX model, which separates the background and
text-image from the source image, performs translation on text-image directly,
and fuses the translated text-image with the background, to generate the target
image. Experimental results show that our model achieves improvements in both
translation quality and visual effect.

Result: 幻觉在生成长文本的后半部分集中出现，可能与长序列的注意力机制有关。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text generation
capabilities, including tasks like summarization, often producing coherent and
fluent outputs. However, faithfulness to source material remains a significant
challenge due to the generation of hallucinations. While extensive research
focuses on detecting and reducing these inaccuracies, less attention has been
paid to the positional distribution of hallucination within generated text,
particularly in long outputs. In this work, we investigate where hallucinations
occur in LLM-based long response generation, using long document summarization
as a key case study. Focusing on the challenging setting of long context-aware
long response generation, we find a consistent and concerning phenomenon:
hallucinations tend to concentrate disproportionately in the latter parts of
the generated long response. To understand this bias, we explore potential
contributing factors related to the dynamics of attention and decoding over
long sequences. Furthermore, we investigate methods to mitigate this positional
hallucination, aiming to improve faithfulness specifically in the concluding
segments of long outputs.

TLDR: ToxiRewriteCN是中国首个专注于保留情感极性的中文去毒数据集，包含1,556个标注三元组，涵盖多种毒性场景。评估17种LLM后发现，商业和MoE模型表现最佳，但所有模型在复杂场景中平衡安全性和情感保真度仍有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线交流中，去毒化内容的同时保留说话者意图是重要但困难的课题，尤其在中文中，毒性常隐含于表情符号、谐音或语境中。

Method: 构建ToxiRewriteCN数据集，包含毒性句子、情感对齐的非毒性改写及标注毒性范围，覆盖五种场景。评估17种LLM在去毒准确性、流畅性、内容保留和情感极性四个维度。

Result: 商业和MoE模型整体表现最佳，但所有模型在表情符号、谐音和对话等复杂场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: ToxiRewriteCN为中文可控、情感感知的去毒研究提供了支持，未来需改进模型在复杂场景中的表现。

Abstract: Detoxifying offensive language while preserving the speaker's original intent
is a challenging yet critical goal for improving the quality of online
interactions. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in rewriting
toxic content, they often default to overly polite rewrites, distorting the
emotional tone and communicative intent. This problem is especially acute in
Chinese, where toxicity often arises implicitly through emojis, homophones, or
discourse context. We present ToxiRewriteCN, the first Chinese detoxification
dataset explicitly designed to preserve sentiment polarity. The dataset
comprises 1,556 carefully annotated triplets, each containing a toxic sentence,
a sentiment-aligned non-toxic rewrite, and labeled toxic spans. It covers five
real-world scenarios: standard expressions, emoji-induced and homophonic
toxicity, as well as single-turn and multi-turn dialogues. We evaluate 17 LLMs,
including commercial and open-source models with variant architectures, across
four dimensions: detoxification accuracy, fluency, content preservation, and
sentiment polarity. Results show that while commercial and MoE models perform
best overall, all models struggle to balance safety with emotional fidelity in
more subtle or context-heavy settings such as emoji, homophone, and
dialogue-based inputs. We release ToxiRewriteCN to support future research on
controllable, sentiment-aware detoxification for Chinese.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用关键词的引导潜力，且未区分问题特定和文档特定关键词的不同作用。

Method: 定义了双视角关键词（问题关键词和文档关键词），并提出了DPKG框架，结合扩展的Transformer编码器和两个答案感知的Transformer解码器。

Result: 实验证明DPKG框架在多跳问题生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: DPKG框架通过双视角关键词的协同作用，显著提升了多跳问题生成的性能。

Abstract: Multi-hop question generation (MQG) aims to generate questions that require
synthesizing multiple information snippets from documents to derive target
answers. The primary challenge lies in effectively pinpointing crucial
information snippets related to question-answer (QA) pairs, typically relying
on keywords. However, existing works fail to fully utilize the guiding
potential of keywords and neglect to differentiate the distinct roles of
question-specific and document-specific keywords. To address this, we define
dual-perspective keywords (i.e., question and document keywords) and propose a
Dual-Perspective Keyword-Guided (DPKG) framework, which seamlessly integrates
keywords into the multi-hop question generation process. We argue that question
keywords capture the questioner's intent, whereas document keywords reflect the
content related to the QA pair. Functionally, question and document keywords
work together to pinpoint essential information snippets in the document, with
question keywords required to appear in the generated question. The DPKG
framework consists of an expanded transformer encoder and two answer-aware
transformer decoders for keyword and question generation, respectively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our work, showcasing its
promising performance and underscoring its significant value in the MQG task.

Result: 实验显示大型语言模型在新任务中优于监督模型和人类支持者，表现出更全面的支持能力。

Conclusion: 重新定义的情感支持对话任务更符合实际需求，大型语言模型在此任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversations (ESC) are crucial for providing empathy,
validation, and actionable guidance to individuals in distress. However,
existing definitions of the ESC task oversimplify the structure of supportive
responses, typically modelling them as single strategy-utterance pairs. Through
a detailed corpus analysis of the ESConv dataset, we identify a common yet
previously overlooked phenomenon: emotional supporters often employ multiple
strategies consecutively within a single turn. We formally redefine the ESC
task to account for this, proposing a revised formulation that requires
generating the full sequence of strategy-utterance pairs given a dialogue
history. To facilitate this refined task, we introduce several modelling
approaches, including supervised deep learning models and large language
models. Our experiments show that, under this redefined task, state-of-the-art
LLMs outperform both supervised models and human supporters. Notably, contrary
to some earlier findings, we observe that LLMs frequently ask questions and
provide suggestions, demonstrating more holistic support capabilities.

*Silvia Cappelletti,Tobia Poppi,Samuele Poppi,Zheng-Xin Yong,Diego Garcia-Olano,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为*prefilling attack*的简单方法，通过在模型输出前添加结构化前缀（如"The correct option is:"），显著提高了基于*first-token probability*（FTP）的多选题问答（MCQA）任务的准确性、校准性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于FTP的评估方法存在脆弱性，如模型可能对无关标记赋予高概率（*misalignment*）或将有效标记误用为通用前缀（*misinterpretation*），影响符号化评估的可靠性。

Method: 提出*prefilling attack*，即在模型输出前添加结构化自然语言前缀，引导模型生成清晰有效的选项，无需修改模型参数。

Result: 实验表明，带前缀的FTP策略在多种LLM和MCQA基准测试中显著提升了性能，优于标准FTP，且与需要完整解码和外部分类器的开放生成方法性能相当，同时更高效。

Conclusion: *prefilling attack*是一种简单、鲁棒且低成本的方法，可显著提升基于FTP的MCQA评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on multiple-choice
question answering (MCQA) tasks using *first-token probability* (FTP), which
selects the answer option whose initial token has the highest likelihood. While
efficient, FTP can be fragile: models may assign high probability to unrelated
tokens (*misalignment*) or use a valid token merely as part of a generic
preamble rather than as a clear answer choice (*misinterpretation*),
undermining the reliability of symbolic evaluation. We propose a simple
solution: the *prefilling attack*, a structured natural-language prefix (e.g.,
"*The correct option is:*") prepended to the model output. Originally explored
in AI safety, we repurpose prefilling to steer the model to respond with a
clean, valid option, without modifying its parameters. Empirically, the FTP
with prefilling strategy substantially improves accuracy, calibration, and
output consistency across a broad set of LLMs and MCQA benchmarks. It
outperforms standard FTP and often matches the performance of open-ended
generation approaches that require full decoding and external classifiers,
while being significantly more efficient. Our findings suggest that prefilling
is a simple, robust, and low-cost method to enhance the reliability of
FTP-based evaluation in multiple-choice settings.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于单元语言的文本无关语音到语音翻译方法，解决了跨模态和跨语言对齐的挑战，并通过任务提示建模优化了多任务学习中的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音到语音翻译（S2ST）面临跨模态特征提取和跨语言长序列对齐的挑战，需要一种新的表示格式来克服这些问题。

Method: 使用单元语言作为文本类似表示格式，通过n-gram语言建模构建，并采用多任务学习和任务提示建模优化模型训练。

Result: 在Voxpupil数据集的四种语言上，方法显著优于基线模型，性能接近基于文本的模型。

Conclusion: 单元语言和任务提示建模有效解决了S2ST的挑战，为无文本语音翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: The success of building textless speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) models
has attracted much attention. However, S2ST still faces two main challenges: 1)
extracting linguistic features for various speech signals, called cross-modal
(CM), and 2) learning alignment of difference languages in long sequences,
called cross-lingual (CL). We propose the unit language to overcome the two
modeling challenges. The unit language can be considered a text-like
representation format, constructed using $n$-gram language modeling. We
implement multi-task learning to utilize the unit language in guiding the
speech modeling process. Our initial results reveal a conflict when applying
source and target unit languages simultaneously. We propose task prompt
modeling to mitigate this conflict. We conduct experiments on four languages of
the Voxpupil dataset. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over a
strong baseline and achieves performance comparable to models trained with
text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有改写攻击方法需要大量数据和计算资源训练专用改写器，且面对先进检测算法时效果下降，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: CoPA通过设计指令引导LLM生成更人类化的文本，并构建辅助的机器特征分布，在解码过程中消除机器特征。

Result: 实验验证了CoPA在多种场景下能有效欺骗文本检测器。

Conclusion: CoPA是一种高效、无需训练的改写攻击方法，能显著提升对抗文本检测器的能力。

Abstract: The misuse of large language models (LLMs), such as academic plagiarism, has
driven the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. To bypass
these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these
texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require
substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser,
and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection
algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive
\textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that
effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is
to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like
texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can
still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes
that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an
auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like
distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns
from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to
produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical
analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various
scenarios.

TLDR: FlowKV提出了一种多轮隔离机制，用于管理KV Cache，避免重复压缩早期对话内容，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多轮对话中，KV Cache的线性增长带来高昂计算成本，现有策略因重复压缩导致信息丢失和上下文遗忘。

Method: FlowKV采用多轮隔离机制，仅对新生成的KV对进行压缩，避免旧内容的重复压缩。

Result: FlowKV在指令跟随准确性和用户偏好保留上显著优于基线策略，提升幅度从10.90%到75.40%。

Conclusion: FlowKV有效解决了KV Cache管理中的信息丢失问题，显著提升了多轮对话性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn
conversational applications, where the management of the Key-Value (KV) Cache
presents a significant bottleneck. The linear growth of the KV Cache with
dialogue history imposes substantial computational costs, and existing eviction
strategies often degrade performance by repeatedly compressing early
conversational context, leading to information loss and context forgetting.
This paper introduces FlowKV, a novel \textbf{multi-turn isolation mechanism}
for KV Cache management, which can be applied to any KV Cache compression
method without training. FlowKV's core innovation is a multi-turn isolation
mechanism that preserves the accumulated compressed KV cache from past turns.
Compression is then strategically applied only to the newly generated KV pairs
of the latest completed turn, effectively preventing the re-compression of
older context and thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our results
demonstrate that FlowKV consistently and significantly outperforms baseline
strategies in maintaining instruction-following accuracy and user preference
retention from 10.90\% to 75.40\%, particularly in later conversational turns.

Conclusion: KL散度能有效揭示语言模型的行为模式，对数似然空间的约束性更强。

Abstract: A recently proposed method enables efficient estimation of the KL divergence
between language models, including models with different architectures, by
assigning coordinates based on log-likelihood vectors. To better understand the
behavior of this metric, we systematically evaluate KL divergence across a wide
range of conditions using publicly available language models. Our analysis
covers comparisons between pretraining checkpoints, fine-tuned and base models,
and layers via the logit lens. We find that trajectories of language models, as
measured by KL divergence, exhibit a spiral structure during pretraining and
thread-like progressions across layers. Furthermore, we show that, in terms of
diffusion exponents, model trajectories in the log-likelihood space are more
constrained than those in weight space.

Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential
for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical
communication technologies. In this study, we investigated
magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during
speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks.
Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone
classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine
learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network
architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding
phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding
accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and
playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available
during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently
outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of
traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and
high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency
bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz)
and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy,
suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural
processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether
decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement
artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological
refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of
examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity,
offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals
with severe speech impairments.

Abstract: Debugging is a critical aspect of LLM's coding ability. Early debugging
efforts primarily focused on code-level analysis, which often falls short when
addressing complex programming errors that require a deeper understanding of
algorithmic logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
shifted attention toward leveraging natural language reasoning to enhance
code-related tasks. However, two fundamental questions remain unanswered: What
type of natural language format is most effective for debugging tasks? And what
specific benefits does natural language reasoning bring to the debugging
process? In this paper, we introduce NL-DEBUGGING, a novel framework that
employs natural language as an intermediate representation to improve code
debugging. By debugging at a natural language level, we demonstrate that
NL-DEBUGGING outperforms traditional debugging methods and enables a broader
modification space through direct refinement guided by execution feedback. Our
findings highlight the potential of natural language reasoning to advance
automated code debugging and address complex programming challenges.

languages worldwide, all of which demand access to comparable agentic services.
Nevertheless, the development of language agents remains inadequate for meeting
the diverse requirements of multilingual agentic applications. To fill this
gap, we introduce X-WebAgentBench, a novel multilingual agent benchmark in an
interactive web environment, which evaluates the planning and interaction
performance of language agents across multiple languages, thereby contributing
to the advancement of global agent intelligence. Additionally, we assess the
performance of various LLMs and cross-lingual alignment methods, examining
their effectiveness in enhancing agents. Our findings reveal that even advanced
models like GPT-4o, when combined with cross-lingual techniques, fail to
achieve satisfactory results. We hope that X-WebAgentBench can serve as a
valuable benchmark for multilingual agent scenario in real-world applications.

TLDR: 论文提出RePPL方法，通过重新校准不确定性测量，解释幻觉来源，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的幻觉问题阻碍其可信使用，现有方法无法解释幻觉的来源。

Method: 提出RePPL方法，从语义传播和语言生成两方面校准不确定性，生成可解释的token级分数。

Result: 实验显示RePPL在多个QA数据集上表现最佳（平均AUC 0.833），并能解释幻觉来源。

Conclusion: RePPL不仅提升检测性能，还能揭示幻觉的混沌模式，具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful, but hallucinations remain
a vital obstacle to their trustworthy use. While previous works improved the
capability of hallucination detection by measuring uncertainty, they all lack
the ability to explain the provenance behind why hallucinations occur, i.e.,
which part of the inputs tends to trigger hallucinations. Recent works on the
prompt attack indicate that uncertainty exists in semantic propagation, where
attention mechanisms gradually fuse local token information into high-level
semantics across layers. Meanwhile, uncertainty also emerges in language
generation, due to its probability-based selection of high-level semantics for
sampled generations. Based on that, we propose RePPL to recalibrate uncertainty
measurement by these two aspects, which dispatches explainable uncertainty
scores to each token and aggregates in Perplexity-style Log-Average form as
total score. Experiments show that our method achieves the best comprehensive
detection performance across various QA datasets on advanced models (average
AUC of 0.833), and our method is capable of producing token-level uncertainty
scores as explanations for the hallucination. Leveraging these scores, we
preliminarily find the chaotic pattern of hallucination and showcase its
promising usage.

TLDR: 研究发现，视觉语言模型（VLMs）在面对真实网络迷因图片时，比面对人工合成图片时更容易产生有害输出，且多轮对话仅能部分缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当前视觉语言模型在真实网络迷因图片下的安全性，揭示其潜在风险。

Method: 引入MemeSafetyBench基准，包含50,430个实例，结合真实迷因图片和有害/无害指令，评估多款VLMs在单轮和多轮交互中的表现。

Result: 迷因图片显著增加有害输出并减少拒绝率，多轮交互仅能部分缓解，模型规模与安全性指标存在关联。

Conclusion: 需开发更具生态效度的评估方法和更强的安全机制。

Abstract: Rapid deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) magnifies safety risks, yet
most evaluations rely on artificial images. This study asks: How safe are
current VLMs when confronted with meme images that ordinary users share? To
investigate this question, we introduce MemeSafetyBench, a 50,430-instance
benchmark pairing real meme images with both harmful and benign instructions.
Using a comprehensive safety taxonomy and LLM-based instruction generation, we
assess multiple VLMs across single and multi-turn interactions. We investigate
how real-world memes influence harmful outputs, the mitigating effects of
conversational context, and the relationship between model scale and safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs show greater vulnerability to
meme-based harmful prompts than to synthetic or typographic images. Memes
significantly increase harmful responses and decrease refusals compared to
text-only inputs. Though multi-turn interactions provide partial mitigation,
elevated vulnerability persists. These results highlight the need for
ecologically valid evaluations and stronger safety mechanisms.

Motivation: 研究LLM是否受锚定效应影响，探索其机制及缓解策略，推动更可信的评估方法。

Method: 引入新数据集SynAnchors，结合评估指标对主流LLM进行基准测试。

Result: LLM普遍存在锚定效应，浅层作用明显，推理可部分缓解。

Conclusion: 建议LLM评估应关注认知偏差，而非传统基准测试。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has advanced natural
language processing, yet concerns about cognitive biases are growing. In this
paper, we investigate the anchoring effect, a cognitive bias where the mind
relies heavily on the first information as anchors to make affected judgments.
We explore whether LLMs are affected by anchoring, the underlying mechanisms,
and potential mitigation strategies. To facilitate studies at scale on the
anchoring effect, we introduce a new dataset, SynAnchors. Combining refined
evaluation metrics, we benchmark current widely used LLMs. Our findings show
that LLMs' anchoring bias exists commonly with shallow-layer acting and is not
eliminated by conventional strategies, while reasoning can offer some
mitigation. This recontextualization via cognitive psychology urges that LLM
evaluations focus not on standard benchmarks or over-optimized robustness
tests, but on cognitive-bias-aware trustworthy evaluation.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理任务上表现优异，但其安全性并未同步提升，甚至可能下降。研究旨在探索如何通过监督微调增强LRMs的安全性。

Method: 通过监督微调（SFT）研究LRMs的安全性提升，分析直接蒸馏安全响应的失败模式，并探索短或模板化推理过程的效果。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success on
reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, their
enhanced reasoning capabilities do not necessarily translate to improved safety
performance-and in some cases, may even degrade it. This raises an important
research question: how can we enhance the safety of LRMs? In this paper, we
present a comprehensive empirical study on how to enhance the safety of LRMs
through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our investigation begins with an
unexpected observation: directly distilling safe responses from DeepSeek-R1
fails to significantly enhance safety. We analyze this phenomenon and identify
three key failure patterns that contribute to it. We then demonstrate that
explicitly addressing these issues during the data distillation process can
lead to substantial safety improvements. Next, we explore whether a long and
complex reasoning process is necessary for achieving safety. Interestingly, we
find that simply using short or template-based reasoning process can attain
comparable safety performance-and are significantly easier for models to learn
than more intricate reasoning chains. These findings prompt a deeper reflection
on the role of reasoning in ensuring safety. Finally, we find that mixing math
reasoning data during safety fine-tuning is helpful to balance safety and
over-refusal. Overall, we hope our empirical study could provide a more
holistic picture on enhancing the safety of LRMs. The code and data used in our
experiments are released in https://github.com/thu-coai/LRM-Safety-Study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的持续学习方法可能导致遗忘，需改进。

Method: 为每个新任务扩展LoRA分支，并引入门控模块控制新旧分支贡献。

Result: 实验证明GainLoRA优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GainLoRA通过门控机制显著提升持续学习性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL), which requires the model to learn multiple tasks
sequentially, is crucial for language models (LMs). Recently, low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), one of the most representative parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, has gained increasing attention in CL of LMs.
However, most existing CL methods based on LoRA typically expand a new LoRA
branch to learn each new task and force the new and old LoRA branches to
contribute equally to old tasks, potentially leading to forgetting. In this
work, we propose a new method, called gated integration of low-rank adaptation
(GainLoRA), for CL of LMs. GainLoRA expands a new LoRA branch for each new task
and introduces gating modules to integrate the new and old LoRA branches.
Furthermore, GainLoRA leverages the new gating module to minimize the
contribution from the new LoRA branch to old tasks, effectively mitigating
forgetting and improving the model's overall performance. Experimental results
on CL benchmarks demonstrate that GainLoRA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 扩散模型可能生成NSFW内容或社会偏见，现有方法效果不佳且影响正常输出。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效减少NSFW内容和社会偏见，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了扩散模型的社会责任，且可与现有方法结合使用。

Abstract: The remarkable ability of diffusion models to generate high-fidelity images
has led to their widespread adoption. However, concerns have also arisen
regarding their potential to produce Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content and
exhibit social biases, hindering their practical use in real-world
applications. In response to this challenge, prior work has focused on
employing security filters to identify and exclude toxic text, or
alternatively, fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models to erase sensitive
concepts. Unfortunately, existing methods struggle to achieve satisfactory
performance in the sense that they can have a significant impact on the normal
model output while still failing to prevent the generation of harmful content
in some cases. In this paper, we propose a novel self-discovery approach to
identifying a semantic direction vector in the embedding space to restrict text
embedding within a safe region. Our method circumvents the need for correcting
individual words within the input text and steers the entire text prompt
towards a safe region in the embedding space, thereby enhancing model
robustness against all possibly unsafe prompts. In addition, we employ Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) for semantic direction vector initialization to reduce the
impact on the model performance for other semantics. Furthermore, our method
can also be integrated with existing methods to improve their social
responsibility. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our method can effectively reduce NSFW content and mitigate social bias
generated by diffusion models compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建语言模型映射的计算成本高，主要取决于文本数量，因此需要一种方法减少计算负担。

Method: 采用重采样方法，根据每个文本在不同模型下对数似然的方差选择重要性文本，减少所需文本数量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法仅需约一半文本即可达到与均匀采样相当的KL散度估计准确性，并支持高效扩展新模型。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了语言模型映射的高效和可扩展构建。

Abstract: We address the computational cost of constructing a model map, which embeds
diverse language models into a common space for comparison via KL divergence.
The map relies on log-likelihoods over a large text set, making the cost
proportional to the number of texts. To reduce this cost, we propose a
resampling method that selects important texts with weights proportional to the
variance of log-likelihoods across models for each text. Our method
significantly reduces the number of required texts while preserving the
accuracy of KL divergence estimates. Experiments show that it achieves
comparable performance to uniform sampling with about half as many texts, and
also facilitates efficient incorporation of new models into an existing map.
These results enable scalable and efficient construction of language model
maps.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly advance, we introduce Hunyuan-TurboS,
a novel large hybrid Transformer-Mamba Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. It
synergistically combines Mamba's long-sequence processing efficiency with
Transformer's superior contextual understanding. Hunyuan-TurboS features an
adaptive long-short chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism, dynamically switching
between rapid responses for simple queries and deep "thinking" modes for
complex problems, optimizing computational resources. Architecturally, this 56B
activated (560B total) parameter model employs 128 layers (Mamba2, Attention,
FFN) with an innovative AMF/MF block pattern. Faster Mamba2 ensures linear
complexity, Grouped-Query Attention minimizes KV cache, and FFNs use an MoE
structure. Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context
length and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our
comprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised
Fine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method,
Multi-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage
Large-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general

on LMSYS Chatbot Arena with a score of 1356, outperforming leading models like
Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 (1352) and o4-mini-2025-04-16 (1345). TurboS also achieves

Motivation: 探索知识蒸馏在小规模语言模型中的效果及知识转移机制，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 在14个复杂推理任务上，对0.5B到7B参数的模型进行零样本设置下的KD实验，并进行统计和相关性分析。

Result: KD显著提升小模型性能（平均10%），但对大模型效果有限；教师任务专长比性能更重要；学生推理忠实性与性能提升不一致。

Conclusion: KD对小模型效果显著，但需注意推理忠实性问题；教师信号和logit平滑对蒸馏效果至关重要。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large language
models into smaller ones while preserving performance. Despite the recent
traction of KD research, its effectiveness for smaller language models (LMs)
and the mechanisms driving knowledge transfer remain underexplored. In this
work, we present the first large-scale empirical and statistical analysis of KD
across models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters on 14 complex reasoning tasks
in a zero-shot setting. Our findings reveal that KD can improve the average
performance of smaller models by up to $10\%$, with a peak task specific gain
of $22\%$, while providing only marginal benefits ($\sim 1.3\%$) for larger
models. Surprisingly, teacher performance has a minimal impact on student
outcomes, while teacher task expertise impacts KD effectiveness. A correlation
study indicates that smaller LMs benefit more from KD, whereas larger LMs show
diminished gains. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between improvements
in student performance and reasoning fidelity, suggesting that while KD
enhances accuracy, it does not always maintain the structured decision-making
processes of the teacher. Our ablation study further highlights the importance
of teacher signals and logit smoothing in influencing students' performance
after distillation. Overall, our study offers a comprehensive empirical and
statistical assessment of KD, highlighting both its benefits and trade-offs
when distilling knowledge from larger to smaller LMs.

Conclusion: AdUE1是一种轻量级方法，无需修改基础模型，且能产生更校准的置信度。

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation remains a critical challenge in adapting pre-trained
language models to classification tasks, particularly under parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approaches such as adapters. We introduce AdUE1, an efficient
post-hoc uncertainty estimation (UE) method, to enhance softmax-based
estimates. Our approach (1) uses a differentiable approximation of the maximum
function and (2) applies additional regularization through L2-SP, anchoring the
fine-tuned head weights and regularizing the model. Evaluations on five NLP
classification datasets across four language models (RoBERTa, ELECTRA, LLaMA-2,
Qwen) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms established
baselines such as Mahalanobis distance and softmax response. Our approach is
lightweight (no base-model changes) and produces better-calibrated confidence.

Result: 在五个开放域问答数据集上的实验证明了RoleRAG的有效性、通用性和灵活性。

Abstract: Existing studies have optimized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) across
various sub-tasks, such as query understanding and retrieval refinement, but
integrating these optimizations into a unified framework remains challenging.
To tackle this problem, this work proposes RoleRAG, a unified RAG framework
that achieves efficient multi-task processing through role-specific token
optimization. RoleRAG comprises six modules, each handling a specific sub-task
within the RAG process. Additionally, we introduce a query graph to represent
the decomposition of the query, which can be dynamically resolved according to
the decomposing state. All modules are driven by the same underlying LLM,
distinguished by task-specific role tokens that are individually optimized.
This design allows RoleRAG to dynamically activate different modules within a
single LLM instance, thereby streamlining deployment and reducing resource
consumption. Experimental results on five open-domain question-answering
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generalizability, and flexibility of
our framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出RLPA框架，通过强化学习动态优化用户画像，提升个性化对话效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示和离线优化的方法在冷启动和长期个性化方面表现不足。

Method: RLPA框架通过模拟用户模型迭代优化用户画像，采用双奖励机制（画像奖励和响应奖励）。

Result: Qwen-RLPA在个性化对话中表现优异，超越现有基线及商业模型。

Conclusion: 动态画像推断是构建个性化对话系统的更有效范式。

Abstract: Personalized alignment is essential for enabling large language models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric dialogue. While recent prompt-based and
offline optimization methods offer preliminary solutions, they fall short in
cold-start scenarios and long-term personalization due to their inherently
static and shallow designs. In this work, we introduce the Reinforcement
Learning for Personalized Alignment (RLPA) framework, in which an LLM interacts
with a simulated user model to iteratively infer and refine user profiles
through dialogue. The training process is guided by a dual-level reward
structure: the Profile Reward encourages accurate construction of user
representations, while the Response Reward incentivizes generation of responses
consistent with the inferred profile. We instantiate RLPA by fine-tuning
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, resulting in Qwen-RLPA, which achieves state-of-the-art
performance in personalized dialogue. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
Qwen-RLPA consistently outperforms prompting and offline fine-tuning baselines,
and even surpasses advanced commercial models such as Claude-3.5 and GPT-4o.
Further analysis highlights Qwen-RLPA's robustness in reconciling conflicting
user preferences, sustaining long-term personalization and delivering more
efficient inference compared to recent reasoning-focused LLMs. These results
emphasize the potential of dynamic profile inference as a more effective
paradigm for building personalized dialogue systems.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在增量学习新任务时出现的灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法在现实场景中存在严格限制。

Method: 引入flashbacks（旧任务的少量提示），约束模型输出的偏差，并在flashbacks和新任务之间插值潜在任务，实现联合学习。

Result: 在1000+任务上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了新任务的泛化能力并减少了旧任务的遗忘。

Conclusion: Joint Flashback Adaptation是一种无需重放数据、任务无关的有效方法，适用于大语言模型的增量学习。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks.
However, it is challenging for them to learn new tasks incrementally due to
catastrophic forgetting. Existing approaches rely on experience replay,
optimization constraints, or task differentiation, which encounter strict
limitations in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose Joint
Flashback Adaptation. We first introduce flashbacks -- a limited number of
prompts from old tasks -- when adapting to new tasks and constrain the
deviations of the model outputs compared to the original one. We then
interpolate latent tasks between flashbacks and new tasks to enable jointly
learning relevant latent tasks, new tasks, and flashbacks, alleviating data
sparsity in flashbacks and facilitating knowledge sharing for smooth
adaptation. Our method requires only a limited number of flashbacks without
access to the replay data and is task-agnostic. We conduct extensive
experiments on state-of-the-art large language models across 1000+
instruction-following tasks, arithmetic reasoning tasks, and general reasoning
tasks. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our method in
improving generalization on new tasks and reducing forgetting in old tasks.

Result: 实验表明，CoLA在低样本情况下优于现有PEFT方法，表现出更高的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoLA为多任务场景提供了一种更灵活的解决方案，显著提升了性能，尤其是在样本稀缺的情况下。

Abstract: The scaling law of Large Language Models (LLMs) reveals a power-law
relationship, showing diminishing return on performance as model scale
increases. While training LLMs from scratch is resource-intensive, fine-tuning
a pre-trained model for specific tasks has become a practical alternative. Full
fine-tuning (FFT) achieves strong performance; however, it is computationally
expensive and inefficient. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, like
LoRA, have been proposed to address these challenges by freezing the
pre-trained model and adding lightweight task-specific modules. LoRA, in
particular, has proven effective, but its application to multi-task scenarios
is limited by interference between tasks. Recent approaches, such as
Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) and asymmetric LoRA, have aimed to mitigate these
issues but still struggle with sample scarcity and noise interference due to
their fixed structure. In response, we propose CoLA, a more flexible LoRA
architecture with an efficient initialization scheme, and introduces three
collaborative strategies to enhance performance by better utilizing the
quantitative relationships between matrices $A$ and $B$. Our experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of CoLA, outperforming existing
PEFT methods, especially in low-sample scenarios. Our data and code are fully
publicly available at https://github.com/zyy-2001/CoLA.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in diverse reasoning tasks, yet their application to complex
physics reasoning remains underexplored. Physics reasoning presents unique
challenges, requiring grounding in physical conditions and the interpretation
of multimodal information. Current physics benchmarks are limited, often
focusing on text-only inputs or solely on problem-solving, thereby overlooking
the critical intermediate steps of variable identification and process
formulation. To address these limitations, we introduce PhysicsArena, the first
multimodal physics reasoning benchmark designed to holistically evaluate MLLMs
across three critical dimensions: variable identification, physical process
formulation, and solution derivation. PhysicsArena aims to provide a
comprehensive platform for assessing and advancing the multimodal physics
reasoning abilities of MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出GenBiasEval和GenHintEval数据集及AFGB-Score和UB-Score评估指标，用于量化LLMs中的性别偏见；并提出LFTF算法，通过定位和微调显著减少偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs因训练数据中的社会偏见（尤其是性别偏见）而表现出偏见，需有效评估和缓解。

Method: 提出GenBiasEval和GenHintEval数据集及相应评分指标；设计LFTF算法，通过BMI评分定位偏见相关模块并微调。

Result: 实验表明LFTF算法能显著减少LLMs的性别偏见，同时保持其通用能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法和算法有效评估并缓解了LLMs中的性别偏见。

Abstract: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted widespread attention
due to their powerful performance. However, due to the unavoidable exposure to
socially biased data during training, LLMs tend to exhibit social biases,
particularly gender bias. To better explore and quantifying the degree of
gender bias in LLMs, we propose a pair of datasets named GenBiasEval and
GenHintEval, respectively. The GenBiasEval is responsible for evaluating the
degree of gender bias in LLMs, accompanied by an evaluation metric named
AFGB-Score (Absolutely Fair Gender Bias Score). Meanwhile, the GenHintEval is
used to assess whether LLMs can provide responses consistent with prompts that
contain gender hints, along with the accompanying evaluation metric UB-Score
(UnBias Score). Besides, in order to mitigate gender bias in LLMs more
effectively, we present the LFTF (Locating First and Then Fine-Tuning)
algorithm.The algorithm first ranks specific LLM blocks by their relevance to
gender bias in descending order using a metric called BMI (Block Mitigating
Importance Score). Based on this ranking, the block most strongly associated
with gender bias is then fine-tuned using a carefully designed loss function.
Numerous experiments have shown that our proposed LFTF algorithm can
significantly mitigate gender bias in LLMs while maintaining their general
capabilities.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为KaFT的知识感知微调方法，通过根据知识冲突级别调整训练权重，显著提升了大型语言模型在领域特定问答任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现，传统的监督微调（SFT）方法在训练数据与模型内部知识冲突时表现不佳，因此需要一种更有效的方法来处理冲突数据。

Method: 设计了查询多样化策略以检测冲突，并提出了KaFT方法，通过为不同冲突级别的训练样本分配不同奖励来调整训练权重。

Result: 实验表明，KaFT在四种大型语言模型上均带来一致且显著的性能提升，同时提高了模型泛化能力并减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: KaFT是一种简单而有效的方法，能够通过知识冲突感知显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a common approach to improve the
domain-specific question-answering (QA) performance of large language models
(LLMs). However, recent literature reveals that due to the conflicts between
LLMs' internal knowledge and the context knowledge of training data, vanilla
SFT using the full QA training set is usually suboptimal. In this paper, we
first design a query diversification strategy for robust conflict detection and
then conduct a series of experiments to analyze the impact of knowledge
conflict. We find that 1) training samples with varied conflicts contribute
differently, where SFT on the data with large conflicts leads to catastrophic
performance drops; 2) compared to directly filtering out the conflict data,
appropriately applying the conflict data would be more beneficial. Motivated by
this, we propose a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Fine-tuning (namely
KaFT) approach to effectively boost LLMs' performance. The core of KaFT is to
adapt the training weight by assigning different rewards for different training
samples according to conflict level. Extensive experiments show that KaFT
brings consistent and significant improvements across four LLMs. More analyses
prove that KaFT effectively improves the model generalization and alleviates
the hallucination.

Motivation: 研究LLMs如何将预训练中记忆的token序列转化为可重用的知识，并通过泛化利用这些知识。

Method: 将protoknowledge分为词汇、层次和拓扑形式，并通过知识激活任务（KATs）测量其性质，如语义偏差。同时研究不同提示策略对Text-to-SPARQL性能的影响。

Result: 提出了一种新的分析框架，评估模型预测是否与相关protoknowledge的成功激活一致，为探索语义级数据污染提供了实用工具。

Conclusion: 该方法是闭预训练模型的有效策略，为理解LLMs知识利用提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce the concept of protoknowledge to formalize and measure how
sequences of tokens encoding Knowledge Graphs are internalized during
pretraining and utilized at inference time by Large Language Models (LLMs).
Indeed, LLMs have demonstrated the ability to memorize vast amounts of token
sequences during pretraining, and a central open question is how they leverage
this memorization as reusable knowledge through generalization. We then
categorize protoknowledge into lexical, hierarchical, and topological forms,
varying on the type of knowledge that needs to be activated. We measure
protoknowledge through Knowledge Activation Tasks (KATs), analyzing its general
properties such as semantic bias. We then investigate the impact of
protoknowledge on Text-to-SPARQL performance by varying prompting strategies
depending on input conditions. To this end, we adopt a novel analysis framework
that assesses whether model predictions align with the successful activation of
the relevant protoknowledge for each query. This methodology provides a
practical tool to explore Semantic-Level Data Contamination and serves as an
effective strategy for Closed-Pretraining models.

Conclusion: MITT方法有效解决了多语言推理中的不一致性问题，为低资源语言提供了性能提升的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a widely adopted inference-time strategy for
boosting reasoning performance. However, its effectiveness has been studied
almost exclusively in English, leaving its behavior in other languages largely
unexplored. We present the first systematic study of test-time scaling in
multilingual settings, evaluating DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLama-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B across both high- and low-resource Latin-script
languages. Our findings reveal that the relative gains from test-time scaling
vary significantly across languages. Additionally, models frequently switch to
English mid-reasoning, even when operating under strictly monolingual prompts.
We further show that low-resource languages not only produce initial reasoning
thoughts that differ significantly from English but also have lower internal
consistency across generations in their early reasoning. Building on our
findings, we introduce MITT (Multilingual Initial Thought Transfer), an
unsupervised and lightweight reasoning prefix-tuning approach that transfers
high-resource reasoning prefixes to enhance test-time scaling across all
languages, addressing inconsistencies in multilingual reasoning performance.
MITT significantly boosts DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B's reasoning performance,
especially for underrepresented languages.

Conclusion: BiasLens为偏差发现提供了可扩展、可解释且高效的范式，有助于提升LLM的公平性和透明度。

Abstract: Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly undermines their
reliability and fairness. We focus on a common form of bias: when two reference
concepts in the model's concept space, such as sentiment polarities (e.g.,
"positive" and "negative"), are asymmetrically correlated with a third, target
concept, such as a reviewing aspect, the model exhibits unintended bias. For
instance, the understanding of "food" should not skew toward any particular
sentiment. Existing bias evaluation methods assess behavioral differences of
LLMs by constructing labeled data for different social groups and measuring
model responses across them, a process that requires substantial human effort
and captures only a limited set of social concepts. To overcome these
limitations, we propose BiasLens, a test-set-free bias analysis framework based
on the structure of the model's vector space. BiasLens combines Concept
Activation Vectors (CAVs) with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract
interpretable concept representations, and quantifies bias by measuring the
variation in representational similarity between the target concept and each of
the reference concepts. Even without labeled data, BiasLens shows strong
agreement with traditional bias evaluation metrics (Spearman correlation r >
0.85). Moreover, BiasLens reveals forms of bias that are difficult to detect
using existing methods. For example, in simulated clinical scenarios, a
patient's insurance status can cause the LLM to produce biased diagnostic
assessments. Overall, BiasLens offers a scalable, interpretable, and efficient
paradigm for bias discovery, paving the way for improving fairness and
transparency in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLM）能力的QA和RC基准测试存在偏见，未能覆盖不同人口或地区的代表性内容，可能源于创建者多样性不足。

Method: 对30篇基准论文进行定性内容分析，并对20个基准数据集进行定量分析，探讨创建者、偏见过滤措施及内容偏见的关系。

Result: 大多数基准论文未提供足够信息说明创建者背景，仅一篇明确报告了解决社会代表性问题的措施。数据还揭示了性别、宗教和地理偏见。

Conclusion: 需要更透明和偏见过滤的基准创建方法，以促进公平LLM的发展。

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) and reading comprehension (RC) benchmarks are
essential for assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
retrieving and reproducing knowledge. However, we demonstrate that popular QA
and RC benchmarks are biased and do not cover questions about different
demographics or regions in a representative way, potentially due to a lack of
diversity of those involved in their creation. We perform a qualitative content
analysis of 30 benchmark papers and a quantitative analysis of 20 respective
benchmark datasets to learn (1) who is involved in the benchmark creation, (2)
how social bias is addressed or prevented, and (3) whether the demographics of
the creators and annotators correspond to particular biases in the content.
Most analyzed benchmark papers provided insufficient information regarding the
stakeholders involved in benchmark creation, particularly the annotators.
Notably, just one of the benchmark papers explicitly reported measures taken to
address social representation issues. Moreover, the data analysis revealed
gender, religion, and geographic biases across a wide range of encyclopedic,
commonsense, and scholarly benchmarks. More transparent and bias-aware QA and
RC benchmark creation practices are needed to facilitate better scrutiny and
incentivize the development of fairer LLMs.

Abstract: Critical questions are essential resources to provoke critical thinking when
encountering an argumentative text. We present our system for the Critical
Questions Generation (CQs-Gen) Shared Task at ArgMining 2025. Our approach
leverages large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought prompting to
generate critical questions guided by Walton's argumentation schemes. For each
input intervention, we conversationally prompt LLMs to instantiate the
corresponding argument scheme template to first obtain structured arguments,
and then generate relevant critical questions. Following this, we rank all the
available critical questions by prompting LLMs to select the top 3 most helpful
questions based on the original intervention text. This combination of
structured argumentation theory and step-by-step reasoning enables the
generation of contextually relevant and diverse critical questions. Our
pipeline achieves competitive performance in the final test set, showing its
potential to foster critical thinking given argumentative text and detect
missing or uninformed claims. Code available at

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM accuracy by adding passages
retrieved from an external corpus to the LLM prompt. This paper investigates
how positional bias - the tendency of LLMs to weight information differently
based on its position in the prompt - affects not only the LLM's capability to
capitalize on relevant passages, but also its susceptibility to distracting
passages. Through extensive experiments on three benchmarks, we show how
state-of-the-art retrieval pipelines, while attempting to retrieve relevant
passages, systematically bring highly distracting ones to the top ranks, with
over 60% of queries containing at least one highly distracting passage among
the top-10 retrieved passages. As a result, the impact of the LLM positional
bias, which in controlled settings is often reported as very prominent by
related works, is actually marginal in real scenarios since both relevant and
distracting passages are, in turn, penalized. Indeed, our findings reveal that
sophisticated strategies that attempt to rearrange the passages based on LLM
positional preferences do not perform better than random shuffling.

adapt LLMs into effective tutors using simulated student-tutor interactions by
emphasizing pedagogical quality and guided problem-solving over simply giving
away answers. We use our method to train a 7B parameter tutor model without
human annotations which reaches similar performance to larger proprietary
models like LearnLM. We introduce a controllable reward weighting to balance
pedagogical support and student solving accuracy, allowing us to trace the
Pareto frontier between these two objectives. Our models better preserve
reasoning capabilities than single-turn SFT baselines and can optionally
enhance interpretability through thinking tags that expose the model's
instructional planning.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的方法LASER和其改进版LASER-D，通过长度奖励塑造提升大型推理模型的效率，显著减少了冗余推理并提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在生成长推理链时存在冗余问题，限制了效率。本文旨在通过强化学习方法提升推理效率。

Method: 提出了统一框架，基于长度奖励塑造设计了LASER方法，并进一步扩展为动态和难度感知的LASER-D。

Result: 实验表明，LASER-D在多个模型上显著提升了推理性能和效率，如AIME2024得分提高6.1%，同时减少63%的token使用。

Conclusion: LASER-D通过动态和难度感知的奖励塑造，实现了性能与效率的帕累托最优平衡，减少了冗余推理。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
complex problems through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly by
generating long reasoning traces. However, these extended outputs often exhibit
substantial redundancy, which limits the efficiency of LRMs. In this paper, we
investigate RL-based approaches to promote reasoning efficiency. Specifically,
we first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient
reasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on
this perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method
(LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target
length. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal
balance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based
on two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during
training, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and
dynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of
thought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be
difficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries.
This approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow
thinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff. The resulting method is termed
LASER-D (Dynamic and Difficulty-aware). Experiments on
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B show that our approach significantly enhances both
reasoning performance and response length efficiency. For instance, LASER-D and
its variant achieve a +6.1 improvement on AIME2024 while reducing token usage
by 63%. Further analysis reveals our RL-based compression produces more concise
reasoning patterns with less redundant "self-reflections". Resources are at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学推理中存在多步逻辑执行的挑战，但现有评估仅关注最终答案准确性，无法全面反映模型表现。

Method: 提出MAPLE评分，整合错误率、冗余性和有效性，以量化推理偏差。

Result: MAPLE评分能够更全面地评估大语言模型的数学推理能力。

Conclusion: 新评估框架MAPLE为衡量大语言模型的数学推理能力提供了更全面的视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate considerable potential in various
natural language tasks but face significant challenges in mathematical
reasoning, particularly in executing precise, multi-step logic. However,
current evaluation frameworks judge their performance solely based on accuracy,
which only accounts for the final answer. This study explores these pitfalls by
employing a novel evaluation framework. We propose an evaluation metric called
the MAPLE score, which holistically quantifies reasoning misalignment by
integrating error rates, redundancy, and validity.

Abstract: Large language models that use retrieval augmented generation have the
potential to unlock valuable knowledge for researchers, policymakers, and the
public by making long and technical climate-related documents more accessible.
While this approach can help alleviate factual hallucinations by relying on
retrieved passages as additional context, its effectiveness depends on whether
the model's output remains faithful to these passages. To address this, we
explore the automatic assessment of faithfulness of different models in this
setting. We then focus on ClimateGPT, a large language model specialised in
climate science, to examine which factors in its instruction fine-tuning impact
the model's faithfulness. By excluding unfaithful subsets of the model's
training data, we develop ClimateGPT Faithful+, which achieves an improvement
in faithfulness from 30% to 57% in supported atomic claims according to our
automatic metric.

Motivation: 尽管长链思维（CoT）能提升LLM推理能力，但依赖高质量长CoT数据和微调成本高昂。本文旨在无需外部数据的情况下增强LLM推理能力。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）提取可解释特征引导LLM内部状态；进一步提出无SAE的算法，直接从残差激活计算引导方向。

Result: 实验表明，SAE和无SAE的引导算法均显著提升LLM的推理能力。

Conclusion: 无需外部数据，通过内部状态引导即可有效增强LLM推理能力，为复杂问题提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to solve reasoning and
mathematical problems using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. Expanding CoT
length, as seen in models such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly enhances this
reasoning for complex problems, but requires costly and high-quality long CoT
data and fine-tuning. This work, inspired by the deep thinking paradigm of
DeepSeek-R1, utilizes a steering technique to enhance the reasoning ability of
an LLM without external datasets. Our method first employs Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to extract interpretable features from vanilla CoT. These features are
then used to steer the LLM's internal states during generation. Recognizing
that many LLMs do not have corresponding pre-trained SAEs, we further introduce
a novel SAE-free steering algorithm, which directly computes steering
directions from the residual activations of an LLM, obviating the need for an
explicit SAE. Experimental results demonstrate that both our SAE-based and
subsequent SAE-free steering algorithms significantly enhance the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

Motivation: 准确的词级时间戳对语音内容检索和定时字幕等任务至关重要，传统方法需外部对齐模块，本方法旨在简化流程。

Method: 利用NFA教师模型生成时间戳，引入<|timestamp|>标记训练Canary直接预测词级时间戳。

Result: 在四种语言中，时间戳预测精度达80%-90%，误差20-120毫秒，WER影响小；AST任务中误差约200毫秒。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且准确，适用于多语言和AST任务，显著简化了时间戳预测流程。

Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach for enabling word-level timestamp
prediction in the Canary model. Accurate timestamp information is crucial for a
variety of downstream tasks such as speech content retrieval and timed
subtitles. While traditional hybrid systems and end-to-end (E2E) models may
employ external modules for timestamp prediction, our approach eliminates the
need for separate alignment mechanisms. By leveraging the NeMo Forced Aligner
(NFA) as a teacher model, we generate word-level timestamps and train the
Canary model to predict timestamps directly. We introduce a new <|timestamp|>
token, enabling the Canary model to predict start and end timestamps for each
word. Our method demonstrates precision and recall rates between 80% and 90%,
with timestamp prediction errors ranging from 20 to 120 ms across four
languages, with minimal WER degradation. Additionally, we extend our system to
automatic speech translation (AST) tasks, achieving timestamp prediction errors
around 200 milliseconds.

Motivation: 揭示开源LLM微调过程中潜在的数据泄露风险，提醒社区关注并解决这一问题。

Method: 通过后门训练攻击，仅需黑盒访问微调后的下游模型，即可提取私有数据。实验覆盖4种开源模型和2个数据集。

Conclusion: 开源LLM微调存在严重数据泄露风险，需进一步研究解决。

Abstract: Fine-tuning on open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with proprietary data
is now a standard practice for downstream developers to obtain task-specific
LLMs. Surprisingly, we reveal a new and concerning risk along with the
practice: the creator of the open-source LLMs can later extract the private
downstream fine-tuning data through simple backdoor training, only requiring
black-box access to the fine-tuned downstream model. Our comprehensive
experiments, across 4 popularly used open-source models with 3B to 32B
parameters and 2 downstream datasets, suggest that the extraction performance
can be strikingly high: in practical settings, as much as 76.3% downstream
fine-tuning data (queries) out of a total 5,000 samples can be perfectly
extracted, and the success rate can increase to 94.9% in more ideal settings.
We also explore a detection-based defense strategy but find it can be bypassed
with improved attack. Overall, we highlight the emergency of this newly
identified data breaching risk in fine-tuning, and we hope that more follow-up
research could push the progress of addressing this concerning risk. The code

Motivation: 当前语音语言模型局限于轮转式交互，缺乏实时适应性（如用户打断）。

Method: 采用双工S2S架构，分离用户和代理建模，使用预训练流式编码器，优化编解码器以降低比特率。

Result: 模型在推理、轮转和打断能力上优于现有双工模型，比特率减半（0.6 kbps），且无需语音预训练。

Conclusion: 该模型是首个公开可用的双工S2S模型，显著简化了构建过程，并推动了可复现性。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue is an intuitive form of human-computer interaction, yet
current speech language models often remain constrained to turn-based
exchanges, lacking real-time adaptability such as user barge-in. We propose a
novel duplex speech to speech (S2S) architecture featuring continuous user
inputs and codec agent outputs with channel fusion that directly models
simultaneous user and agent streams. Using a pretrained streaming encoder for
user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech
pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec
fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared
to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in
abilities. The model requires significantly less speech data, as speech
pretrain is skipped, which markedly simplifies the process of building a duplex
S2S model from any LLMs. Finally, it is the first openly available duplex S2S
model with training and inference code to foster reproducibility.

TLDR: UniErase是一种新型的机器学习遗忘范式，通过可学习的参数后缀（遗忘标记）引导语言模型实现定向遗忘，在保持模型能力的同时高效移除敏感信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有遗忘方法在平衡遗忘效果和模型能力上的不足，避免模型崩溃或泛化能力差的问题。

Method: UniErase分为两个阶段：(I) 通过标记优化将遗忘目标绑定到模型的概率分布；(II) 轻量级模型编辑阶段激活标记以诱导遗忘。

Result: 在TOFU基准测试中，UniErase仅修改约3.66%的参数，遗忘效果提升4.01倍，同时模型能力保持更优。

Conclusion: UniErase在遗忘领域实现了双重顶级性能，为语言模型的知识移除提供了高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models require iterative updates to address challenges such as
knowledge conflicts and outdated information (e.g., incorrect, private, or
illegal contents). Machine unlearning provides a systematic methodology for
targeted knowledge removal from trained models, enabling elimination of
sensitive information influences. However, mainstream fine-tuning-based
unlearning methods often fail to balance unlearning efficacy and model ability,
frequently resulting in catastrophic model collapse under extensive knowledge
removal. Meanwhile, in-context unlearning, which relies solely on contextual
prompting without modifying the model's intrinsic mechanisms, suffers from
limited generalizability and struggles to achieve true unlearning. In this
work, we introduce UniErase, a novel unlearning paradigm that employs learnable
parametric suffix (unlearning token) to steer language models toward targeted
forgetting behaviors. UniErase operates through two key phases: (I) an
optimization stage that binds desired unlearning outputs to the model's
autoregressive probability distribution via token optimization, followed by
(II) a lightweight model editing phase that activates the learned token to
probabilistically induce specified forgetting objective. Serving as a new
research direction for token learning to induce unlearning target, UniErase
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across batch, sequential, and
precise unlearning under fictitious and real-world knowledge settings.
Remarkably, in terms of TOFU benchmark, UniErase, modifying only around 3.66%
of the LLM parameters, outperforms previous forgetting SOTA baseline by around
4.01 times for model ability with even better unlearning efficacy. Similarly,
UniErase, maintaining more ability, also surpasses previous retaining SOTA by
35.96% for unlearning efficacy, showing dual top-tier performances in current
unlearing domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解具体性如何在心理和大脑中表示是心理学、神经科学和计算语言学的核心问题。尽管语言模型为语义表示提供了量化工具，但具体性在模型中的表示仍未被充分探索。

Method: 通过行为判断估计人类隐含的语义距离，并使用表征相似性分析（RSA）比较人类与语言模型的语义表示。还通过消融实验验证具体性的作用。

Result: 人类和语言模型的语义表示在具体性维度上显著对齐，且这种对齐主要由具体性驱动，而非其他心理语言学特征。

Conclusion: 人类和语言模型在具体性维度上表现出收敛，但在其他维度上未发现类似一致性，表明具体性是两者语义表示的共同核心。

Abstract: The nouns of our language refer to either concrete entities (like a table) or
abstract concepts (like justice or love), and cognitive psychology has
established that concreteness influences how words are processed. Accordingly,
understanding how concreteness is represented in our mind and brain is a
central question in psychology, neuroscience, and computational linguistics.
While the advent of powerful language models has allowed for quantitative
inquiries into the nature of semantic representations, it remains largely
underexplored how they represent concreteness. Here, we used behavioral
judgments to estimate semantic distances implicitly used by humans, for a set
of carefully selected abstract and concrete nouns. Using Representational
Similarity Analysis, we find that the implicit representational space of
participants and the semantic representations of language models are
significantly aligned. We also find that both representational spaces are
implicitly aligned to an explicit representation of concreteness, which was
obtained from our participants using an additional concreteness rating task.
Importantly, using ablation experiments, we demonstrate that the human-to-model
alignment is substantially driven by concreteness, but not by other important
word characteristics established in psycholinguistics. These results indicate
that humans and language models converge on the concreteness dimension, but not
on other dimensions.

Motivation: 私有数据质量高但分散，传统方法在联邦环境中存在安全、效率和适应性不足的问题。

Method: 采用本地客户端输入/输出块、高斯噪声注入、并行训练策略和动态分割点调整。

Result: 实验显示FL-LLaMA性能接近集中式LLaMA2，训练速度提升2倍，推理速度提升8倍。

Conclusion: FL-LLaMA在安全性、效率和适应性方面表现优异，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Private data is typically larger and of higher quality than public data,
offering great potential to improve LLM. However, its scattered distribution
across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their
deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based
split learning model has emerged, offloading most model parameters to the
server while retaining only the embedding and output layers on clients to
ensure privacy. However, it still faces significant challenges in security,
efficiency, and adaptability: 1) embedding gradients are vulnerable to attacks,
leading to reverse engineering of private data; 2) the autoregressive nature of
LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially,
causing high communication overhead; 3) fixed partition points lack
adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FL-LLaMA, a
secure, efficient, and adaptive federated split framework based on LLaMA2.
First, we place some input and output blocks on the local client and inject
Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states, enabling secure end-to-end
propagation. Second, we employ client-batch and server-hierarchical strategies
to achieve parallel training, along with attention-mask compression and KV
cache mechanisms to accelerate inference, reducing communication costs
effectively. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points
for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements and hardware
limitations. Experiments on NLU, summarization and conversational QA tasks show
that FL-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2, and
achieves up to 2x train speedups and 8x inference speedups. Further analysis of
privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the
effectiveness of FL-LLaMA in security and adaptability.

Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示中推理标记过长导致的延迟、内存消耗和上下文截断问题。

Method: 插入终止标记提前结束推理，利用注意力机制分析，并通过轻量级后调节机制保持答案格式。

Result: 在不微调或额外数据的情况下，ThinkLess达到与完整CoT解码相当的准确性，显著减少解码时间和内存消耗。

Conclusion: ThinkLess是一种高效推理框架，通过优化推理生成过程提升性能。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), the excessive length of reasoning tokens increases latency and
KV cache memory usage, and may even truncate final answers under context
limits. We propose ThinkLess, an inference-efficient framework that terminates
reasoning generation early and maintains output quality without modifying the
model. Atttention analysis reveals that answer tokens focus minimally on
earlier reasoning steps and primarily attend to the reasoning terminator token,
due to information migration under causal masking. Building on this insight,
ThinkLess inserts the terminator token at earlier positions to skip redundant
reasoning while preserving the underlying knowledge transfer. To prevent format
discruption casued by early termination, ThinkLess employs a lightweight
post-regulation mechanism, relying on the model's natural instruction-following
ability to produce well-structured answers. Without fine-tuning or auxiliary
data, ThinkLess achieves comparable accuracy to full-length CoT decoding while
greatly reducing decoding time and memory consumption.

Method: 提出TAPO框架，通过自适应整合结构化思维模式，平衡内部探索与外部指导利用。

Result: 在AIME、AMC和Minerva Math任务上分别超越GRPO 99%、41%和17%。

Conclusion: TAPO展示了在多任务和多领域中广泛应用的潜力，并提升了模型的可解释性和输出可读性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective method for training
reasoning models. However, existing RL approaches typically bias the model's
output distribution toward reward-maximizing paths without introducing external
knowledge. This limits their exploration capacity and results in a narrower
reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. To address this
limitation, we propose TAPO (Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization), a novel
framework that augments RL by incorporating external high-level guidance
("thought patterns"). By adaptively integrating structured thoughts during
training, TAPO effectively balances model-internal exploration and external
guidance exploitation. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly outperforms GRPO by 99% on AIME, 41% on AMC, and 17% on Minerva
Math. Notably, these high-level thought patterns, abstracted from only 500
prior samples, generalize effectively across various tasks and models. This
highlights TAPO's potential for broader applications across multiple tasks and
domains. Our further analysis reveals that introducing external guidance
produces powerful reasoning models with superior explainability of inference
behavior and enhanced output readability.

Abstract: The surge of user-generated online content presents a wealth of insights into

traditional opinion mining approaches. To address this, we introduce Online
Opinion Mining Benchmark (OOMB), a novel dataset and evaluation protocol
designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to mine opinions
effectively from diverse and intricate online environments. OOMB provides
extensive (entity, feature, opinion) tuple annotations and a comprehensive
opinion-centric summary that highlights key opinion topics within each content,
thereby enabling the evaluation of both the extractive and abstractive
capabilities of models. Through our proposed benchmark, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of which aspects remain challenging and where LLMs
exhibit adaptability, to explore whether they can effectively serve as opinion
miners in realistic online scenarios. This study lays the foundation for

Motivation: BERT的[CLS]表示在分类任务中常用，但其他token和中间层也包含有价值的信息，现有方法未充分利用。

Method: 提出MaxPoolBERT，包括三种改进：(i)跨层对[CLS]进行最大池化，(ii)通过额外MHA层让[CLS]关注最终层，(iii)结合全序列最大池化和MHA。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中，MaxPoolBERT性能优于标准BERT-base模型，尤其在低资源任务中。

Conclusion: MaxPoolBERT无需预训练或显著增加模型大小，即可提升BERT的分类准确性。

Abstract: The [CLS] token in BERT is commonly used as a fixed-length representation for
classification tasks, yet prior work has shown that both other tokens and
intermediate layers encode valuable contextual information. In this work, we
propose MaxPoolBERT, a lightweight extension to BERT that refines the [CLS]
representation by aggregating information across layers and tokens.
Specifically, we explore three modifications: (i) max-pooling the [CLS] token
across multiple layers, (ii) enabling the [CLS] token to attend over the entire
final layer using an additional multi-head attention (MHA) layer, and (iii)
combining max-pooling across the full sequence with MHA. Our approach enhances
BERT's classification accuracy (especially on low-resource tasks) without
requiring pre-training or significantly increasing model size. Experiments on
the GLUE benchmark show that MaxPoolBERT consistently achieves a better
performance on the standard BERT-base model.

understanding (SLU), focusing on four datasets spanning four languages. We
address the unlearning of data from specific speakers as a way to evaluate the
quality of potential "right to be forgotten" requests. We assess eight
unlearning techniques and propose a novel metric to simultaneously better
capture their efficacy, utility, and efficiency. UnSLU-BENCH sets a foundation
for unlearning in SLU and reveals significant differences in the effectiveness
and computational feasibility of various techniques.

*Peng Wang,Biyu Zhou,Xuehai Tang,Jizhong Han,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: LyapLock是一个基于约束随机规划和Lyapunov优化的模型编辑框架，旨在解决大语言模型在顺序编辑中的长期知识保存问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型常包含错误或过时的知识，而现有的定位-编辑方法在顺序编辑中性能逐渐下降，缺乏长期知识保存机制。

Method: 将顺序编辑建模为约束随机规划问题，结合排队论和Lyapunov优化，分解为可处理的子问题。

Result: 实验表明，LyapLock支持超过10,000次编辑，稳定通用能力，编辑效率比现有方法提升11.89%。

Conclusion: LyapLock是首个具有理论保证的模型编辑框架，显著提升了顺序编辑的长期性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models often contain factually incorrect or outdated
knowledge, giving rise to model editing methods for precise knowledge updates.
However, current mainstream locate-then-edit approaches exhibit a progressive
performance decline during sequential editing, due to inadequate mechanisms for
long-term knowledge preservation. To tackle this, we model the sequential
editing as a constrained stochastic programming. Given the challenges posed by
the cumulative preservation error constraint and the gradually revealed editing
tasks, \textbf{LyapLock} is proposed. It integrates queuing theory and Lyapunov
optimization to decompose the long-term constrained programming into tractable
stepwise subproblems for efficient solving. This is the first model editing
framework with rigorous theoretical guarantees, achieving asymptotic optimal
editing performance while meeting the constraints of long-term knowledge
preservation. Experimental results show that our framework scales sequential
editing capacity to over 10,000 edits while stabilizing general capabilities
and boosting average editing efficacy by 11.89\% over SOTA baselines.
Furthermore, it can be leveraged to enhance the performance of baseline
methods. Our code is released on https://github.com/caskcsg/LyapLock.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于模型内部表示的安全评估方法SRR，通过轻量级相似性评分器对候选响应进行排序，显著提升了对抗性提示的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全评估方法仅关注文本响应，忽略了模型内部表示中的丰富信息，导致潜在的安全隐患。

Method: 提出Safety Representation Ranking (SRR)，利用LLM的隐藏状态对指令和候选完成进行编码，并通过相似性评分器排序候选响应。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SRR显著提升了对对抗性提示的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SRR通过利用模型内部表示和列表级监督，有效捕捉了细微的安全信号，为LLM安全评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated
milestone success in a variety of tasks, yet their potential for generating
harmful content has raised significant safety concerns. Existing safety
evaluation approaches typically operate directly on textual responses,
overlooking the rich information embedded in the model's internal
representations. In this paper, we propose Safety Representation Ranking (SRR),
a listwise ranking framework that selects safe responses using hidden states
from the LLM itself. SRR encodes both instructions and candidate completions
using intermediate transformer representations and ranks candidates via a
lightweight similarity-based scorer. Our approach directly leverages internal
model states and supervision at the list level to capture subtle safety
signals. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SRR significantly
improves robustness to adversarial prompts. Our code will be available upon
publication.

Result: 发现广泛思考和Chain-of-Thought提示等策略的局限性，并探讨语境大小、推理步骤和答案空间对性能的影响。

Conclusion: TurnaboutLLM为LLMs在复杂叙事环境中的演绎推理能力提出了重大挑战。

Abstract: This paper introduces TurnaboutLLM, a novel framework and dataset for
evaluating the deductive reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
leveraging the interactive gameplay of detective games Ace Attorney and
Danganronpa. The framework tasks LLMs with identifying contradictions between
testimonies and evidences within long narrative contexts, a challenging task
due to the large answer space and diverse reasoning types presented by its
questions. We evaluate twelve state-of-the-art LLMs on the dataset, hinting at
limitations of popular strategies for enhancing deductive reasoning such as
extensive thinking and Chain-of-Thought prompting. The results also suggest
varying effects of context size, the number of reasoning step and answer space
size on model performance. Overall, TurnaboutLLM presents a substantial
challenge for LLMs' deductive reasoning abilities in complex, narrative-rich
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的心理健康支持方法缺乏临床基础，特别是在诊断推理和多治疗模式整合方面。

Method: 提出自动化数据合成管道，处理真实心理健康帖子，生成多轮对话结构，并利用国际诊断标准和多种治疗框架指导LLM生成临床推理数据。

Result: PsyLLM在多维度评估（全面性、专业性、真实性和安全性）中显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: PsyLLM为心理健康咨询提供了更系统、临床化的解决方案，填补了现有LLM方法的不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold significant potential for mental health
support, capable of generating empathetic responses and simulating therapeutic
conversations. However, existing LLM-based approaches often lack the clinical
grounding necessary for real-world psychological counseling, particularly in
explicit diagnostic reasoning aligned with standards like the DSM/ICD and
incorporating diverse therapeutic modalities beyond basic empathy or single
strategies. To address these critical limitations, we propose PsyLLM, the first
large language model designed to systematically integrate both diagnostic and
therapeutic reasoning for mental health counseling. To develop the PsyLLM, we
propose a novel automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline processes
real-world mental health posts, generates multi-turn dialogue structures, and
leverages LLMs guided by international diagnostic standards (e.g., DSM/ICD) and
multiple therapeutic frameworks (e.g., CBT, ACT, psychodynamic) to simulate
detailed clinical reasoning processes. Rigorous multi-dimensional filtering
ensures the generation of high-quality, clinically aligned dialogue data. In
addition, we introduce a new benchmark and evaluation protocol, assessing
counseling quality across four key dimensions: comprehensiveness,
professionalism, authenticity, and safety. Our experiments demonstrate that
PsyLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models on this
benchmark.

TLDR: 该研究首次全面分析了多语言大语言模型（MLLMs）中的记忆现象，提出了一种基于语言相似性的图相关度量方法，揭示了跨语言记忆模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLLMs的广泛应用，理解其记忆行为变得至关重要，但现有研究主要关注单语模型，多语言记忆研究不足。

Method: 研究分析了95种语言，使用不同规模、架构和记忆定义的模型，并提出了一种基于语言相似性的图相关度量方法。

Result: 研究发现，语言相似性显著影响记忆模式，训练数据较少的相似语言表现出更高的记忆性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了语言相似性在评估和缓解MLLMs记忆漏洞中的重要性，并为跨语言可迁移性提供了实证依据。

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of Memorization in Multilingual
Large Language Models (MLLMs), analyzing 95 languages using models across
diverse model scales, architectures, and memorization definitions. As MLLMs are
increasingly deployed, understanding their memorization behavior has become
critical. Yet prior work has focused primarily on monolingual models, leaving
multilingual memorization underexplored, despite the inherently long-tailed
nature of training corpora. We find that the prevailing assumption, that
memorization is highly correlated with training data availability, fails to
fully explain memorization patterns in MLLMs. We hypothesize that treating
languages in isolation - ignoring their similarities - obscures the true
patterns of memorization. To address this, we propose a novel graph-based
correlation metric that incorporates language similarity to analyze
cross-lingual memorization. Our analysis reveals that among similar languages,
those with fewer training tokens tend to exhibit higher memorization, a trend
that only emerges when cross-lingual relationships are explicitly modeled.
These findings underscore the importance of a language-aware perspective in
evaluating and mitigating memorization vulnerabilities in MLLMs. This also
constitutes empirical evidence that language similarity both explains
Memorization in MLLMs and underpins Cross-lingual Transferability, with broad
implications for multilingual NLP.

Result: 实验结果显示当前模型能力差异显著，各有优劣，为未来语音交互系统研究提供指导。

Conclusion: VocalBench为语音交互模型提供了全面评估工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并推动未来研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the
development of multi-modal models capable of vocal communication. Unlike
text-based interactions, speech conveys rich and diverse information, including
semantic content, acoustic variations, paralanguage cues, and environmental
context. However, existing evaluations of speech interaction models
predominantly focus on the quality of their textual responses, often
overlooking critical aspects of vocal performance and lacking benchmarks with
vocal-specific test instances. To address this gap, we propose VocalBench, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate speech interaction models'
capabilities in vocal communication. VocalBench comprises 9,400 carefully
curated instances across four key dimensions: semantic quality, acoustic
performance, conversational abilities, and robustness. It covers 16 fundamental
skills essential for effective vocal interaction. Experimental results reveal
significant variability in current model capabilities, each exhibiting distinct
strengths and weaknesses, and provide valuable insights to guide future
research in speech-based interaction systems. Code and evaluation instances are

Motivation: 当前大语言模型依赖大量数据提升推理能力，但这种方法逐渐变得不切实际，需要模型能够自主提升推理能力。

Method: 提出DTE框架，利用多智能体辩论痕迹训练单一语言模型，并引入Reflect-Critique-Refine提示策略优化辩论质量。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，DTE框架平均准确率提升8.92%（GSM-PLUS数据集），并展现出跨领域泛化能力（平均提升5.8%）。

Conclusion: DTE框架能有效提升语言模型的推理能力，且具备通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have improved significantly in their reasoning
through extensive training on massive datasets. However, relying solely on
additional data for improvement is becoming increasingly impractical,
highlighting the need for models to autonomously enhance their reasoning
without external supervision. In this paper, we propose Debate, Train, Evolve
(DTE), a novel ground truth-free training framework that uses multi-agent
debate traces to evolve a single language model. We also introduce a new
prompting strategy Reflect-Critique-Refine, to improve debate quality by
explicitly instructing agents to critique and refine their reasoning. Extensive
evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks with six open-weight models show that
our DTE framework achieve substantial improvements, with an average accuracy
gain of 8.92% on the challenging GSM-PLUS dataset. Furthermore, we observe
strong cross-domain generalization, with an average accuracy gain of 5.8% on
all other benchmarks, suggesting that our method captures general reasoning
capabilities.

TLDR: HyCo$_2$是一种混合上下文压缩方法，结合全局和局部视角优化LLM的长序列推理效率，显著减少令牌使用并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在长序列推理中的计算低效和冗余处理问题，避免现有方法因忽略文本内容分布不均和用户需求多样性而导致的信息丢失。

Method: 提出HyCo$_2$，通过混合适配器优化全局语义，结合分类层基于局部视角决定令牌保留概率，并通过辅助预训练平衡全局与局部压缩。

Result: 在七个知识密集型QA基准测试中平均提升13.1%性能，同时减少88.8%的令牌消耗。

Conclusion: HyCo$_2$有效平衡全局与局部信息保留，显著提升长文本推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges in
long-sequence inference due to computational inefficiency and redundant
processing, driving interest in context compression techniques. Existing
methods often rely on token importance to perform hard local compression or
encode context into latent representations for soft global compression.
However, the uneven distribution of textual content relevance and the diversity
of demands for user instructions mean these approaches frequently lead to the
loss of potentially valuable information. To address this, we propose
$\textbf{Hy}$brid $\textbf{Co}$ntext $\textbf{Co}$mpression (HyCo$_2$) for
LLMs, which integrates both global and local perspectives to guide context
compression while retaining both the essential semantics and critical details
for task completion. Specifically, we employ a hybrid adapter to refine global
semantics with the global view, based on the observation that different
adapters excel at different tasks. Then we incorporate a classification layer
that assigns a retention probability to each context token based on the local
view, determining whether it should be retained or discarded. To foster a
balanced integration of global and local compression, we introduce auxiliary
paraphrasing and completion pretraining before instruction tuning. This
promotes a synergistic integration that emphasizes instruction-relevant
information while preserving essential local details, ultimately balancing
local and global information retention in context compression. Experiments show
that our HyCo$_2$ method significantly enhances long-text reasoning while
reducing token usage. It improves the performance of various LLM series by an
average of 13.1\% across seven knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks. Moreover,
HyCo$_2$ matches the performance of uncompressed methods while reducing token
consumption by 88.8\%.

TLDR: ConvSearch-R1是一个自驱动的对话查询重构框架，通过强化学习直接优化检索信号，无需外部监督，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有对话查询重构方法对外部监督的高依赖性和与下游检索器对齐不足的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：自驱动策略预热和检索引导的强化学习，结合排名激励奖励机制。

Result: 在TopiOCQA和QReCC数据集上表现优异，TopiOCQA上提升超过10%。

Conclusion: ConvSearch-R1通过自驱动框架有效解决了对话查询重构的挑战，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Conversational search systems require effective handling of context-dependent
queries that often contain ambiguity, omission, and coreference. Conversational
Query Reformulation (CQR) addresses this challenge by transforming these
queries into self-contained forms suitable for off-the-shelf retrievers.
However, existing CQR approaches suffer from two critical constraints: high
dependency on costly external supervision from human annotations or large
language models, and insufficient alignment between the rewriting model and
downstream retrievers. We present ConvSearch-R1, the first self-driven
framework that completely eliminates dependency on external rewrite supervision
by leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize reformulation directly through
retrieval signals. Our novel two-stage approach combines Self-Driven Policy
Warm-Up to address the cold-start problem through retrieval-guided
self-distillation, followed by Retrieval-Guided Reinforcement Learning with a
specially designed rank-incentive reward shaping mechanism that addresses the
sparsity issue in conventional retrieval metrics. Extensive experiments on
TopiOCQA and QReCC datasets demonstrate that ConvSearch-R1 significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 10% improvement
on the challenging TopiOCQA dataset while using smaller 3B parameter models
without any external supervision.

Motivation: 当前推理模型受限于离散语言令牌，无法充分探索推理路径，限制了表达能力。Soft Thinking旨在通过连续概念空间实现更流畅、丰富的推理。

Method: 利用概率加权的令牌嵌入混合生成抽象概念令牌，形成连续概念空间，支持平滑过渡和多路径推理。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，Soft Thinking显著提高了推理准确率（最高提升2.48分）并减少了令牌使用（最高减少22.4%）。

Conclusion: Soft Thinking突破了离散语言推理的瓶颈，提供了一种高效且可解释的推理方法。

Abstract: Human cognition typically involves thinking through abstract, fluid concepts
rather than strictly using discrete linguistic tokens. Current reasoning
models, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human
language, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in
the semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and
upper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration
of reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling
one token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free
method that emulates human-like "soft" reasoning by generating soft, abstract
concept tokens in a continuous concept space. These concept tokens are created
by the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the
continuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer
representations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence,
each generated concept token encapsulates multiple meanings from related
discrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge
effectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse
mathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness
and efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points
while simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard
CoT. Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain
highly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking
to break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning. Code is

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为延迟KV-Cache的机制，用于加速扩散语言模型（DLMs）的推理过程，解决了其非自回归架构和双向注意力导致的推理速度慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型（DLMs）因非自回归架构和双向注意力而推理速度慢，缺乏类似自回归模型中的键值缓存（KV-Cache）机制。本文旨在解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 提出延迟KV-Cache机制，包括两种变体：dKV-Cache-Decode（几乎无损加速）和dKV-Cache-Greedy（更高速度但性能略有下降）。

Result: 实验表明，延迟KV-Cache实现了2-10倍的推理加速，并在多个基准测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: 延迟KV-Cache显著缩小了自回归模型与扩散语言模型之间的推理速度差距，且无需额外训练即可应用于现有DLMs。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have been seen as a promising competitor for
autoregressive language models. However, diffusion language models have long
been constrained by slow inference. A core challenge is that their
non-autoregressive architecture and bidirectional attention preclude the
key-value cache that accelerates decoding. We address this bottleneck by
proposing a KV-cache-like mechanism, delayed KV-Cache, for the denoising
process of DLMs. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different
tokens have distinct representation dynamics throughout the diffusion process.
Accordingly, we propose a delayed and conditioned caching strategy for key and
value states. We design two complementary variants to cache key and value
step-by-step: (1) dKV-Cache-Decode, which provides almost lossless
acceleration, and even improves performance on long sequences, suggesting that
existing DLMs may under-utilise contextual information during inference. (2)
dKV-Cache-Greedy, which has aggressive caching with reduced lifespan, achieving
higher speed-ups with quadratic time complexity at the cost of some performance
degradation. dKV-Cache, in final, achieves from 2-10x speedup in inference,
largely narrowing the gap between ARs and DLMs. We evaluate our dKV-Cache on
several benchmarks, delivering acceleration across general language
understanding, mathematical, and code-generation benchmarks. Experiments
demonstrate that cache can also be used in DLMs, even in a training-free manner
from current DLMs.

Motivation: 现有细粒度评估方法（如FactScore）虽能验证单个事实，但忽略了事实间的依赖关系，导致对欺骗性叙述的评估存在漏洞。

Method: 提出MontageLie基准，通过拼接真实陈述构建欺骗性叙述；提出DoveScore框架，联合验证事实准确性和事件顺序一致性。

Result: 实验显示，现有评估方法对MontageLie攻击的AUC-ROC低于65%，而DoveScore优于现有方法8%以上。

Conclusion: DoveScore通过建模事实间关系，显著提升了长文本对齐评估的鲁棒性，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Information alignment evaluators are vital for various NLG evaluation tasks
and trustworthy LLM deployment, reducing hallucinations and enhancing user
trust. Current fine-grained methods, like FactScore, verify facts individually
but neglect inter-fact dependencies, enabling subtle vulnerabilities. In this
work, we introduce MontageLie, a challenging benchmark that constructs
deceptive narratives by "montaging" truthful statements without introducing
explicit hallucinations. We demonstrate that both coarse-grained LLM-based
evaluators and current fine-grained frameworks are susceptible to this attack,
with AUC-ROC scores falling below 65%. To enable more robust fine-grained
evaluation, we propose DoveScore, a novel framework that jointly verifies
factual accuracy and event-order consistency. By modeling inter-fact
relationships, DoveScore outperforms existing fine-grained methods by over 8%,
providing a more robust solution for long-form text alignment evaluation. Our
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/dannalily/DoveScore.

Result: 优化后的前导生成器显著提升评分，且效果可迁移至未训练的模型。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了LLM评估的潜在漏洞，并为未来任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely evaluated by
other LLMs trained to predict human preferences. This framework--known as
LLM-as-a-judge--is highly scalable and relatively low cost. However, it is also
vulnerable to malicious exploitation, as LLM responses can be tuned to overfit
the preferences of the judge. Previous work shows that the answers generated by
a candidate-LLM can be edited post hoc to maximise the score assigned to them
by a judge-LLM. In this study, we adopt a different approach and use the signal
provided by judge-LLMs as a reward to adversarially tune models that generate
text preambles designed to boost downstream performance. We find that frozen
LLMs pipelined with these models attain higher LLM-evaluation scores than
existing frameworks. Crucially, unlike other frameworks which intervene
directly on the model's response, our method is virtually undetectable. We also
demonstrate that the effectiveness of the tuned preamble generator transfers
when the candidate-LLM and the judge-LLM are replaced with models that are not
used during training. These findings raise important questions about the design
of more reliable LLM-as-a-judge evaluation settings. They also demonstrate that
human preferences can be reverse engineered effectively, by pipelining LLMs to
optimise upstream preambles via reinforcement learning--an approach that could
find future applications in diverse tasks and domains beyond adversarial
attacks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved
remarkable performance in the domain of reasoning. A key component of their
training is the incorporation of verifiable rewards within reinforcement
learning (RL). However, existing reward benchmarks do not evaluate
reference-based reward systems, leaving researchers with limited understanding
of the accuracy of verifiers used in RL. In this paper, we introduce two
benchmarks, VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, designed to assess the
performance of reference-based reward systems. These benchmarks are constructed
through meticulous data collection and curation, followed by careful human
annotation to ensure high quality. Current models still show considerable room
for improvement on both VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, especially
smaller-scale models. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough and comprehensive
analysis of evaluation results, offering insights for understanding and
developing reference-based reward systems. Our proposed benchmarks serve as
effective tools for guiding the development of verifier accuracy and the

### [135] [Keep Security! Benchmarking Security Policy Preservation in Large Language Model Contexts Against Indirect Attacks in Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15805)
*Hwan Chang,Yumin Kim,Yonghyun Jun,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一个名为CoPriva的大规模基准数据集，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在问答任务中是否遵守上下文非披露政策，揭示了当前模型在敏感信息泄露方面的严重漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在企业和政府等敏感领域的广泛应用，确保其在上下文中遵守用户定义的安全政策（尤其是信息非披露）变得至关重要，但目前缺乏针对上下文安全保护的基准。

Method: 研究团队开发了CoPriva数据集，包含现实场景中的明确政策和查询，设计为直接和间接攻击以测试模型。评估了10个LLM的表现。

Result: 研究发现许多模型会违反政策并泄露敏感信息，尤其是面对间接攻击时。模型在生成答案时难以整合政策约束，但部分模型在被明确提示时可以修正输出。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在上下文安全对齐方面存在严重不足，亟需更鲁棒的方法来保障敏感应用中的安全性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
domains such as enterprise and government, ensuring that they adhere to
user-defined security policies within context is critical-especially with
respect to information non-disclosure. While prior LLM studies have focused on
general safety and socially sensitive data, large-scale benchmarks for
contextual security preservation against attacks remain lacking. To address
this, we introduce a novel large-scale benchmark dataset, CoPriva, evaluating
LLM adherence to contextual non-disclosure policies in question answering.
Derived from realistic contexts, our dataset includes explicit policies and
queries designed as direct and challenging indirect attacks seeking prohibited
information. We evaluate 10 LLMs on our benchmark and reveal a significant
vulnerability: many models violate user-defined policies and leak sensitive
information. This failure is particularly severe against indirect attacks,
highlighting a critical gap in current LLM safety alignment for sensitive
applications. Our analysis reveals that while models can often identify the
correct answer to a query, they struggle to incorporate policy constraints
during generation. In contrast, they exhibit a partial ability to revise
outputs when explicitly prompted. Our findings underscore the urgent need for
more robust methods to guarantee contextual security.

TLDR: 论文研究了大型语言模型如何通过检索增强实现上下文学习，揭示了其内部机制，并提出了一种基于归因的方法来识别特定注意力头的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索检索增强在上下文学习中的内部机制，以提高语言模型的安全性和透明度。

Method: 提出基于归因的方法，识别并分析专门化的注意力头（上下文头和参数头），提取功能向量并修改其注意力权重。

Result: 揭示了上下文头和参数头在答案生成过程中的作用，并追踪了推理过程中知识的来源。

Conclusion: 研究为更安全和透明的语言模型提供了理论基础和方法支持。

Abstract: Large language models are able to exploit in-context learning to access
external knowledge beyond their training data through retrieval-augmentation.
While promising, its inner workings remain unclear. In this work, we shed light
on the mechanism of in-context retrieval augmentation for question answering by
viewing a prompt as a composition of informational components. We propose an
attribution-based method to identify specialized attention heads, revealing
in-context heads that comprehend instructions and retrieve relevant contextual
information, and parametric heads that store entities' relational knowledge. To
better understand their roles, we extract function vectors and modify their
attention weights to show how they can influence the answer generation process.
Finally, we leverage the gained insights to trace the sources of knowledge used
during inference, paving the way towards more safe and transparent language
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文分析了GUI代理训练中的三个关键问题（输入设计、输出评估、策略更新），并提出针对性解决方案，最终在GUI任务中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理在盲目应用通用RL时面临输入设计、输出评估和策略更新的挑战，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出Fast Thinking模板、带约束的奖励函数和修订的RL目标，优化训练流程。

Result: GUI-G1-3B在ScreenSpot和ScreenSpot-Pro上分别达到90.3%和37.1%的准确率，超越同类模型。

Conclusion: 通过针对性改进，GUI代理在任务中实现了新的最优性能。

Abstract: Recent Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents replicate the R1-Zero paradigm,
coupling online Reinforcement Learning (RL) with explicit chain-of-thought
reasoning prior to object grounding and thereby achieving substantial
performance gains. In this paper, we first conduct extensive analysis
experiments of three key components of that training pipeline: input design,
output evaluation, and policy update-each revealing distinct challenges arising
from blindly applying general-purpose RL without adapting to GUI grounding
tasks. Input design: Current templates encourage the model to generate
chain-of-thought reasoning, but longer chains unexpectedly lead to worse
grounding performance. Output evaluation: Reward functions based on hit signals
or box area allow models to exploit box size, leading to reward hacking and
poor localization quality. Policy update: Online RL tends to overfit easy
examples due to biases in length and sample difficulty, leading to
under-optimization on harder cases. To address these issues, we propose three
targeted solutions. First, we adopt a Fast Thinking Template that encourages
direct answer generation, reducing excessive reasoning during training. Second,
we incorporate a box size constraint into the reward function to mitigate
reward hacking. Third, we revise the RL objective by adjusting length
normalization and adding a difficulty-aware scaling factor, enabling better
optimization on hard samples. Our GUI-G1-3B, trained on 17K public samples with
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, achieves 90.3% accuracy on ScreenSpot and 37.1% on
ScreenSpot-Pro. This surpasses all prior models of similar size and even
outperforms the larger UI-TARS-7B, establishing a new state-of-the-art in GUI
agent grounding. The project repository is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了Mixture-of-Thought (MoT)框架，通过结合自然语言、代码和符号逻辑（真值表）三种推理模态，显著提升了LLM在逻辑推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类使用多种推理模态解决问题，而现有LLM方法通常仅依赖单一模态（如自然语言），限制了模态间的协同作用。

Method: MoT采用两阶段设计：1）自演化的多模态训练；2）推理时充分利用三种模态的协同效应。

Result: 在FOLIO和ProofWriter等逻辑推理基准测试中，MoT比单模态方法平均准确率提升高达11.7个百分点。

Conclusion: MoT框架在训练和推理阶段均有效，尤其适用于复杂逻辑问题，且不同模态互补性强，真值表推理能克服自然语言推理的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Human beings naturally utilize multiple reasoning modalities to learn and
solve logical problems, i.e., different representational formats such as
natural language, code, and symbolic logic. In contrast, most existing
LLM-based approaches operate with a single reasoning modality during training,
typically natural language. Although some methods explored modality selection
or augmentation at inference time, the training process remains modality-blind,
limiting synergy among modalities. To fill in this gap, we propose
Mixture-of-Thought (MoT), a framework that enables LLMs to reason across three
complementary modalities: natural language, code, and a newly introduced
symbolic modality, truth-table, which systematically enumerates logical cases
and partially mitigates key failure modes in natural language reasoning. MoT
adopts a two-phase design: (1) self-evolving MoT training, which jointly learns
from filtered, self-generated rationales across modalities; and (2) MoT
inference, which fully leverages the synergy of three modalities to produce
better predictions. Experiments on logical reasoning benchmarks including FOLIO
and ProofWriter demonstrate that our MoT framework consistently and
significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines with single-modality
chain-of-thought approaches, achieving up to +11.7pp average accuracy gain.
Further analyses show that our MoT framework benefits both training and
inference stages; that it is particularly effective on harder logical reasoning
problems; and that different modalities contribute complementary strengths,
with truth-table reasoning helping to overcome key bottlenecks in natural
language inference.

TLDR: 提出DraftAttention框架，通过动态稀疏注意力加速视频扩散变换器，降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散变换器（DiTs）计算成本高，注意力机制占80%延迟，生成视频耗时严重，影响实际应用。

Method: 提出DraftAttention，在压缩潜在空间中对特征图降采样，生成低分辨率注意力图，指导全分辨率稀疏注意力计算。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在视频生成质量上优于现有稀疏注意力方法，GPU端到端加速达1.75倍。

Conclusion: DraftAttention有效降低计算成本，提升视频生成效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion transformer-based video generation models (DiTs) have recently
attracted widespread attention for their excellent generation quality. However,
their computational cost remains a major bottleneck-attention alone accounts
for over 80% of total latency, and generating just 8 seconds of 720p video
takes tens of minutes-posing serious challenges to practical application and
scalability. To address this, we propose the DraftAttention, a training-free
framework for the acceleration of video diffusion transformers with dynamic
sparse attention on GPUs. We apply down-sampling to each feature map across
frames in the compressed latent space, enabling a higher-level receptive field
over the latent composed of hundreds of thousands of tokens. The low-resolution
draft attention map, derived from draft query and key, exposes redundancy both
spatially within each feature map and temporally across frames. We reorder the
query, key, and value based on the draft attention map to guide the sparse
attention computation in full resolution, and subsequently restore their
original order after the attention computation. This reordering enables
structured sparsity that aligns with hardware-optimized execution. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the low-resolution draft attention
closely approximates the full attention, providing reliable guidance for
constructing accurate sparse attention. Experimental results show that our
method outperforms existing sparse attention approaches in video generation
quality and achieves up to 1.75x end-to-end speedup on GPUs. Code:

TLDR: FastCar框架通过利用时间冗余加速自回归视频生成的解码阶段，提出Temporal Attention Score（TAS）以减少冗余计算，并结合硬件加速器实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在视频生成中因解码阶段的高延迟和MLP模块的冗余计算效率低下，需要优化。

Method: 提出FastCar框架，利用TAS决定是否重用前一帧的MLP输出以减少计算，并开发基于FPGA的硬件加速器。

Result: 实验显示FastCar比传统稀疏注意力方法快2.1倍，能效更高，且在高分辨率和长视频生成中表现优异。

Conclusion: FastCar通过时间冗余优化和硬件加速，显著提升视频生成效率，为实际应用提供优势。

Abstract: Auto-regressive (AR) models, initially successful in language generation,
have recently shown promise in visual generation tasks due to their superior
sampling efficiency. Unlike image generation, video generation requires a
substantially larger number of tokens to produce coherent temporal frames,
resulting in significant overhead during the decoding phase. Our key
observations are: (i) MLP modules in the decode phase dominate the inference
latency, and (ii) there exists high temporal redundancy in MLP outputs of
adjacent frames. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{FastCar} framework to
accelerate the decode phase for the AR video generation by exploring the
temporal redundancy. The Temporal Attention Score (TAS) is proposed to
determine whether to apply the replay strategy (\textit{i.e.}, reusing cached
MLP outputs from the previous frame to reduce redundant computations) with
detailed theoretical analysis and justification. Also, we develop a hardware
accelerator on FPGA with Dynamic Resource Scheduling (DRS) based on TAS to
enable better resource utilization and faster inference. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms traditional
sparse attention approaches with more than 2.1x decoding speedup and higher
energy efficiency on the edge. Furthermore, by combining FastCar and sparse
attention, FastCar can boost the performance of sparse attention with
alleviated drifting, demonstrating our unique advantages for high-resolution
and long-duration video generation. Code:

Motivation: 现有方法忽视局部对象细节和外部知识，导致假新闻检测效果受限。

Result: 模型性能优于现有方法，验证了邻居选择机制和多模态融合的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出知识驱动的多模态推理新范式，从特征融合转向语义验证，代码已开源。

Abstract: Fake news detection remains a challenging problem due to the complex
interplay between textual misinformation, manipulated images, and external
knowledge reasoning. While existing approaches have achieved notable results in
verifying veracity and cross-modal consistency, two key challenges persist: (1)
Existing methods often consider only the global image context while neglecting
local object-level details, and (2) they fail to incorporate external knowledge
and entity relationships for deeper semantic understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal fake news detection framework that
integrates visual, textual, and knowledge-based representations. Our approach
leverages bottom-up attention to capture fine-grained object details, CLIP for
global image semantics, and RoBERTa for context-aware text encoding. We further
enhance knowledge utilization by retrieving and adaptively selecting relevant
entities from a knowledge graph. The fused multi-modal features are processed
through a Transformer-based classifier to predict news veracity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model outperforms recent approaches, showcasing
the effectiveness of neighbor selection mechanism and multi-modal fusion for
fake news detection. Our proposal introduces a new paradigm: knowledge-grounded
multimodal reasoning. By integrating explicit entity-level selection and
NLI-guided filtering, we shift fake news detection from feature fusion to
semantically grounded verification. For reproducibility and further research,

Motivation: 传统语义分割模型在工业图像检测中因缺乏对物体轮廓的感知，难以保持固定组件在不同环境下的分割一致性，且需满足实时性和低计算复杂度要求。

Method: 提出SPENet，通过分别监督边界和主体信息提取，并引入VBD方法描述模糊边界，同时提出CMSE指标衡量分割一致性。

Result: 在数据集上取得最佳分割精度和竞争性速度，CMSE指标较之前最优模型降低50%以上。

Conclusion: SPENet在工业图像检测中显著提升分割一致性和效率，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation stands as a pivotal research focus in computer vision.
In the context of industrial image inspection, conventional semantic
segmentation models fail to maintain the segmentation consistency of fixed
components across varying contextual environments due to a lack of perception
of object contours. Given the real-time constraints and limited computing
capability of industrial image detection machines, it is also necessary to
create efficient models to reduce computational complexity. In this work, a
Shape-Aware Efficient Network (SPENet) is proposed, which focuses on the shapes
of objects to achieve excellent segmentation consistency by separately
supervising the extraction of boundary and body information from images. In
SPENet, a novel method is introduced for describing fuzzy boundaries to better
adapt to real-world scenarios named Variable Boundary Domain (VBD).
Additionally, a new metric, Consistency Mean Square Error(CMSE), is proposed to
measure segmentation consistency for fixed components. Our approach attains the
best segmentation accuracy and competitive speed on our dataset, showcasing
significant advantages in CMSE among numerous state-of-the-art real-time
segmentation networks, achieving a reduction of over 50% compared to the
previously top-performing models.

Abstract: The combination of Spiking Neural Networks(SNNs) with Vision Transformer
architectures has attracted significant attention due to the great potential
for energy-efficient and high-performance computing paradigms. However, a
substantial performance gap still exists between SNN-based and ANN-based
transformer architectures. While existing methods propose spiking
self-attention mechanisms that are successfully combined with SNNs, the overall
architectures proposed by these methods suffer from a bottleneck in effectively
extracting features from different image scales. In this paper, we address this
issue and propose MSVIT, a novel spike-driven Transformer architecture, which
firstly uses multi-scale spiking attention (MSSA) to enrich the capability of
spiking attention blocks. We validate our approach across various main data
sets. The experimental results show that MSVIT outperforms existing SNN-based
models, positioning itself as a state-of-the-art solution among SNN-transformer
architectures. The codes are available at

Method: 提出基于Turiel领域理论的13个道德主题分类，手动整理2,481个图像-文本对，并标注道德违规主题和来源模态。通过道德判断和道德规范归因任务评估模型。

Result: 在19个主流视觉语言模型上的实验表明，MORALISE对现有模型构成显著挑战，揭示了其道德局限性。

Conclusion: MORALISE为视觉语言模型的道德对齐提供了首个全面基准，揭示了当前模型的不足，并公开了数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images. Reader
discretion is advised. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated
increasing influence in morally sensitive domains such as autonomous driving
and medical analysis, owing to their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. As these models are deployed in high-stakes real-world
applications, it is of paramount importance to ensure that their outputs align
with human moral values and remain within moral boundaries. However, existing
work on moral alignment either focuses solely on textual modalities or relies
heavily on AI-generated images, leading to distributional biases and reduced
realism. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MORALISE, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the moral alignment of vision-language models (VLMs)
using diverse, expert-verified real-world data. We begin by proposing a
comprehensive taxonomy of 13 moral topics grounded in Turiel's Domain Theory,
spanning the personal, interpersonal, and societal moral domains encountered in
everyday life. Built on this framework, we manually curate 2,481 high-quality
image-text pairs, each annotated with two fine-grained labels: (1) topic
annotation, identifying the violated moral topic(s), and (2) modality
annotation, indicating whether the violation arises from the image or the text.
For evaluation, we encompass two tasks, \textit{moral judgment} and
\textit{moral norm attribution}, to assess models' awareness of moral
violations and their reasoning ability on morally salient content. Extensive
experiments on 19 popular open- and closed-source VLMs show that MORALISE poses
a significant challenge, revealing persistent moral limitations in current
state-of-the-art models. The full benchmark is publicly available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ze1025/MORALISE.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks, yet concerns about their potential biases exist. This
work investigates the extent to which prominent VLMs exhibit cultural biases by
evaluating their performance on an image-based country identification task at a
country level. Utilizing the geographically diverse Country211 dataset, we
probe several large vision language models (VLMs) under various prompting
strategies: open-ended questions, multiple-choice questions (MCQs) including
challenging setups like multilingual and adversarial settings. Our analysis
aims to uncover disparities in model accuracy across different countries and
question formats, providing insights into how training data distribution and
evaluation methodologies might influence cultural biases in VLMs. The findings
highlight significant variations in performance, suggesting that while VLMs
possess considerable visual understanding, they inherit biases from their
pre-training data and scale that impact their ability to generalize uniformly
across diverse global contexts.

Abstract: This paper attempts to explore human identity by utilizing neural networks in
an indirect manner. For this exploration, we adopt diffusion models,
state-of-the-art AI generative models trained to create human face images. By
relating the generated human face to human identity, we establish a
correspondence between the face image generation process of the diffusion model
and the process of human identity formation. Through experiments with the
diffusion model, we observe that changes in its external input result in
significant changes in the generated face image. Based on the correspondence,
we indirectly confirm the dependence of human identity on external factors in
the process of human identity formation. Furthermore, we introduce
\textit{Fluidity of Human Identity}, a video artwork that expresses the fluid

Abstract: Many practical medical imaging scenarios include categories that are
under-represented but still crucial. The relevance of image recognition models
to real-world applications lies in their ability to generalize to these rare
classes as well as unseen classes. Real-world generalization requires taking
into account the various complexities that can be encountered in the
real-world. First, training data is highly imbalanced, which may lead to model
exhibiting bias toward the more frequently represented classes. Moreover,
real-world data may contain unseen classes that need to be identified, and
model performance is affected by the data scarcity. While medical image
recognition has been extensively addressed in the literature, current methods
do not take into account all the intricacies in the real-world scenarios. To
this end, we propose an open-set learning method for highly imbalanced medical
datasets using a semi-supervised approach. Understanding the adverse impact of
long-tail distribution at the inherent model characteristics, we implement a
regularization strategy at the feature level complemented by a classifier
normalization technique. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly
available datasets, ISIC2018, ISIC2019, and TissueMNIST with various numbers of
labelled samples. Our analysis shows that addressing the impact of long-tail
data in classification significantly improves the overall performance of the
network in terms of closed-set and open-set accuracies on all datasets. Our

Abstract: This study presents a robust framework that leverages advanced imaging
techniques and machine learning for feature extraction and classification of
key human attributes-namely skin tone, hair color, iris color, and vein-based
undertones. The system employs a multi-stage pipeline involving face detection,
region segmentation, and dominant color extraction to isolate and analyze these
features. Techniques such as X-means clustering, alongside perceptually uniform
distance metrics like Delta E (CIEDE2000), are applied within both LAB and HSV
color spaces to enhance the accuracy of color differentiation. For
classification, the dominant tones of the skin, hair, and iris are extracted
and matched to a custom tone scale, while vein analysis from wrist images
enables undertone classification into "Warm" or "Cool" based on LAB
differences. Each module uses targeted segmentation and color space
transformations to ensure perceptual precision. The system achieves up to 80%

TLDR: ProgGen利用神经符号和大型视觉语言模型（LLM/VLM）进行视频帧预测，通过生成程序估计状态和动态，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为视频监控、机器人应用和自动驾驶等任务提供视觉未来预测，增强对动态世界的理解和准备。

Method: ProgGen利用LLM/VLM生成程序：(i) 估计视频状态；(ii) 预测未来状态；(iii) 渲染为视觉帧。

Result: 在PhyWorld和Cart Pole环境中，ProgGen优于其他视频帧预测方法，支持反事实推理和可解释视频生成。

Conclusion: ProgGen在视频生成任务中表现出高效性和通用性，适用于复杂动态环境。

Abstract: The task of estimating the world model describing the dynamics of a real
world process assumes immense importance for anticipating and preparing for
future outcomes. For applications such as video surveillance, robotics
applications, autonomous driving, etc. this objective entails synthesizing
plausible visual futures, given a few frames of a video to set the visual
context. Towards this end, we propose ProgGen, which undertakes the task of
video frame prediction by representing the dynamics of the video using a set of
neuro-symbolic, human-interpretable set of states (one per frame) by leveraging
the inductive biases of Large (Vision) Language Models (LLM/VLM). In
particular, ProgGen utilizes LLM/VLM to synthesize programs: (i) to estimate
the states of the video, given the visual context (i.e. the frames); (ii) to
predict the states corresponding to future time steps by estimating the
transition dynamics; (iii) to render the predicted states as visual RGB-frames.
Empirical evaluations reveal that our proposed method outperforms competing
techniques at the task of video frame prediction in two challenging
environments: (i) PhyWorld (ii) Cart Pole. Additionally, ProgGen permits
counter-factual reasoning and interpretable video generation attesting to its
effectiveness and generalizability for video generation tasks.

Conclusion: MultiMAE策略显著提升了多模态地球观测数据的迁移学习能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Multi-modal data in Earth Observation (EO) presents a huge opportunity for
improving transfer learning capabilities when pre-training deep learning
models. Unlike prior work that often overlooks multi-modal EO data, recent
methods have started to include it, resulting in more effective pre-training
strategies. However, existing approaches commonly face challenges in
effectively transferring learning to downstream tasks where the structure of
available data differs from that used during pre-training. This paper addresses
this limitation by exploring a more flexible multi-modal, multi-task
pre-training strategy for EO data. Specifically, we adopt a Multi-modal
Multi-task Masked Autoencoder (MultiMAE) that we pre-train by reconstructing
diverse input modalities, including spectral, elevation, and segmentation data.
The pre-trained model demonstrates robust transfer learning capabilities,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods on various EO datasets for
classification and segmentation tasks. Our approach exhibits significant
flexibility, handling diverse input configurations without requiring
modality-specific pre-trained models. Code will be available at:

TLDR: 提出了一种结合域适应、GAN和扩散模型的新方法，用于增强低分辨率航拍图像质量，从而提升树木分割效果，减少对大量标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市森林对环境和生物多样性至关重要，但树木检测因复杂景观和图像分辨率差异而困难，且深度学习依赖大量标注数据。

Method: 整合域适应、GAN（如pix2pix、Real-ESRGAN）和扩散模型（如Latent Diffusion、Stable Diffusion），生成高质量合成样本以扩展训练数据。

Result: 实验显示，低分辨率图像的IoU提升了50%以上，方法优于传统流程。

Conclusion: 该方法为遥感场景提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，尤其在标注资源稀缺时表现突出。

Abstract: Urban forests play a key role in enhancing environmental quality and
supporting biodiversity in cities. Mapping and monitoring these green spaces
are crucial for urban planning and conservation, yet accurately detecting trees
is challenging due to complex landscapes and the variability in image
resolution caused by different satellite sensors or UAV flight altitudes. While
deep learning architectures have shown promise in addressing these challenges,
their effectiveness remains strongly dependent on the availability of large and
manually labeled datasets, which are often expensive and difficult to obtain in
sufficient quantity. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates
domain adaptation with GANs and Diffusion models to enhance the quality of
low-resolution aerial images. Our proposed pipeline enhances low-resolution
imagery while preserving semantic content, enabling effective tree segmentation
without requiring large volumes of manually annotated data. Leveraging models
such as pix2pix, Real-ESRGAN, Latent Diffusion, and Stable Diffusion, we
generate realistic and structurally consistent synthetic samples that expand
the training dataset and unify scale across domains. This approach not only
improves the robustness of segmentation models across different acquisition
conditions but also provides a scalable and replicable solution for remote
sensing scenarios with scarce annotation resources. Experimental results
demonstrated an improvement of over 50% in IoU for low-resolution images,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method compared to traditional pipelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端自动驾驶方法基于密集鸟瞰图特征生成规划，效率低且规划感知有限。

Method: 提出iPad框架，采用ProFormer BEV编码器迭代优化提案及其特征，并引入轻量级提案中心辅助任务（地图和预测）。

Result: 在NAVSIM和CARLA Bench2Drive基准测试中表现最优，且效率显著提升。

Conclusion: iPad框架通过提案中心设计，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的效率和规划质量。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving systems offer a promising alternative to
traditional modular pipelines by reducing information loss and error
accumulation, with significant potential to enhance both mobility and safety.
However, most existing E2E approaches directly generate plans based on dense
bird's-eye view (BEV) grid features, leading to inefficiency and limited
planning awareness. To address these limitations, we propose iterative
Proposal-centric autonomous driving (iPad), a novel framework that places
proposals - a set of candidate future plans - at the center of feature
extraction and auxiliary tasks. Central to iPad is ProFormer, a BEV encoder
that iteratively refines proposals and their associated features through
proposal-anchored attention, effectively fusing multi-view image data.
Additionally, we introduce two lightweight, proposal-centric auxiliary tasks -
mapping and prediction - that improve planning quality with minimal
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and CARLA
Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that iPad achieves state-of-the-art
performance while being significantly more efficient than prior leading
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在医学图像中难以将文本描述与疾病区域关联，主要由于注意力机制效率低下和缺乏细粒度标记表示。

Method: 提出DAP方法，利用视觉语言模型的可解释性图识别适当的图像特征，无需额外像素级标注。

Result: DAP在三个主要胸部X光数据集上，相比现有最佳方法，视觉定位准确率提高了20.74%。

Conclusion: DAP通过简单有效的方式解决了医学图像中视觉定位的挑战，提升了模型的透明度和可信度。

Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) is the capability to identify the specific regions in
an image associated with a particular text description. In medical imaging, VG
enhances interpretability by highlighting relevant pathological features
corresponding to textual descriptions, improving model transparency and
trustworthiness for wider adoption of deep learning models in clinical
practice. Current models struggle to associate textual descriptions with
disease regions due to inefficient attention mechanisms and a lack of
fine-grained token representations. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate
two key observations. First, current VLMs assign high norms to background
tokens, diverting the model's attention from regions of disease. Second, the
global tokens used for cross-modal learning are not representative of local
disease tokens. This hampers identifying correlations between the text and
disease tokens. To address this, we introduce simple, yet effective
Disease-Aware Prompting (DAP) process, which uses the explainability map of a
VLM to identify the appropriate image features. This simple strategy amplifies
disease-relevant regions while suppressing background interference. Without any
additional pixel-level annotations, DAP improves visual grounding accuracy by
20.74% compared to state-of-the-art methods across three major chest X-ray
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了目标类与非目标类知识流的冲突，且低置信度的暗知识引入噪声信号，影响知识传递效果。

Method: 设计了基于梯度信噪比（GSNR）的独立动量更新器，并引入动态top-k掩码（DTM）机制逐步增加非目标类的参与。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、ImageNet和MS-COCO上的实验验证了DeepKD的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepKD通过解耦和去噪机制显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation have emphasized the importance of
decoupling different knowledge components. While existing methods utilize
momentum mechanisms to separate task-oriented and distillation gradients, they
overlook the inherent conflict between target-class and non-target-class
knowledge flows. Furthermore, low-confidence dark knowledge in non-target
classes introduces noisy signals that hinder effective knowledge transfer. To
address these limitations, we propose DeepKD, a novel training framework that
integrates dual-level decoupling with adaptive denoising. First, through
theoretical analysis of gradient signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR) characteristics
in task-oriented and non-task-oriented knowledge distillation, we design
independent momentum updaters for each component to prevent mutual
interference. We observe that the optimal momentum coefficients for
task-oriented gradient (TOG), target-class gradient (TCG), and non-target-class
gradient (NCG) should be positively related to their GSNR. Second, we introduce
a dynamic top-k mask (DTM) mechanism that gradually increases K from a small
initial value to incorporate more non-target classes as training progresses,
following curriculum learning principles. The DTM jointly filters
low-confidence logits from both teacher and student models, effectively
purifying dark knowledge during early training. Extensive experiments on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO demonstrate DeepKD's effectiveness. Our code

Conclusion: IC-Fusion通过红外为中心的融合策略，显著提升了多光谱目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Multispectral object detection aims to leverage complementary information
from visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) modalities to enable robust performance
under diverse environmental conditions. In this letter, we propose IC-Fusion, a
multispectral object detector that effectively fuses visible and infrared
features through a lightweight and modalityaware design. Motivated by wavelet
analysis and empirical observations, we find that IR images contain
structurally rich high-frequency information critical for object localization,
while RGB images provide complementary semantic context. To exploit this, we
adopt a compact RGB backbone and design a novel fusion module comprising a
Multi-Scale Feature Distillation (MSFD) block to enhance RGB features and a
three-stage fusion block with Cross-Modal Channel Shuffle Gate (CCSG) and
Cross-Modal Large Kernel Gate (CLKG) to facilitate effective cross-modal
interaction. Experiments on the FLIR and LLVIP benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our IR-centric fusion strategy. Our code is

Method: 采用模态特定的GNNs提取特征，引入跨模态注意力网络融合特征，并使用MLP-Mixer层优化全局和局部特征。

Result: 在两个临床数据集上表现出优越性能，验证了框架的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ConneX方法有效整合多模态数据，提升了神经精神疾病（如精神分裂症）的诊断准确性。

Abstract: Gaining insights into the structural and functional mechanisms of the brain
has been a longstanding focus in neuroscience research, particularly in the
context of understanding and treating neuropsychiatric disorders such as
Schizophrenia (SZ). Nevertheless, most of the traditional multimodal deep
learning approaches fail to fully leverage the complementary characteristics of
structural and functional connectomics data to enhance diagnostic performance.
To address this issue, we proposed ConneX, a multimodal fusion method that
integrates cross-attention mechanism and multilayer perceptron (MLP)-Mixer for
refined feature fusion. Modality-specific backbone graph neural networks (GNNs)
were firstly employed to obtain feature representation for each modality. A
unified cross-modal attention network was then introduced to fuse these
embeddings by capturing intra- and inter-modal interactions, while MLP-Mixer
layers refined global and local features, leveraging higher-order dependencies
for end-to-end classification with a multi-head joint loss. Extensive
evaluations demonstrated improved performance on two distinct clinical
datasets, highlighting the robustness of our proposed framework.

Abstract: Cinematography is a cornerstone of film production and appreciation, shaping
mood, emotion, and narrative through visual elements such as camera movement,
shot composition, and lighting. Despite recent progress in multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) and video generation models, the capacity of current
models to grasp and reproduce cinematographic techniques remains largely
uncharted, hindered by the scarcity of expert-annotated data. To bridge this
gap, we present CineTechBench, a pioneering benchmark founded on precise,
manual annotation by seasoned cinematography experts across key cinematography
dimensions. Our benchmark covers seven essential aspects-shot scale, shot
angle, composition, camera movement, lighting, color, and focal length-and
includes over 600 annotated movie images and 120 movie clips with clear
cinematographic techniques. For the understanding task, we design question
answer pairs and annotated descriptions to assess MLLMs' ability to interpret
and explain cinematographic techniques. For the generation task, we assess
advanced video generation models on their capacity to reconstruct
cinema-quality camera movements given conditions such as textual prompts or
keyframes. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on 15+ MLLMs and 5+ video
generation models. Our results offer insights into the limitations of current
models and future directions for cinematography understanding and generation in
automatically film production and appreciation. The code and benchmark can be

Conclusion: 本文全面总结了DL-based RSISS的进展，指出了关键突破、比较见解和未来研究的开放挑战。

Abstract: Remote sensing images (RSIs) capture both natural and human-induced changes
on the Earth's surface, serving as essential data for environmental monitoring,
urban planning, and resource management. Semantic segmentation (SS) of RSIs
enables the fine-grained interpretation of surface features, making it a
critical task in remote sensing analysis. With the increasing diversity and
volume of RSIs collected by sensors on various platforms, traditional
processing methods struggle to maintain efficiency and accuracy. In response,
deep learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative approach, enabling
substantial advances in remote sensing image semantic segmentation (RSISS) by
automating feature extraction and improving segmentation accuracy across
diverse modalities. This paper revisits the evolution of DL-based RSISS by
categorizing existing approaches into four stages: the early pixel-based
methods, the prevailing patch-based and tile-based techniques, and the emerging
image-based strategies enabled by foundation models. We analyze these
developments from the perspective of feature extraction and learning
strategies, revealing the field's progression from pixel-level to tile-level
and from unimodal to multimodal segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of nearly 40 advanced techniques on a unified dataset
to quantitatively characterize their performance and applicability. This review
offers a holistic view of DL-based SS for RS, highlighting key advancements,
comparative insights, and open challenges to guide future research.

Conclusion: ALN-P3通过跨模态对齐实现了驾驶与语言推理的双重优化，且无需推理额外开销。

Abstract: Recent advances have explored integrating large language models (LLMs) into
end-to-end autonomous driving systems to enhance generalization and
interpretability. However, most existing approaches are limited to either
driving performance or vision-language reasoning, making it difficult to
achieve both simultaneously. In this paper, we propose ALN-P3, a unified
co-distillation framework that introduces cross-modal alignment between "fast"
vision-based autonomous driving systems and "slow" language-driven reasoning
modules. ALN-P3 incorporates three novel alignment mechanisms: Perception
Alignment (P1A), Prediction Alignment (P2A), and Planning Alignment (P3A),
which explicitly align visual tokens with corresponding linguistic outputs
across the full perception, prediction, and planning stack. All alignment
modules are applied only during training and incur no additional costs during
inference. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks-nuScenes, Nu-X,
TOD3Cap, and nuScenes QA-demonstrate that ALN-P3 significantly improves both
driving decisions and language reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 解决Vision Transformers因规模庞大导致的计算开销问题，同时避免现有令牌压缩技术的信息丢失和额外训练需求。

Method: 提出自适应令牌合并（ATM），通过层间相似性阈值调整和令牌匹配技术，实现无损令牌合并。

Result: 在多种预训练模型上验证，ATM优于现有无需训练方法，甚至超过多数需训练方法，FLOPs减少30%且精度不降。

Conclusion: ATM是一种高效的无损令牌合并方法，显著降低计算成本，无需额外训练即可保持性能。

Abstract: Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become the standard architecture in
computer vision, their massive sizes lead to significant computational
overhead. Token compression techniques have attracted considerable attention to
address this issue, but they often suffer from severe information loss,
requiring extensive additional training to achieve practical performance. In
this paper, we propose Adaptive Token Merging (ATM), a novel method that
ensures lossless token merging, eliminating the need for fine-tuning while
maintaining competitive performance. ATM adaptively reduces tokens across
layers and batches by carefully adjusting layer-specific similarity thresholds,
thereby preventing the undesirable merging of less similar tokens with respect
to each layer. Furthermore, ATM introduces a novel token matching technique
that considers not only similarity but also merging sizes, particularly for the
final layers, to minimize the information loss incurred from each merging
operation. We empirically validate our method across a wide range of pretrained
models, demonstrating that ATM not only outperforms all existing training-free
methods but also surpasses most training-intensive approaches, even without
additional training. Remarkably, training-free ATM achieves over a 30%
reduction in FLOPs for the DeiT-T and DeiT-S models without any drop in their
original accuracy.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖标题长度等简单指标，无法准确衡量标题的详细程度，影响了T2I模型的生成质量。

Method: 提出图像覆盖率（ICR）和平均对象详细度（AOD）两个指标，用于评估标题的详细程度。

Result: 在COCO数据集上实验显示，基于ICR和AOD选择的数据训练T2I模型，性能优于全数据集和基于长度的选择方法。

Conclusion: 详细感知的度量标准比基于长度的启发式方法更有效，对T2I任务的数据选择至关重要。

Abstract: Training text-to-image (T2I) models with detailed captions can significantly
improve their generation quality. Existing methods often rely on simplistic
metrics like caption length to represent the detailness of the caption in the
T2I training set. In this paper, we propose a new metric to estimate caption
detailness based on two aspects: image coverage rate (ICR), which evaluates
whether the caption covers all regions/objects in the image, and average object
detailness (AOD), which quantifies the detailness of each object's description.
Through experiments on the COCO dataset using ShareGPT4V captions, we
demonstrate that T2I models trained on high-ICR and -AOD captions achieve
superior performance on DPG and other benchmarks. Notably, our metric enables
more effective data selection-training on only 20% of full data surpasses both
full-dataset training and length-based selection method, improving alignment
and reconstruction ability. These findings highlight the critical role of
detail-aware metrics over length-based heuristics in caption selection for T2I
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGC advancements in video generation pose risks to information integrity and public trust, especially with human-centric videos. Existing detection methods lack robustness and scalability.

Method: Proposes AvatarShield with GRPO for training, dual-encoder architecture for semantic and artifact analysis, and introduces FakeHumanVid benchmark for evaluation.

Result: AvatarShield outperforms existing methods in in-domain and cross-domain detection, setting a new standard for video forensics.

Conclusion: AvatarShield addresses key challenges in fake video detection, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for human-centric content.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)
technologies, particularly in video generation, has led to unprecedented
creative capabilities but also increased threats to information integrity,
identity security, and public trust. Existing detection methods, while
effective in general scenarios, lack robust solutions for human-centric videos,
which pose greater risks due to their realism and potential for legal and
ethical misuse. Moreover, current detection approaches often suffer from poor
generalization, limited scalability, and reliance on labor-intensive supervised
fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, the first
interpretable MLLM-based framework for detecting human-centric fake videos,
enhanced via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through our carefully
designed accuracy detection reward and temporal compensation reward, it
effectively avoids the use of high-cost text annotation data, enabling precise
temporal modeling and forgery detection. Meanwhile, we design a dual-encoder
architecture, combining high-level semantic reasoning and low-level artifact
amplification to guide MLLMs in effective forgery detection. We further collect
FakeHumanVid, a large-scale human-centric video benchmark that includes
synthesis methods guided by pose, audio, and text inputs, enabling rigorous
evaluation of detection methods in real-world scenes. Extensive experiments
show that AvatarShield significantly outperforms existing approaches in both
in-domain and cross-domain detection, setting a new standard for human-centric
video forensics.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，方法显著提升了跨数据集识别性能，且不影响源域准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了跨域步态识别中的优化冲突和数据冗余问题。

Abstract: Generalized gait recognition, which aims to achieve robust performance across
diverse domains, remains a challenging problem due to severe domain shifts in
viewpoints, appearances, and environments. While mixed-dataset training is
widely used to enhance generalization, it introduces new obstacles including
inter-dataset optimization conflicts and redundant or noisy samples, both of
which hinder effective representation learning. To address these challenges, we
propose a unified framework that systematically improves cross-domain gait
recognition. First, we design a disentangled triplet loss that isolates
supervision signals across datasets, mitigating gradient conflicts during
optimization. Second, we introduce a targeted dataset distillation strategy
that filters out the least informative 20\% of training samples based on

Motivation: 现有红外小目标检测方法忽视辅助元数据（如成像参数和采集条件），导致在复杂场景中泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 辅助元数据的引入显著提升了红外小目标检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Omni-domain infrared small target detection (IRSTD) poses formidable
challenges, as a single model must seamlessly adapt to diverse imaging systems,
varying resolutions, and multiple spectral bands simultaneously. Current
approaches predominantly rely on visual-only modeling paradigms that not only
struggle with complex background interference and inherently scarce target
features, but also exhibit limited generalization capabilities across complex
omni-scene environments where significant domain shifts and appearance
variations occur. In this work, we reveal a critical oversight in existing
paradigms: the neglect of readily available auxiliary metadata describing
imaging parameters and acquisition conditions, such as spectral bands, sensor
platforms, resolution, and observation perspectives. To address this
limitation, we propose the Auxiliary Metadata Driven Infrared Small Target
Detector (AuxDet), a novel multi-modal framework that fundamentally reimagines
the IRSTD paradigm by incorporating textual metadata for scene-aware
optimization. Through a high-dimensional fusion module based on multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), AuxDet dynamically integrates metadata semantics with
visual features, guiding adaptive representation learning for each individual
sample. Additionally, we design a lightweight prior-initialized enhancement
module using 1D convolutional blocks to further refine fused features and
recover fine-grained target cues. Extensive experiments on the challenging
WideIRSTD-Full benchmark demonstrate that AuxDet consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, validating the critical role of auxiliary information
in improving robustness and accuracy in omni-domain IRSTD tasks. Code is

Conclusion: MonoSplat在保持计算效率的同时，实现了高质量的高斯重建和泛化。

Abstract: Recent advances in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated
promising results in real-time high-fidelity rendering without per-scene
optimization, yet existing approaches still struggle to handle unfamiliar
visual content during inference on novel scenes due to limited
generalizability. To address this challenge, we introduce MonoSplat, a novel
framework that leverages rich visual priors from pre-trained monocular depth
foundation models for robust Gaussian reconstruction. Our approach consists of
two key components: a Mono-Multi Feature Adapter that transforms monocular
features into multi-view representations, coupled with an Integrated Gaussian
Prediction module that effectively fuses both feature types for precise
Gaussian generation. Through the Adapter's lightweight attention mechanism,
features are seamlessly aligned and aggregated across views while preserving
valuable monocular priors, enabling the Prediction module to generate Gaussian
primitives with accurate geometry and appearance. Through extensive experiments
on diverse real-world datasets, we convincingly demonstrate that MonoSplat
achieves superior reconstruction quality and generalization capability compared
to existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency with minimal
trainable parameters. Codes are available at

Conclusion: MAADA在跨域泛化和结构鲁棒性上表现优异。

Abstract: Transfer learning under domain shift remains a fundamental challenge due to
the divergence between source and target data manifolds. In this paper, we
propose MAADA (Manifold-Aware Adversarial Data Augmentation), a novel framework
that decomposes adversarial perturbations into on-manifold and off-manifold
components to simultaneously capture semantic variation and model brittleness.
We theoretically demonstrate that enforcing on-manifold consistency reduces
hypothesis complexity and improves generalization, while off-manifold
regularization smooths decision boundaries in low-density regions. Moreover, we
introduce a geometry-aware alignment loss that minimizes geodesic discrepancy
between source and target manifolds. Experiments on DomainNet, VisDA, and
Office-Home show that MAADA consistently outperforms existing adversarial and
adaptation methods in both unsupervised and few-shot settings, demonstrating
superior structural robustness and cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Foundation models have ushered in a new era for multimodal video
understanding by enabling the extraction of rich spatiotemporal and semantic
representations. In this work, we introduce a novel graph-based framework that
integrates a vision-language foundation, leveraging VideoMAE for dynamic visual
encoding and BERT for contextual textual embedding, to address the challenge of
recognizing fine-grained bimanual manipulation actions. Departing from
conventional static graph architectures, our approach constructs an adaptive
multimodal graph where nodes represent frames, objects, and textual
annotations, and edges encode spatial, temporal, and semantic relationships.
These graph structures evolve dynamically based on learned interactions,
allowing for flexible and context-aware reasoning. A task-specific attention
mechanism within a Graph Attention Network further enhances this reasoning by
modulating edge importance based on action semantics. Through extensive
evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the strength
of combining foundation models with dynamic graph-based reasoning for robust
and generalizable action recognition.

Abstract: Domain adaptation remains a challenge when there is significant manifold
discrepancy between source and target domains. Although recent methods leverage
manifold-aware adversarial perturbations to perform data augmentation, they
often neglect precise manifold alignment and systematic exploration of
structured perturbations. To address this, we propose GAMA (Geometry-Aware
Manifold Alignment), a structured framework that achieves explicit manifold
alignment via adversarial perturbation guided by geometric information. GAMA
systematically employs tangent space exploration and manifold-constrained
adversarial optimization, simultaneously enhancing semantic consistency,
robustness to off-manifold deviations, and cross-domain alignment. Theoretical
analysis shows that GAMA tightens the generalization bound via structured
regularization and explicit alignment. Empirical results on DomainNet, VisDA,
and Office-Home demonstrate that GAMA consistently outperforms existing
adversarial and adaptation methods in both unsupervised and few-shot settings,
exhibiting superior robustness, generalization, and manifold alignment
capability.

Motivation: 当前的手势生成方法仅依赖浅层语言线索（如语音或文本），忽略了手势背后的交流意图，导致生成的语义浅薄。

Method: 提出Intentional-Gesture框架，利用大型视觉语言模型自动标注手势意图，并通过Intentional Gesture Motion Tokenizer将意图注入运动表示中。

Result: 在BEAT-2基准测试中达到最新性能，生成的手势既时间同步又语义丰富。

Conclusion: 该框架为数字人类和具身AI中的表达性手势生成提供了模块化基础。

Abstract: When humans speak, gestures help convey communicative intentions, such as
adding emphasis or describing concepts. However, current co-speech gesture
generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (\textit{e.g.}
speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the
communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs
that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Intentional-Gesture}, a novel framework
that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in
high-level communicative functions. % First, we curate the \textbf{InG} dataset
by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (\textit{i.e.}, text
sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using
large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the \textbf{Intentional
Gesture Motion Tokenizer} to leverage these intention annotations. It injects
high-level communicative functions (\textit{e.g.}, intentions) into tokenized
motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are
both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new
state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a
modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and
embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture

Conclusion: Flashback通过消除推理时的LLM调用，实现了实时检测，并在性能上取得突破。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from
video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance
deployments. However, three fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption:
domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous
processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot
and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive
mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based
on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In
the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of
both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data.
In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched
against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at
inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU.
On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp),
respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.

Abstract: Transferring 2D textures to 3D modalities is of great significance for
improving the efficiency of multimedia content creation. Existing approaches
have rarely focused on transferring image textures onto 3D representations. 3D
style transfer methods are capable of transferring abstract artistic styles to
3D scenes. However, these methods often overlook the geometric information of
the scene, which makes it challenging to achieve high-quality 3D texture
transfer results. In this paper, we present GT^2-GS, a geometry-aware texture
transfer framework for gaussian splitting. From the perspective of matching
texture features with geometric information in rendered views, we identify the
issue of insufficient texture features and propose a geometry-aware texture
augmentation module to expand the texture feature set. Moreover, a
geometry-consistent texture loss is proposed to optimize texture features into
the scene representation. This loss function incorporates both camera pose and
3D geometric information of the scene, enabling controllable texture-oriented
appearance editing. Finally, a geometry preservation strategy is introduced. By
alternating between the texture transfer and geometry correction stages over
multiple iterations, this strategy achieves a balance between learning texture
features and preserving geometric integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness and controllability of our method. Through geometric
awareness, our approach achieves texture transfer results that better align
with human visual perception. Our homepage is available at

Abstract: Although existing CLIP-based methods for detecting AI-generated images have
achieved promising results, they are still limited by severe feature
redundancy, which hinders their generalization ability. To address this issue,
incorporating an information bottleneck network into the task presents a
straightforward solution. However, relying solely on image-corresponding
prompts results in suboptimal performance due to the inherent diversity of
prompts. In this paper, we propose a multimodal conditional bottleneck network
to reduce feature redundancy while enhancing the discriminative power of
features extracted by CLIP, thereby improving the model's generalization
ability. We begin with a semantic analysis experiment, where we observe that
arbitrary text features exhibit lower cosine similarity with real image
features than with fake image features in the CLIP feature space, a phenomenon
we refer to as "bias". Therefore, we introduce InfoFD, a text-guided
AI-generated image detection framework. InfoFD consists of two key components:
the Text-Guided Conditional Information Bottleneck (TGCIB) and Dynamic Text
Orthogonalization (DTO). TGCIB improves the generalizability of learned
representations by conditioning on both text and class modalities. DTO
dynamically updates weighted text features, preserving semantic information
while leveraging the global "bias". Our model achieves exceptional
generalization performance on the GenImage dataset and latest generative
models. Our code is available at https://github.com/Ant0ny44/InfoFD.

Abstract: Recently, continuous representation methods emerge as novel paradigms that
characterize the intrinsic structures of real-world data through function
representations that map positional coordinates to their corresponding values
in the continuous space. As compared with the traditional discrete framework,
the continuous framework demonstrates inherent superiority for data
representation and reconstruction (e.g., image restoration, novel view
synthesis, and waveform inversion) by offering inherent advantages including
resolution flexibility, cross-modal adaptability, inherent smoothness, and
parameter efficiency. In this review, we systematically examine recent
advancements in continuous representation frameworks, focusing on three
aspects: (i) Continuous representation method designs such as basis function
representation, statistical modeling, tensor function decomposition, and
implicit neural representation; (ii) Theoretical foundations of continuous
representations such as approximation error analysis, convergence property, and
implicit regularization; (iii) Real-world applications of continuous
representations derived from computer vision, graphics, bioinformatics, and
remote sensing. Furthermore, we outline future directions and perspectives to
inspire exploration and deepen insights to facilitate continuous representation
methods, theories, and applications. All referenced works are summarized in our

Motivation: 3D场景理解在机器人、自动驾驶等领域至关重要，但面临计算成本高和高质量标注数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 提出CLIP驱动的双指标质量（DIQ）过滤器，结合视觉-语言对齐分数和标题损失困惑度，并使用课程调度器逐步扩展训练数据。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D数据集上，DC-Scene实现了86.1 CIDEr的SOTA性能，训练成本降低约三分之二。

Conclusion: 高质量小样本训练可超越大规模数据训练，DC-Scene为3D场景理解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D scene understanding plays a fundamental role in vision applications such
as robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. However, advancing
learning-based 3D scene understanding remains challenging due to two key
limitations: (1) the large scale and complexity of 3D scenes lead to higher
computational costs and slower training compared to 2D counterparts; and (2)
high-quality annotated 3D datasets are significantly scarcer than those
available for 2D vision. These challenges underscore the need for more
efficient learning paradigms. In this work, we propose DC-Scene, a data-centric
framework tailored for 3D scene understanding, which emphasizes enhancing data
quality and training efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a CLIP-driven
dual-indicator quality (DIQ) filter, combining vision-language alignment scores
with caption-loss perplexity, along with a curriculum scheduler that
progressively expands the training pool from the top 25% to 75% of
scene-caption pairs. This strategy filters out noisy samples and significantly
reduces dependence on large-scale labeled 3D data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D demonstrate that DC-Scene achieves state-of-the-art
performance (86.1 CIDEr with the top-75% subset vs. 85.4 with the full dataset)
while reducing training cost by approximately two-thirds, confirming that a
compact set of high-quality samples can outperform exhaustive training. Code

Motivation: 现有检测器仅依赖单一模态的痕迹或跨模态不一致性，无法有效应对多模态深度伪造的挑战。

Method: CAD框架包含两部分：跨模态对齐（检测语义不一致）和跨模态蒸馏（融合特征时保留模态特定痕迹）。

Result: 实验表明，CAD在多模态和单模态深度伪造基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 和谐整合多模态互补信息是提升深度伪造检测性能的关键。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of multimodal deepfakes (visual and auditory content are
manipulated in concert) undermines the reliability of existing detectors that
rely solely on modality-specific artifacts or cross-modal inconsistencies. In
this work, we first demonstrate that modality-specific forensic traces (e.g.,
face-swap artifacts or spectral distortions) and modality-shared semantic
misalignments (e.g., lip-speech asynchrony) offer complementary evidence, and
that neglecting either aspect limits detection performance. Existing approaches
either naively fuse modality-specific features without reconciling their
conflicting characteristics or focus predominantly on semantic misalignment at
the expense of modality-specific fine-grained artifact cues. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a general multimodal framework for video deepfake
detection via Cross-Modal Alignment and Distillation (CAD). CAD comprises two
core components: 1) Cross-modal alignment that identifies inconsistencies in
high-level semantic synchronization (e.g., lip-speech mismatches); 2)
Cross-modal distillation that mitigates feature conflicts during fusion while
preserving modality-specific forensic traces (e.g., spectral distortions in
synthetic audio). Extensive experiments on both multimodal and unimodal (e.g.,
image-only/video-only)deepfake benchmarks demonstrate that CAD significantly
outperforms previous methods, validating the necessity of harmonious
integration of multimodal complementary information.

Conclusion: GAMA++为迁移学习中的语义几何对齐设定了新标准。

Abstract: Despite progress in geometry-aware domain adaptation, current methods such as
GAMA still suffer from two unresolved issues: (1) insufficient disentanglement
of task-relevant and task-irrelevant manifold dimensions, and (2) rigid
perturbation schemes that ignore per-class alignment asymmetries. To address
this, we propose GAMA++, a novel framework that introduces (i) latent space
disentanglement to isolate label-consistent manifold directions from nuisance
factors, and (ii) an adaptive contrastive perturbation strategy that tailors
both on- and off-manifold exploration to class-specific manifold curvature and
alignment discrepancy. We further propose a cross-domain contrastive
consistency loss that encourages local semantic clusters to align while
preserving intra-domain diversity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results
on DomainNet, Office-Home, and VisDA benchmarks under both standard and
few-shot settings, with notable improvements in class-level alignment fidelity
and boundary robustness. GAMA++ sets a new standard for semantic geometry
alignment in transfer learning.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training deep
neural networks, particularly in medical imaging where labeled data is scarce.
While current approaches typically rely on synthetic augmentations of single
images, we propose VET-DINO, a framework that leverages a unique characteristic
of medical imaging: the availability of multiple standardized views from the
same study. Using a series of clinical veterinary radiographs from the same
patient study, we enable models to learn view-invariant anatomical structures
and develop an implied 3D understanding from 2D projections. We demonstrate our
approach on a dataset of 5 million veterinary radiographs from 668,000 canine
studies. Through extensive experimentation, including view synthesis and
downstream task performance, we show that learning from real multi-view pairs
leads to superior anatomical understanding compared to purely synthetic
augmentations. VET-DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on various
veterinary imaging tasks. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
self-supervised learning in medical imaging that leverages domain-specific
properties rather than merely adapting natural image techniques.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in volumetric medical images
is crucial for clinical applications, including disease monitoring and cancer
treatment planning. Contemporary interactive segmentation models, such as
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) and its medical variant (MedSAM-2), rely on
manually provided prompts like bounding boxes and mouse clicks. In this study,
we introduce eye gaze as a novel informational modality for interactive
segmentation, marking the application of eye-tracking for 3D medical image
segmentation. We evaluate the performance of using gaze-based prompts with
SAM-2 and MedSAM-2 using both synthetic and real gaze data. Compared to
bounding boxes, gaze-based prompts offer a time-efficient interaction approach
with slightly lower segmentation quality. Our findings highlight the potential
of using gaze as a complementary input modality for interactive 3D medical

TLDR: 通过微调生成模型（如Stable Diffusion和MAE）用于类别无关的实例分割，模型展现出强大的零样本泛化能力，甚至在某些情况下超越监督模型SAM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成模型是否能够通过学习图像合成任务中的对象边界和场景组合，实现通用的感知组织能力。

Method: 使用实例着色损失对Stable Diffusion和MAE进行微调，仅针对少量对象类型（室内家具和汽车）。

Result: 模型在未见过的对象类型和风格上表现出色，甚至在精细结构和模糊边界的分割上优于SAM。

Conclusion: 生成模型具有跨类别和领域的固有分组机制，无需大规模预训练即可实现泛化。

Abstract: By pretraining to synthesize coherent images from perturbed inputs,
generative models inherently learn to understand object boundaries and scene
compositions. How can we repurpose these generative representations for
general-purpose perceptual organization? We finetune Stable Diffusion and MAE
(encoder+decoder) for category-agnostic instance segmentation using our
instance coloring loss exclusively on a narrow set of object types (indoor
furnishings and cars). Surprisingly, our models exhibit strong zero-shot
generalization, accurately segmenting objects of types and styles unseen in
finetuning (and in many cases, MAE's ImageNet-1K pretraining too). Our
best-performing models closely approach the heavily supervised SAM when
evaluated on unseen object types and styles, and outperform it when segmenting
fine structures and ambiguous boundaries. In contrast, existing promptable
segmentation architectures or discriminatively pretrained models fail to
generalize. This suggests that generative models learn an inherent grouping
mechanism that transfers across categories and domains, even without
internet-scale pretraining. Code, pretrained models, and demos are available on
our website.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索LVLMs在面对特定语义概念时容易产生幻觉和错误的根本原因，为改进模型鲁棒性提供具体方向。

Method: 方法结合了LLMs和T2I模型，通过语义概念的交叉和突变生成图像描述，再转换为视觉输入测试LVLMs的性能，以量化语义敏感性。

Result: 实验验证了框架在七种主流LVLMs和两种多模态任务中的有效性，并揭示了LVLMs的敏感语义特征。

Conclusion: 结论表明该方法能有效识别LVLMs的敏感语义，为未来研究提供了启发。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks aim to generate malicious inputs that mislead deep
models, but beyond causing model failure, they cannot provide certain
interpretable information such as ``\textit{What content in inputs make models
more likely to fail?}'' However, this information is crucial for researchers to
specifically improve model robustness. Recent research suggests that models may
be particularly sensitive to certain semantics in visual inputs (such as
``wet,'' ``foggy''), making them prone to errors. Inspired by this, in this
paper we conducted the first exploration on large vision-language models
(LVLMs) and found that LVLMs indeed are susceptible to hallucinations and
various errors when facing specific semantic concepts in images. To efficiently
search for these sensitive concepts, we integrated large language models (LLMs)
and text-to-image (T2I) models to propose a novel semantic evolution framework.
Randomly initialized semantic concepts undergo LLM-based crossover and mutation
operations to form image descriptions, which are then converted by T2I models
into visual inputs for LVLMs. The task-specific performance of LVLMs on each
input is quantified as fitness scores for the involved semantics and serves as
reward signals to further guide LLMs in exploring concepts that induce LVLMs.
Extensive experiments on seven mainstream LVLMs and two multimodal tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we provide
interesting findings about the sensitive semantics of LVLMs, aiming to inspire
further in-depth research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限环境中部署机器学习模型需要将大数据集压缩为小而信息丰富的合成数据集，但现有方法在极端样本稀缺时无法保持语义丰富性。

Method: 通过集成对比学习优化图像合成，最大化实例级特征区分，生成更丰富多样的合成样本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型在极小规模合成数据集上的性能，并提高了合成图像的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 结合对比学习的数据集蒸馏方法在极端数据稀缺情况下优于现有技术。

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models in resource-constrained environments, such
as edge devices or rapid prototyping scenarios, increasingly demands
distillation of large datasets into significantly smaller yet informative
synthetic datasets. Current dataset distillation techniques, particularly
Trajectory Matching methods, optimize synthetic data so that the model's
training trajectory on synthetic samples mirrors that on real data. While
demonstrating efficacy on medium-scale synthetic datasets, these methods fail
to adequately preserve semantic richness under extreme sample scarcity. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel dataset distillation method
integrating contrastive learning during image synthesis. By explicitly
maximizing instance-level feature discrimination, our approach produces more
informative and diverse synthetic samples, even when dataset sizes are
significantly constrained. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating
contrastive learning substantially enhances the performance of models trained
on very small-scale synthetic datasets. This integration not only guides more
effective feature representation but also significantly improves the visual
fidelity of the synthesized images. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves notable performance improvements over existing distillation
techniques, especially in scenarios with extremely limited synthetic data.

TLDR: LiveVLM是一个无需训练的框架，专为实时视频理解和交互设计，通过创新的流式KV缓存技术显著提升处理速度和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型主要关注离线视频问答，忽略了内存使用和响应速度，而这两者在实际应用中至关重要。

Method: LiveVLM采用流式KV缓存技术实时处理视频流，保留长期细节并消除冗余KV，同时生成和压缩视频KV张量以提高内存效率。

Result: 实验表明，LiveVLM在相同设备上可处理44倍帧数，响应速度比现有在线方法快5倍（256帧输入），且性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: LiveVLM为实时视频处理提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了处理能力和响应速度。

Abstract: Recent developments in Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have enabled
models to process long video sequences and demonstrate remarkable performance.
Nonetheless, studies predominantly focus on offline video question answering,
neglecting memory usage and response speed that are essential in various
real-world applications, such as Deepseek services, autonomous driving, and
robotics. To mitigate these challenges, we propose $\textbf{LiveVLM}$, a
training-free framework specifically designed for streaming, online video
understanding and real-time interaction. Unlike existing works that process
videos only after one question is posed, LiveVLM constructs an innovative
streaming-oriented KV cache to process video streams in real-time, retain
long-term video details and eliminate redundant KVs, ensuring prompt responses
to user queries. For continuous video streams, LiveVLM generates and compresses
video key-value tensors (video KVs) to reserve visual information while
improving memory efficiency. Furthermore, when a new question is proposed,
LiveVLM incorporates an online question-answering process that efficiently
fetches both short-term and long-term visual information, while minimizing
interference from redundant context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
LiveVLM enables the foundation LLaVA-OneVision model to process 44$\times$
number of frames on the same device, and achieves up to 5$\times$ speedup in
response speed compared with SoTA online methods at an input of 256 frames,
while maintaining the same or better model performance.

Conclusion: DiffProb显著减少训练成本和数据量，提升人脸识别效率，降低对大规模数据集的依赖。

Abstract: Face recognition models have made substantial progress due to advances in
deep learning and the availability of large-scale datasets. However, reliance
on massive annotated datasets introduces challenges related to training
computational cost and data storage, as well as potential privacy concerns
regarding managing large face datasets. This paper presents DiffProb, the first
data pruning approach for the application of face recognition. DiffProb
assesses the prediction probabilities of training samples within each identity
and prunes the ones with identical or close prediction probability values, as
they are likely reinforcing the same decision boundaries, and thus contribute
minimally with new information. We further enhance this process with an
auxiliary cleaning mechanism to eliminate mislabeled and label-flipped samples,
boosting data quality with minimal loss. Extensive experiments on CASIA-WebFace
with different pruning ratios and multiple benchmarks, including LFW, CFP-FP,
and IJB-C, demonstrate that DiffProb can prune up to 50% of the dataset while
maintaining or even, in some settings, improving the verification accuracies.
Additionally, we demonstrate DiffProb's robustness across different
architectures and loss functions. Our method significantly reduces training
cost and data volume, enabling efficient face recognition training and reducing
the reliance on massive datasets and their demanding management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件数据集通常从密集RGB视频合成，缺乏视角多样性和几何一致性，或依赖昂贵硬件。GS2E旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过3D高斯散射重建真实静态场景，结合物理事件模拟管道，包括自适应轨迹插值和事件对比阈值建模。

Result: 实验表明，GS2E在事件3D重建中表现优异，具有强泛化能力和实用价值。

Conclusion: GS2E为事件视觉研究提供了高质量基准，克服了现有数据集的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce GS2E (Gaussian Splatting to Event), a large-scale synthetic
event dataset for high-fidelity event vision tasks, captured from real-world
sparse multi-view RGB images. Existing event datasets are often synthesized
from dense RGB videos, which typically lack viewpoint diversity and geometric
consistency, or depend on expensive, difficult-to-scale hardware setups. GS2E
overcomes these limitations by first reconstructing photorealistic static
scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting, and subsequently employing a novel,
physically-informed event simulation pipeline. This pipeline generally
integrates adaptive trajectory interpolation with physically-consistent event
contrast threshold modeling. Such an approach yields temporally dense and
geometrically consistent event streams under diverse motion and lighting
conditions, while ensuring strong alignment with underlying scene structures.
Experimental results on event-based 3D reconstruction demonstrate GS2E's
superior generalization capabilities and its practical value as a benchmark for
advancing event vision research.

Conclusion: R3GS通过创新的混合表示和优化技术，有效解决了无约束数据集中的重建和重定位问题，性能优于基线方法。

Abstract: We propose R3GS, a robust reconstruction and relocalization framework
tailored for unconstrained datasets. Our method uses a hybrid representation
during training. Each anchor combines a global feature from a convolutional
neural network (CNN) with a local feature encoded by the multiresolution hash
grids [2]. Subsequently, several shallow multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) predict
the attributes of each Gaussians, including color, opacity, and covariance. To
mitigate the adverse effects of transient objects on the reconstruction
process, we ffne-tune a lightweight human detection network. Once ffne-tuned,
this network generates a visibility map that efffciently generalizes to other
transient objects (such as posters, banners, and cars) with minimal need for
further adaptation. Additionally, to address the challenges posed by sky
regions in outdoor scenes, we propose an effective sky-handling technique that
incorporates a depth prior as a constraint. This allows the inffnitely distant
sky to be represented on the surface of a large-radius sky sphere,
signiffcantly reducing ffoaters caused by errors in sky reconstruction.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel relocalization method that remains robust to
changes in lighting conditions while estimating the camera pose of a given
image within the reconstructed 3DGS scene. As a result, R3GS significantly
enhances rendering ffdelity, improves both training and rendering efffciency,
and reduces storage requirements. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to baseline methods on in-the-wild datasets. The code will
be made open-source following the acceptance of the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击主要关注低分辨率（LR）图像的隐蔽性，而忽略了HR图像的隐蔽性，容易被用户检测到异常数据。

Result: 实验表明，BadSR在多种模型和数据集上实现了高攻击成功率，显著影响了下游任务。

Conclusion: BadSR有效提高了后门攻击的隐蔽性和攻击效果，为SR模型的安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: With the widespread application of super-resolution (SR) in various fields,
researchers have begun to investigate its security. Previous studies have
demonstrated that SR models can also be subjected to backdoor attacks through
data poisoning, affecting downstream tasks. A backdoor SR model generates an
attacker-predefined target image when given a triggered image while producing a
normal high-resolution (HR) output for clean images. However, prior backdoor
attacks on SR models have primarily focused on the stealthiness of poisoned
low-resolution (LR) images while ignoring the stealthiness of poisoned HR
images, making it easy for users to detect anomalous data. To address this
problem, we propose BadSR, which improves the stealthiness of poisoned HR
images. The key idea of BadSR is to approximate the clean HR image and the
pre-defined target image in the feature space while ensuring that modifications
to the clean HR image remain within a constrained range. The poisoned HR images
generated by BadSR can be integrated with existing triggers. To further improve
the effectiveness of BadSR, we design an adversarially optimized trigger and a
backdoor gradient-driven poisoned sample selection method based on a genetic
algorithm. The experimental results show that BadSR achieves a high attack
success rate in various models and data sets, significantly affecting
downstream tasks.

Result: 定量和定性评估表明，该方法在控制精度和生成多样性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了对非身份属性的精确控制，同时保持了身份特征的稳定性。

Abstract: Human facial images encode a rich spectrum of information, encompassing both
stable identity-related traits and mutable attributes such as pose, expression,
and emotion. While recent advances in image generation have enabled
high-quality identity-conditional face synthesis, precise control over
non-identity attributes remains challenging, and disentangling identity from
these mutable factors is particularly difficult. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel identity-conditional diffusion model that introduces two
lightweight control modules designed to independently manipulate facial pose,
expression, and emotion without compromising identity preservation. These
modules are embedded within the cross-attention layers of the base diffusion
model, enabling precise attribute control with minimal parameter overhead.
Furthermore, our tailored training strategy, which leverages cross-attention
between the identity feature and each non-identity control feature, encourages
identity features to remain orthogonal to control signals, enhancing
controllability and diversity. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along
with perceptual user studies, demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of control accuracy over pose, expression, and emotion,
while also improving generative diversity under identity-only conditioning.

Conclusion: CEBSNet通过建模时间依赖性和增强特征提取，显著提升了变化检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Change detection, a critical task in remote sensing and computer vision, aims
to identify pixel-level differences between image pairs captured at the same
geographic area but different times. It faces numerous challenges such as
illumination variation, seasonal changes, background interference, and shooting
angles, especially with a large time gap between images. While current methods
have advanced, they often overlook temporal dependencies and overemphasize
prominent changes while ignoring subtle but equally important changes. To
address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{CEBSNet}, a novel
change-excited and background-suppressed network with temporal dependency
modeling for change detection. During the feature extraction, we utilize a
simple Channel Swap Module (CSM) to model temporal dependency, reducing
differences and noise. The Feature Excitation and Suppression Module (FESM) is
developed to capture both obvious and subtle changes, maintaining the integrity
of change regions. Additionally, we design a Pyramid-Aware Spatial-Channel
Attention module (PASCA) to enhance the ability to detect change regions at
different sizes and focus on critical regions. We conduct extensive experiments
on three common street view datasets and two remote sensing datasets, and our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在五个数据集的三个任务上，SoftHGNN显著提升了性能，高效捕捉了高阶关联。

Conclusion: SoftHGNN通过软超边和动态关联机制，为视觉识别任务提供了一种高效且通用的框架。

Abstract: Visual recognition relies on understanding both the semantics of image tokens
and the complex interactions among them. Mainstream self-attention methods,
while effective at modeling global pair-wise relations, fail to capture
high-order associations inherent in real-world scenes and often suffer from
redundant computation. Hypergraphs extend conventional graphs by modeling
high-order interactions and offer a promising framework for addressing these
limitations. However, existing hypergraph neural networks typically rely on
static and hard hyperedge assignments, leading to excessive and redundant
hyperedges with hard binary vertex memberships that overlook the continuity of
visual semantics. To overcome these issues, we present Soft Hypergraph Neural
Networks (SoftHGNNs), which extend the methodology of hypergraph computation,
to make it truly efficient and versatile in visual recognition tasks. Our
framework introduces the concept of soft hyperedges, where each vertex is
associated with hyperedges via continuous participation weights rather than
hard binary assignments. This dynamic and differentiable association is
achieved by using the learnable hyperedge prototype. Through similarity
measurements between token features and the prototype, the model generates
semantically rich soft hyperedges. SoftHGNN then aggregates messages over soft
hyperedges to capture high-order semantics. To further enhance efficiency when
scaling up the number of soft hyperedges, we incorporate a sparse hyperedge
selection mechanism that activates only the top-k important hyperedges, along
with a load-balancing regularizer to ensure balanced hyperedge utilization.
Experimental results across three tasks on five datasets demonstrate that
SoftHGNN efficiently captures high-order associations in visual scenes,
achieving significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Leveraging the power of multimodal large language models (LLMs) offers a
promising approach to enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of morphing

work introduces the use of LLMs for differential morphing attack detection

multimodal LLMs to D-MAD using real biometric data. To effectively utilize
these models, we design Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based prompts to reduce
failure-to-answer rates and enhance the reasoning behind decisions. Our
contributions include: (1) the first application of multimodal LLMs for D-MAD
using real data subjects, (2) CoT-based prompt engineering to improve response
reliability and explainability, (3) comprehensive qualitative and quantitative
benchmarking of LLM performance using data from 54 individuals captured in
passport enrollment scenarios, and (4) comparative analysis of two multimodal
LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and Gemini providing insights into their morphing attack
detection accuracy and decision transparency. Experimental results show that
ChatGPT-4o outperforms Gemini in detection accuracy, especially against
GAN-based morphs, though both models struggle under challenging conditions.
While Gemini offers more consistent explanations, ChatGPT-4o is more resilient
but prone to a higher failure-to-answer rate.

Conclusion: KronA+是最高效的PEFT方法，SpectralGPT的微调性能甚至优于专用高光谱基础模型。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success across diverse domains,
including remote sensing (RS), thanks to their versatility and strong
generalization abilities. However, most RS foundation models are designed for
multispectral data, while hyperspectral imagery (HSI) - with its hundreds of
spectral bands - remains less explored. Fine-tuning such models for downstream
tasks is also challenging, often demanding considerable memory and storage. In
this paper, we propose an efficient framework to fine-tune SpectralGPT, a
multispectral foundation model, for hyperspectral image classification (HSIC).
We explore several Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, including
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kronecker-based adaptation (KronA), Low-Rank
Kronecker (LoKr), and the recent LoRA+, which uses distinct learning rates for
low-rank adapters scaled by a factor lambda. Inspired by LoRA+, we introduce
KronA+, which applies a similar mechanism to the Kronecker matrices. We
evaluate our approach on five datasets from different sensors, showing
competitive performance with state-of-the-art HSI models. Our full fine-tuning
(FFT) setup for SpectralGPT even outperforms a dedicated hyperspectral
foundation model on some datasets while requiring only a quarter of the
training epochs. Under the same number of epochs, KronA+ reaches similar
performance with far fewer trainable parameters - just 0.056 percent - and adds
only approximately 0.2 megabytes of storage, making it the most effective PEFT
method tested.

Abstract: The proliferation of diffusion-based deepfake technologies poses significant
risks for unauthorized and unethical facial image manipulation. While
traditional countermeasures have primarily focused on passive detection
methods, this paper introduces a novel proactive defense strategy through
adversarial attacks that preemptively protect facial images from being
exploited by diffusion-based deepfake systems. Existing adversarial protection
methods predominantly target conventional generative architectures (GANs, AEs,
VAEs) and fail to address the unique challenges presented by diffusion models,
which have become the predominant framework for high-quality facial deepfakes.
Current diffusion-specific adversarial approaches are limited by their reliance
on specific model architectures and weights, rendering them ineffective against
the diverse landscape of diffusion-based deepfake implementations.
Additionally, they typically employ global perturbation strategies that
inadequately address the region-specific nature of facial manipulation in
deepfakes.

Conclusion: 该方法有助于提升自动驾驶车辆对弱势道路使用者的检测能力。

Abstract: Road safety is a critical challenge, particularly for cyclists, who are among
the most vulnerable road users. This study aims to enhance road safety by
proposing a novel benchmark for bicycle occlusion level classification using
advanced computer vision techniques. Utilizing a parts-based detection model,
images are annotated and processed through a custom image detection pipeline. A
novel method of bicycle occlusion level is proposed to objectively quantify the
visibility and occlusion level of bicycle semantic parts. The findings indicate
that the model robustly quantifies the visibility and occlusion level of
bicycles, a significant improvement over the subjective methods used by the
current state of the art. Widespread use of the proposed methodology will
facilitate the accurate performance reporting of cyclist detection algorithms
for occluded cyclists, informing the development of more robust vulnerable road
user detection methods for autonomous vehicles.

*Dasol Choi,Seunghyun Lee,Youngsook Song*

TLDR: 论文提出VERI数据集，评估14种视觉语言模型在安全关键场景中的表现，发现模型存在系统性过度反应问题，误将安全场景识别为危险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉语言模型在安全关键场景中的可靠性，发现其存在过度反应问题，亟需改进。

Method: 使用VERI数据集（200张图像，100对对比图像），通过两阶段协议（风险识别和应急响应）评估14种模型。

Result: 模型在识别真实紧急情况时表现良好（70-100%成功率），但误报率高达31-96%，且所有模型在10种场景中均失败。

Conclusion: 模型规模增加无法解决过度反应问题，需针对性改进视觉误导场景中的上下文安全评估。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
understanding visual content, but their reliability in safety-critical contexts
remains under-explored. We introduce VERI (Visual Emergency Recognition
Dataset), a carefully designed diagnostic benchmark of 200 images (100
contrastive pairs). Each emergency scene is matched with a visually similar but
safe counterpart through multi-stage human verification and iterative
refinement. Using a two-stage protocol - risk identification and emergency
response - we evaluate 14 VLMs (2B-124B parameters) across medical emergencies,
accidents, and natural disasters. Our analysis reveals a systematic
overreaction problem: models excel at identifying real emergencies (70-100
percent success rate) but suffer from an alarming rate of false alarms,
misidentifying 31-96 percent of safe situations as dangerous, with 10 scenarios
failed by all models regardless of scale. This "better-safe-than-sorry" bias
manifests primarily through contextual overinterpretation (88-93 percent of
errors), challenging VLMs' reliability for safety applications. These findings
highlight persistent limitations that are not resolved by increasing model
scale, motivating targeted approaches for improving contextual safety
assessment in visually misleading scenarios.

Result: 系统在零样本3D实例检索、分割和检测任务中表现优异，支持对未见物体的推理和自然语言查询。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂3D环境的实时语义理解提供了通用解决方案，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Mapping and understanding complex 3D environments is fundamental to how
autonomous systems perceive and interact with the physical world, requiring
both precise geometric reconstruction and rich semantic comprehension. While
existing 3D semantic mapping systems excel at reconstructing and identifying
predefined object instances, they lack the flexibility to efficiently build
semantic maps with open-vocabulary during online operation. Although recent
vision-language models have enabled open-vocabulary object recognition in 2D
images, they haven't yet bridged the gap to 3D spatial understanding. The
critical challenge lies in developing a training-free unified system that can
simultaneously construct accurate 3D maps while maintaining semantic
consistency and supporting natural language interactions in real time. In this
paper, we develop a zero-shot framework that seamlessly integrates
GPU-accelerated geometric reconstruction with open-vocabulary vision-language
models through online instance-level semantic embedding fusion, guided by
hierarchical object association with spatial indexing. Our training-free system
achieves superior performance through incremental processing and unified
geometric-semantic updates, while robustly handling 2D segmentation
inconsistencies. The proposed general-purpose 3D scene understanding framework
can be used for various tasks including zero-shot 3D instance retrieval,
segmentation, and object detection to reason about previously unseen objects
and interpret natural language queries. The project page is available at

Abstract: We present the P$^3$ dataset, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for building

aerial imagery, and vectorized 2D building outlines, collected across three
continents. The dataset contains over 10 billion LiDAR points with
decimeter-level accuracy and RGB images at a ground sampling distance of 25

for predicting building polygons, both in hybrid and end-to-end learning
frameworks. Moreover, fusing aerial LiDAR and imagery further improves accuracy

Method: 采用两层模型：表达性模板几何层和3D高斯外观层，通过粗到细优化和多视角视频恢复参数，并使用解耦的高斯模型分别建模身体和面部。

Result: EVA在渲染质量和表达性上超越了现有方法，验证了其在高保真全身化身创建中的有效性。

Conclusion: EVA为完全可驱动的数字人类模型提供了重要进展，能够逼真地复制人类几何和外观。

Abstract: With recent advancements in neural rendering and motion capture algorithms,
remarkable progress has been made in photorealistic human avatar modeling,
unlocking immense potential for applications in virtual reality, augmented
reality, remote communication, and industries such as gaming, film, and
medicine. However, existing methods fail to provide complete, faithful, and
expressive control over human avatars due to their entangled representation of
facial expressions and body movements. In this work, we introduce Expressive
Virtual Avatars (EVA), an actor-specific, fully controllable, and expressive
human avatar framework that achieves high-fidelity, lifelike renderings in real
time while enabling independent control of facial expressions, body movements,
and hand gestures. Specifically, our approach designs the human avatar as a
two-layer model: an expressive template geometry layer and a 3D Gaussian
appearance layer. First, we present an expressive template tracking algorithm
that leverages coarse-to-fine optimization to accurately recover body motions,
facial expressions, and non-rigid deformation parameters from multi-view
videos. Next, we propose a novel decoupled 3D Gaussian appearance model
designed to effectively disentangle body and facial appearance. Unlike unified
Gaussian estimation approaches, our method employs two specialized and
independent modules to model the body and face separately. Experimental results
demonstrate that EVA surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of rendering
quality and expressiveness, validating its effectiveness in creating full-body
avatars. This work represents a significant advancement towards fully drivable
digital human models, enabling the creation of lifelike digital avatars that
faithfully replicate human geometry and appearance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅通过添加新提示无法实现文本与视觉特征的充分对齐，限制了零样本计数模型的泛化能力。

Method: RichCount采用两阶段训练策略：1）通过前馈网络和适配器丰富文本特征，增强文本-图像相似性；2）将优化后的编码器应用于计数任务，实现跨提示和复杂图像的有效泛化。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，RichCount在零样本计数中达到最先进性能，显著提升未见类别的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RichCount通过特征对齐支持未见类别的准确计数，超越了简单的提示扩展方法。

Abstract: Expanding pre-trained zero-shot counting models to handle unseen categories
requires more than simply adding new prompts, as this approach does not achieve
the necessary alignment between text and visual features for accurate counting.
We introduce RichCount, the first framework to address these limitations,
employing a two-stage training strategy that enhances text encoding and
strengthens the model's association with objects in images. RichCount improves
zero-shot counting for unseen categories through two key objectives: (1)
enriching text features with a feed-forward network and adapter trained on
text-image similarity, thereby creating robust, aligned representations; and
(2) applying this refined encoder to counting tasks, enabling effective
generalization across diverse prompts and complex images. In this manner,
RichCount goes beyond simple prompt expansion to establish meaningful feature
alignment that supports accurate counting across novel categories. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
RichCount, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot counting and
significantly enhancing generalization to unseen categories in open-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态多分辨率VQA任务开辟了新方向，并有望应用于其他多模态领域（如医学影像）。

Abstract: The extraction of visual features is an essential step in Visual Question
Answering (VQA). Building a good visual representation of the analyzed scene is
indeed one of the essential keys for the system to be able to correctly
understand the latter in order to answer complex questions. In many fields such
as remote sensing, the visual feature extraction step could benefit
significantly from leveraging different image modalities carrying complementary
spectral, spatial and contextual information. In this work, we propose to add
multiple image modalities to VQA in the particular context of remote sensing,
leading to a novel task for the computer vision community. To this end, we
introduce a new VQA dataset, named TAMMI (Text and Multi-Modal Imagery) with
diverse questions on scenes described by three different modalities (very high
resolution RGB, multi-spectral imaging data and synthetic aperture radar).
Thanks to an automated pipeline, this dataset can be easily extended according
to experimental needs. We also propose the MM-RSVQA (Multi-modal
Multi-resolution Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering) model, based on
VisualBERT, a vision-language transformer, to effectively combine the multiple
image modalities and text through a trainable fusion process. A preliminary
experimental study shows promising results of our methodology on this
challenging dataset, with an accuracy of 65.56% on the targeted VQA task. This
pioneering work paves the way for the community to a new multi-modal
multi-resolution VQA task that can be applied in other imaging domains (such as
medical imaging) where multi-modality can enrich the visual representation of a
scene. The dataset and code are available at https://tammi.sylvainlobry.com/.

Abstract: Machine learning and computer vision methods have a major impact on the study
of natural animal behavior, as they enable the (semi-)automatic analysis of
vast amounts of video data. Mice are the standard mammalian model system in
most research fields, but the datasets available today to refine such methods
focus either on simple or social behaviors. In this work, we present a video
dataset of individual mice solving complex mechanical puzzles, so-called
lockboxes. The more than 110 hours of total playtime show their behavior
recorded from three different perspectives. As a benchmark for frame-level
action classification methods, we provide human-annotated labels for all videos
of two different mice, that equal 13% of our dataset. Our keypoint (pose)
tracking-based action classification framework illustrates the challenges of
automated labeling of fine-grained behaviors, such as the manipulation of
objects. We hope that our work will help accelerate the advancement of
automated action and behavior classification in the computational neuroscience

Motivation: Vision Transformers的高计算和资源需求是主要挑战，而传统的MoE方法需要昂贵的重新训练或从头训练。

Method: 分两阶段从预训练模型的MLP层提取专家子网络：聚类输出激活以识别模式，然后提取对应子网络。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k任务中，提取的专家子网络无需微调即可表现良好，微调后恢复98%性能，同时减少36% MACs和32%模型大小。

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了Vision Transformers的计算和资源需求，同时保持了高性能，为高效模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have emerged as the state-of-the-art models in various
Computer Vision tasks, but their high computational and resource demands pose
significant challenges. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can make these models
more efficient, they often require costly retraining or even training from
scratch. Recent developments aim to reduce these computational costs by
leveraging pretrained networks. These have been shown to produce sparse
activation patterns in the Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) of the encoder
blocks, allowing for conditional activation of only relevant subnetworks for
each sample. Building on this idea, we propose a new method to construct MoE
variants from pretrained models. Our approach extracts expert subnetworks from
the model's MLP layers post-training in two phases. First, we cluster output
activations to identify distinct activation patterns. In the second phase, we
use these clusters to extract the corresponding subnetworks responsible for
producing them. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we demonstrate that these
extracted experts can perform surprisingly well out of the box and require only
minimal fine-tuning to regain 98% of the original performance, all while
reducing MACs and model size, by up to 36% and 32% respectively.

Motivation: 现有MVLMs在干净数据集上表现优异，但在实际临床图像中的噪声和失真条件下性能未经验证，亟需评估和改进其鲁棒性。

Method: 引入MediMeta-C和MedMNIST-C作为评估基准，并提出RobustMedCLIP，通过少样本调优和低秩适应提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明现有MVLMs在噪声条件下性能显著下降，而RobustMedCLIP通过少样本调优和低秩适应显著提升了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多样化训练和鲁棒适应策略的必要性，低秩适应与少样本调优结合能有效提升模型鲁棒性并保持泛化能力。

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MVLMs) have achieved par excellence
generalization in medical image analysis, yet their performance under noisy,
corrupted conditions remains largely untested. Clinical imaging is inherently
susceptible to acquisition artifacts and noise; however, existing evaluations
predominantly assess generally clean datasets, overlooking robustness -- i.e.,
the model's ability to perform under real-world distortions. To address this
gap, we first introduce MediMeta-C, a corruption benchmark that systematically
applies several perturbations across multiple medical imaging datasets.
Combined with MedMNIST-C, this establishes a comprehensive robustness
evaluation framework for MVLMs. We further propose RobustMedCLIP, a visual
encoder adaptation of a pretrained MVLM that incorporates few-shot tuning to
enhance resilience against corruptions. Through extensive experiments, we
benchmark 5 major MVLMs across 5 medical imaging modalities, revealing that
existing models exhibit severe degradation under corruption and struggle with
domain-modality tradeoffs. Our findings highlight the necessity of diverse
training and robust adaptation strategies, demonstrating that efficient
low-rank adaptation when paired with few-shot tuning, improves robustness while
preserving generalization across modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在时间因果推理（如物体状态变化）上的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 设计TimeCausality基准，评估VLMs在时间维度上的因果推理能力。

Result: 当前开源VLMs在TimeCausality上表现显著落后于闭源模型（如GPT-4o），且GPT-4o在此任务上的表现也明显下降。

Conclusion: 需将时间因果推理纳入VLMs的评估与开发，这对开源VLM社区是一个重要挑战。

Abstract: Reasoning about temporal causality, particularly irreversible transformations
of objects governed by real-world knowledge (e.g., fruit decay and human
aging), is a fundamental aspect of human visual understanding. Unlike temporal
perception based on simple event sequences, this form of reasoning requires a
deeper comprehension of how object states change over time. Although the
current powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, their capacity to reason about
temporal causality remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
\textbf{TimeCausality}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the
causal reasoning ability of VLMs in the temporal dimension. Based on our
TimeCausality, we find that while the current SOTA open-source VLMs have
achieved performance levels comparable to closed-source models like GPT-4o on
various standard visual question answering tasks, they fall significantly
behind on our benchmark compared with their closed-source competitors.
Furthermore, even GPT-4o exhibits a marked drop in performance on TimeCausality
compared to its results on other tasks. These findings underscore the critical
need to incorporate temporal causality into the evaluation and development of
VLMs, and they highlight an important challenge for the open-source VLM
community moving forward. Code and Data are available at

Conclusion: CoF方法有效提升了视觉语言模型的多模态推理能力，有助于实际应用中的高效部署。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
variety of computer vision tasks. However, the multimodal reasoning capability
has not been fully explored in existing models. In this paper, we propose a
Chain-of-Focus (CoF) method that allows VLMs to perform adaptive focusing and
zooming in on key image regions based on obtained visual cues and the given
questions, achieving efficient multimodal reasoning. To enable this CoF
capability, we present a two-stage training pipeline, including supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we
construct the MM-CoF dataset, comprising 3K samples derived from a visual agent
designed to adaptively identify key regions to solve visual tasks with
different image resolutions and questions. We use MM-CoF to fine-tune the
Qwen2.5-VL model for cold start. In the RL stage, we leverage the outcome
accuracies and formats as rewards to update the Qwen2.5-VL model, enabling
further refining the search and reasoning strategy of models without human
priors. Our model achieves significant improvements on multiple benchmarks. On
the V* benchmark that requires strong visual reasoning capability, our model
outperforms existing VLMs by 5% among 8 image resolutions ranging from 224 to
4K, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed CoF method and facilitating
the more efficient deployment of VLMs in practical applications.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了人工注释依赖问题，为手语翻译提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to map sign language videos to spoken
language text. A common approach relies on gloss annotations as an intermediate
representation, decomposing SLT into two sub-tasks: video-to-gloss recognition
and gloss-to-text translation. While effective, this paradigm depends on
expert-annotated gloss labels, which are costly and rarely available in
existing datasets, limiting its scalability. To address this challenge, we
propose a gloss-free pseudo gloss generation framework that eliminates the need
for human-annotated glosses while preserving the structured intermediate
representation. Specifically, we prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) with a few
example text-gloss pairs using in-context learning to produce draft sign
glosses from spoken language text. To enhance the correspondence between
LLM-generated pseudo glosses and the sign sequences in video, we correct the
ordering in the pseudo glosses for better alignment via a weakly supervised
learning process. This reordering facilitates the incorporation of auxiliary
alignment objectives, and allows for the use of efficient supervision via a
Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. We train our SLT mode, which
consists of a vision encoder and a translator, through a three-stage pipeline,
which progressively narrows the modality gap between sign language and spoken
language. Despite its simplicity, our approach outperforms previous
state-of-the-art gloss-free frameworks on two SLT benchmarks and achieves
competitive results compared to gloss-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）获取成本高，通过RGB图像进行光谱重建可以降低成本。现有方法通常一次性整合全光谱信息，效果有限。

Method: FRN采用递归调用原子重建模块的渐进式方法，利用相邻波段信息逐步预测下一波长，并设计了波段感知状态空间模型以减少干扰。

Result: 在多个数据集上，FRN在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FRN通过分形递归和波段感知策略，实现了高效且准确的光谱重建。

Abstract: Generating hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB images through spectral
reconstruction can significantly reduce the cost of HSI acquisition. In this
paper, we propose a Fractal-Based Recursive Spectral Reconstruction Network
(FRN), which differs from existing paradigms that attempt to directly integrate
the full-spectrum information from the R, G, and B channels in a one-shot
manner. Instead, it treats spectral reconstruction as a progressive process,
predicting from broad to narrow bands or employing a coarse-to-fine approach
for predicting the next wavelength. Inspired by fractals in mathematics, FRN
establishes a novel spectral reconstruction paradigm by recursively invoking an
atomic reconstruction module. In each invocation, only the spectral information
from neighboring bands is used to provide clues for the generation of the image
at the next wavelength, which follows the low-rank property of spectral data.
Moreover, we design a band-aware state space model that employs a
pixel-differentiated scanning strategy at different stages of the generation
process, further suppressing interference from low-correlation regions caused
by reflectance differences. Through extensive experimentation across different
datasets, FRN achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

develop new architectures, octic ViTs, that use octic-equivariant layers and
put them to the test on both supervised and self-supervised learning. Through
extensive experiments on DeiT-III and DINOv2 training on ImageNet-1K, we show
that octic ViTs yield more computationally efficient networks while also
improving performance. In particular, we achieve approximately 40% reduction in
FLOPs for ViT-H while simultaneously improving both classification and
segmentation results.

*Ziqiang Xu,Qi Dai,Tian Xie,Yifan Yang,Kai Qiu,DongDong Chen,Zuxuan Wu,Chong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: ViaRL 是一个基于规则强化学习的框架，用于优化视频理解中的帧选择，无需昂贵标注，性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解方法依赖启发式或伪标注，成本高且扩展性差，ViaRL 旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用迭代放大的策略，通过强化学习训练帧选择器，以下游模型答案准确率为奖励信号。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，特别是 Needle QA 上提升近 15%。

Conclusion: ViaRL 展示了高效、可扩展的视频理解能力，适用于多样化任务。

Abstract: Video understanding is inherently intention-driven-humans naturally focus on
relevant frames based on their goals. Recent advancements in multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have enabled flexible query-driven reasoning; however,
video-based frameworks like Video Chain-of-Thought lack direct training signals
to effectively identify relevant frames. Current approaches often rely on
heuristic methods or pseudo-label supervised annotations, which are both costly
and limited in scalability across diverse scenarios. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce ViaRL, the first framework to leverage rule-based
reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing frame selection in intention-driven
video understanding. An iterated amplification strategy is adopted to perform
alternating cyclic training in the video CoT system, where each component
undergoes iterative cycles of refinement to improve its capabilities. ViaRL
utilizes the answer accuracy of a downstream model as a reward signal to train
a frame selector through trial-and-error, eliminating the need for expensive
annotations while closely aligning with human-like learning processes.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, including VideoMME,
LVBench, and MLVU, demonstrate that ViaRL consistently delivers superior
temporal grounding performance and robust generalization across diverse video
understanding tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability. Notably,
ViaRL achieves a nearly 15\% improvement on Needle QA, a subset of MLVU, which
is required to search a specific needle within a long video and regarded as one
of the most suitable benchmarks for evaluating temporal grounding.

Conclusion: 研究推动了扩散模型内容安全的理解，为未来研究和开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have gained widespread application across
various domains, demonstrating remarkable creative potential. However, the
strong generalization capabilities of diffusion models can inadvertently lead
to the generation of not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, posing significant risks
to their safe deployment. While several concept erasure methods have been
proposed to mitigate the issue associated with NSFW content, a comprehensive
evaluation of their effectiveness across various scenarios remains absent. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a full-pipeline toolkit specifically designed for
concept erasure and conduct the first systematic study of NSFW concept erasure
methods. By examining the interplay between the underlying mechanisms and
empirical observations, we provide in-depth insights and practical guidance for
the effective application of concept erasure methods in various real-world
scenarios, with the aim of advancing the understanding of content safety in
diffusion models and establishing a solid foundation for future research and
development in this critical area.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为Pura的高效隐私保护人脸识别方案，通过阈值Paillier加密系统和非交互式架构保护隐私，并支持加密数据上的高效识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统隐私保护人脸识别方案既无法完全解决隐私问题，效率也不足。

Method: 采用阈值Paillier加密系统，设计了一套安全计算协议，并引入并行计算机制提升性能。

Result: Pura在隐私保护方面表现优异，识别速度比现有技术快16倍。

Conclusion: Pura是一种高效且隐私保护充分的人脸识别解决方案。

Abstract: Face recognition is an effective technology for identifying a target person
by facial images. However, sensitive facial images raises privacy concerns.
Although privacy-preserving face recognition is one of potential solutions,
this solution neither fully addresses the privacy concerns nor is efficient
enough. To this end, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving solution for
face recognition, named Pura, which sufficiently protects facial privacy and
supports face recognition over encrypted data efficiently. Specifically, we
propose a privacy-preserving and non-interactive architecture for face
recognition through the threshold Paillier cryptosystem. Additionally, we
carefully design a suite of underlying secure computing protocols to enable
efficient operations of face recognition over encrypted data directly.
Furthermore, we introduce a parallel computing mechanism to enhance the
performance of the proposed secure computing protocols. Privacy analysis
demonstrates that Pura fully safeguards personal facial privacy. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that Pura achieves recognition speeds up to 16 times
faster than the state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 理解创作者的误导意图对多模态虚假信息检测（MMD）至关重要，但目前缺乏对此的系统研究。

Method: 通过建模创作者意图（期望影响和执行计划），构建了包含12,000个图像-标题对的数据集，并评估了14种视觉语言模型在三个意图相关任务上的表现。

Result: 现有模型在识别误导意图时依赖表面线索，表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究强调了意图感知建模在MMD中的重要性，并为开发能深入推理多模态虚假信息的系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The real-world impact of misinformation stems from the underlying misleading
narratives that creators seek to convey. As such, interpreting misleading
creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD)
systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce
an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by
explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired
influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct
DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs
aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both
misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and
textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks:
(1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3)
creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs
fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues
such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic
authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware
modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of
deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB数据在低光照和遮挡条件下表现不佳，而融合热辐射数据可以提升性能，但如何有效融合多模态特征仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出SGFNet网络，通过光谱视角将多模态特征分为低频（场景上下文）和高频（模态细节），并显式建模高频特征的交互。

Result: SGFNet在MFNet和PST900数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过光谱视角融合RGB和热辐射数据，SGFNet显著提升了语义分割的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relying solely on RGB data often struggles in
challenging conditions such as low illumination and obscured views, limiting
its reliability in critical applications like autonomous driving. To address
this, integrating additional thermal radiation data with RGB images
demonstrates enhanced performance and robustness. However, how to effectively
reconcile the modality discrepancies and fuse the RGB and thermal features
remains a well-known challenge. In this work, we address this challenge from a
novel spectral perspective. We observe that the multi-modal features can be
categorized into two spectral components: low-frequency features that provide
broad scene context, including color variations and smooth areas, and
high-frequency features that capture modality-specific details such as edges
and textures. Inspired by this, we propose the Spectral-aware Global Fusion
Network (SGFNet) to effectively enhance and fuse the multi-modal features by
explicitly modeling the interactions between the high-frequency,
modality-specific features. Our experimental results demonstrate that SGFNet
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the MFNet and PST900 datasets.

TLDR: 提出了一种Squeeze-and-Recalibrate（SR）块，用于改进少样本多实例学习（MIL）模型，减少参数和计算成本，同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中专家标注稀缺、少样本学习过拟合和特征表征不足的问题，同时避免现有方法的复杂预处理和高计算成本。

Method: SR块包含低秩可训练矩阵（压缩路径）和冻结随机重校准矩阵，减少参数并保持几何结构。

Result: SR-MIL模型在实验中表现优于现有方法，参数更少且无需架构修改。

Conclusion: SR块为MIL模型提供了一种高效且性能优越的改进方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced computational pathology but expert annotations
remain scarce. Few-shot learning mitigates annotation burdens yet suffers from
overfitting and discriminative feature mischaracterization. In addition, the
current few-shot multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches leverage
pretrained vision-language models to alleviate these issues, but at the cost of
complex preprocessing and high computational cost. We propose a
Squeeze-and-Recalibrate (SR) block, a drop-in replacement for linear layers in
MIL models to address these challenges. The SR block comprises two core
components: a pair of low-rank trainable matrices (squeeze pathway, SP) that
reduces parameter count and imposes a bottleneck to prevent spurious feature
learning, and a frozen random recalibration matrix that preserves geometric
structure, diversifies feature directions, and redefines the optimization
objective for the SP. We provide theoretical guarantees that the SR block can
approximate any linear mapping to arbitrary precision, thereby ensuring that
the performance of a standard MIL model serves as a lower bound for its
SR-enhanced counterpart. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SR-MIL
models consistently outperform prior methods while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and no architectural changes.

Method: 提出PromptMargin方法，包括选择性增强策略和新型多模态边界正则化器，以优化文本和视觉提示，增强类别区分能力。

Result: 在15个目标基准数据集上的实验表明，PromptMargin在分布偏移情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PromptMargin能有效适应预训练视觉语言模型到分布差异较大的目标数据集，提升性能。

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language foundation models like CLIP and ALIGN, which are
pre-trained on large-scale data have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization
to diverse datasets with different classes and even domains. In this work, we
take a step further and analyze whether these models can be adapted to target
datasets having very different distributions and classes compared to what these
models have been trained on, using only a few labeled examples from the target
dataset. In such scenarios, finetuning large pretrained models is challenging
due to problems of overfitting as well as loss of generalization, and has not
been well explored in prior literature. Since, the pre-training data of such
models are unavailable, it is difficult to comprehend the performance on
various downstream datasets. First, we try to answer the question: Given a
target dataset with a few labelled examples, can we estimate whether further
fine-tuning can enhance the performance compared to zero-shot evaluation? by
analyzing the common vision-language embedding space. Based on the analysis, we
propose a novel prompt-tuning method, PromptMargin for adapting such
large-scale VLMs directly on the few target samples. PromptMargin effectively
tunes the text as well as visual prompts for this task, and has two main
modules: 1) Firstly, we use a selective augmentation strategy to complement the
few training samples in each task; 2) Additionally, to ensure robust training
in the presence of unfamiliar class names, we increase the inter-class margin
for improved class discrimination using a novel Multimodal Margin Regularizer.
Extensive experiments and analysis across fifteen target benchmark datasets,
with varying degrees of distribution shifts from natural images, shows the
effectiveness of the proposed framework over the existing state-of-the-art
approaches applied to this setting. github.com/debarshigit/PromptMargin.

Result: 不同形式的视觉思维对MCoT改进效果不同，视觉思维作为中介促进视觉信息传递。

Conclusion: 视觉思维为未来MCoT研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in
multimodal tasks, with multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) further enhancing
performance and interpretability. Recent MCoT methods fall into two categories:
(i) Textual-MCoT (T-MCoT), which takes multimodal input and produces textual
output; and (ii) Interleaved-MCoT (I-MCoT), which generates interleaved
image-text outputs. Despite advances in both approaches, the mechanisms driving
these improvements are not fully understood. To fill this gap, we first reveal
that MCoT boosts LVLMs by incorporating visual thoughts, which convey image
information to the reasoning process regardless of the MCoT format, depending
only on clarity and conciseness of expression. Furthermore, to explore visual
thoughts systematically, we define four distinct forms of visual thought
expressions and analyze them comprehensively. Our findings demonstrate that
these forms differ in clarity and conciseness, yielding varying levels of MCoT
improvement. Additionally, we explore the internal nature of visual thoughts,
finding that visual thoughts serve as intermediaries between the input image
and reasoning to deeper transformer layers, enabling more advanced visual
information transmission. We hope that the visual thoughts can inspire further
breakthroughs for future MCoT research.

Abstract: To overcome the constraints of the underwater environment and improve the
accuracy and robustness of underwater target detection models, this paper
develops a specialized dataset for underwater target detection and proposes an
efficient algorithm for underwater multi-target detection. A self-supervised
learning based on the SimSiam structure is employed for the pre-training of
underwater target detection network. To address the problems of low detection
accuracy caused by low contrast, mutual occlusion and dense distribution of
underwater targets in underwater object detection, a detection model suitable
for underwater target detection is proposed by introducing deformable
convolution and dilated convolution. The proposed detection model can obtain
more effective information by increasing the receptive field. In addition, the
regression loss function EIoU is introduced, which improves model performance
by separately calculating the width and height losses of the predicted box.
Experiment results show that the accuracy of the underwater target detection
has been improved by the proposed detector.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推动了合成植物生成技术的发展，还为3D表型分析提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Recent years have seen substantial improvements in the ability to generate
synthetic 3D objects using AI. However, generating complex 3D objects, such as
plants, remains a considerable challenge. Current generative 3D models struggle
with plant generation compared to general objects, limiting their usability in
plant analysis tools, which require fine detail and accurate geometry. We
introduce PlantDreamer, a novel approach to 3D synthetic plant generation,
which can achieve greater levels of realism for complex plant geometry and
textures than available text-to-3D models. To achieve this, our new generation
pipeline leverages a depth ControlNet, fine-tuned Low-Rank Adaptation and an
adaptable Gaussian culling algorithm, which directly improve textural realism
and geometric integrity of generated 3D plant models. Additionally,
PlantDreamer enables both purely synthetic plant generation, by leveraging
L-System-generated meshes, and the enhancement of real-world plant point clouds
by converting them into 3D Gaussian Splats. We evaluate our approach by
comparing its outputs with state-of-the-art text-to-3D models, demonstrating
that PlantDreamer outperforms existing methods in producing high-fidelity
synthetic plants. Our results indicate that our approach not only advances
synthetic plant generation, but also facilitates the upgrading of legacy point
cloud datasets, making it a valuable tool for 3D phenotyping applications.

Result: 实现13倍压缩（平均61标记/帧），在多个数据集上表现优异（如VideoMME 62.0%）。

Conclusion: Clapper显著提升视频理解效率，适用于短长视频任务。

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse video understanding applications. Designing VLMs
for video inputs requires effectively modeling the temporal dimension (i.e.
capturing dependencies across frames) and balancing the processing of short and
long videos. Specifically, short videos demand preservation of fine-grained
details, whereas long videos require strategic compression of visual
information to handle extensive temporal contexts efficiently. However, our
empirical analysis reveals a critical limitation: most existing VLMs suffer
severe performance degradation in long video understanding tasks when
compressing visual tokens below a quarter of their original visual tokens. To
enable more effective modeling of both short and long video inputs, we propose
Clapper, a method that utilizes a slow-fast strategy for video representation
and introduces a novel module named TimePerceiver for efficient
temporal-spatial encoding within existing VLM backbones. By using our method,
we achieves 13x compression of visual tokens per frame (averaging 61
tokens/frame) without compromising QA accuracy. In our experiments, Clapper
achieves 62.0% on VideoMME, 69.8% on MLVU, and 67.4% on TempCompass, all with
fewer than 6,000 visual tokens per video. The code will be publicly available

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the main approach to analyzing flow
field. However, the convergence and accuracy depend largely on mathematical
models of flow, numerical methods, and time consumption. Deep learning-based
analysis of flow filed provides an alternative. For the task of flow field
prediction, an improved Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Con-vLSTM) Neural
Network is proposed as the baseline network in consideration of the temporal
and spatial characteristics of flow field. Combining dynamic mesh technology
and User-Defined Function (UDF), numerical simulations of flow around a
circular cylinder were conducted. Flow field snapshots were used to sample data
from the cylinder's wake region at different time instants, constructing a flow
field dataset with sufficient volume and rich flow state var-iations. Residual
networks and attention mechanisms are combined with the standard ConvLSTM
model. Compared with the standard ConvLSTM model, the results demonstrate that
the improved ConvLSTM model can extract more temporal and spatial features
while having fewer parameters and shorter train-ing time.

Abstract: 3D semantic segmentation plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving and road
infrastructure analysis, yet state-of-the-art 3D models are prone to severe
domain shift when deployed across different datasets. We propose a novel
multi-view projection framework that excels in both domain generalization (DG)
and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our approach first aligns Lidar scans
into coherent 3D scenes and renders them from multiple virtual camera poses to
create a large-scale synthetic 2D dataset (PC2D). We then use it to train a 2D
segmentation model in-domain. During inference, the model processes hundreds of
views per scene; the resulting logits are back-projected to 3D with an
occlusion-aware voting scheme to generate final point-wise labels. Our
framework is modular and enables extensive exploration of key design
parameters, such as view generation optimization (VGO), visualization modality
optimization (MODO), and 2D model choice. We evaluate on the nuScenes and
SemanticKITTI datasets under both the DG and UDA settings. We achieve
state-of-the-art results in UDA and close to state-of-the-art in DG, with
particularly large gains on large, static classes. Our code and dataset

Conclusion: TinyDrive在轻量化的同时实现了高性能，适用于资源受限的自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) employed for visual question-answering (VQA) in
autonomous driving often require substantial computational resources that pose
a challenge for their deployment in resource-constrained vehicles. To address
this challenge, we introduce TinyDrive, a lightweight yet effective VLM for
multi-view VQA in driving scenarios. Our model comprises two key components
including a multiscale vision encoder and a dual-level prioritization mechanism
for tokens and sequences. The multiscale encoder facilitates the processing of
multi-view images at diverse resolutions through scale injection and
cross-scale gating to generate enhanced visual representations. At the token
level, we design a token routing mechanism that dynamically selects and process
the most informative tokens based on learned importance scores. At the sequence
level, we propose integrating normalized loss, uncertainty estimates, and a
diversity metric to formulate sequence scores that rank and preserve samples
within a sequence priority buffer. Samples with higher scores are more
frequently selected for training. TinyDrive is first evaluated on our
custom-curated VQA dataset, and it is subsequently tested on the public DriveLM
benchmark, where it achieves state-of-the-art language understanding
performance. Notably, it achieves relative improvements of 11.1% and 35.4% in
BLEU-4 and METEOR scores, respectively, despite having a significantly smaller

Conclusion: AHNPL通过改进负样本生成和对比学习策略，有效提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are essential for multimodal tasks, especially
compositional reasoning (CR) tasks, which require distinguishing fine-grained
semantic differences between visual and textual embeddings. However, existing
methods primarily fine-tune the model by generating text-based hard negative
samples, neglecting the importance of image-based negative samples, which
results in insufficient training of the visual encoder and ultimately impacts
the overall performance of the model. Moreover, negative samples are typically
treated uniformly, without considering their difficulty levels, and the
alignment of positive samples is insufficient, which leads to challenges in
aligning difficult sample pairs. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Hard Negative Perturbation Learning (AHNPL). AHNPL translates text-based hard
negatives into the visual domain to generate semantically disturbed image-based
negatives for training the model, thereby enhancing its overall performance.
AHNPL also introduces a contrastive learning approach using a multimodal hard
negative loss to improve the model's discrimination of hard negatives within
each modality and a dynamic margin loss that adjusts the contrastive margin
according to sample difficulty to enhance the distinction of challenging sample
pairs. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method
effectively boosts VLMs' performance on complex CR tasks. The source code is

*Hua Li,Shijie Lian,Zhiyuan Li,Runmin Cong,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种针对水下实例分割的高效模型UWSAM，通过知识蒸馏和自动提示生成，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在水下实例分割任务中表现受限，且计算需求高，作者提出UWSAM以解决这些问题。

Method: 使用Mask GAT-based知识蒸馏方法（MG-UKD）将SAM ViT-Huge的知识迁移到ViT-Small，并设计端到端水下提示生成器（EUPG）自动生成提示。

Result: 实验表明，UWSAM在多个水下实例数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UWSAM通过高效知识蒸馏和自动提示生成，为水下实例分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With recent breakthroughs in large-scale modeling, the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in a variety of visual
applications. However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and
its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance
segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further
hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we
propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which
includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we
introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate
segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from
the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the
Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective
visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater
Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater
prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts,
thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for
efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model
is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets. Datasets and
codes are available at https://github.com/LiamLian0727/UIIS10K.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模预训练视觉模型在专业领域表现不佳，需适应特定领域的数据分布。

Method: 提出VP Lab框架，结合E-PEFT技术，实现参数和数据高效的自适应。

Result: 在多种技术数据集上，仅用5张验证图像，mIoU性能提升50%。

Conclusion: VP Lab为快速、高效、交互式模型部署在新领域树立了新范式。

Abstract: Large-scale pretrained vision backbones have transformed computer vision by
providing powerful feature extractors that enable various downstream tasks,
including training-free approaches like visual prompting for semantic
segmentation. Despite their success in generic scenarios, these models often
fall short when applied to specialized technical domains where the visual
features differ significantly from their training distribution. To bridge this
gap, we introduce VP Lab, a comprehensive iterative framework that enhances
visual prompting for robust segmentation model development. At the core of VP
Lab lies E-PEFT, a novel ensemble of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques
specifically designed to adapt our visual prompting pipeline to specific
domains in a manner that is both parameter- and data-efficient. Our approach
not only surpasses the state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient fine-tuning for
the Segment Anything Model (SAM), but also facilitates an interactive,
near-real-time loop, allowing users to observe progressively improving results
as they experiment within the framework. By integrating E-PEFT with visual
prompting, we demonstrate a remarkable 50\% increase in semantic segmentation
mIoU performance across various technical datasets using only 5 validated
images, establishing a new paradigm for fast, efficient, and interactive model
deployment in new, challenging domains. This work comes in the form of a
demonstration.

Motivation: 现有基准测试通常以任务为导向，无法评估低层次感知能力对高层次推理的协同效应，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 构建Lens基准测试，包含八项任务和12个日常场景，分为感知、理解和推理三个层次，每张图像均配备丰富注释。

Conclusion: Lens为MLLMs提供了更全面的评估框架，揭示了当前模型在复杂推理任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant advances
in integrating visual and linguistic information, yet their ability to reason
about complex and real-world scenarios remains limited. The existing benchmarks
are usually constructed in the task-oriented manner without guarantee that
different task samples come from the same data distribution, thus they often
fall short in evaluating the synergistic effects of lower-level perceptual
capabilities on higher-order reasoning. To lift this limitation, we contribute
Lens, a multi-level benchmark with 3.4K contemporary images and 60K+
human-authored questions covering eight tasks and 12 daily scenarios, forming
three progressive task tiers, i.e., perception, understanding, and reasoning.
One feature is that each image is equipped with rich annotations for all tasks.
Thus, this dataset intrinsically supports to evaluate MLLMs to handle
image-invariable prompts, from basic perception to compositional reasoning. In
addition, our images are manully collected from the social media, in which 53%
were published later than Jan. 2025. We evaluate 15+ frontier MLLMs such as
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, InternVL3-78B, GPT-4o and two reasoning models QVQ-72B-preview
and Kimi-VL. These models are released later than Dec. 2024, and none of them
achieve an accuracy greater than 60% in the reasoning tasks. Project page:

Conclusion: 捕捉条件对深度学习模型性能有显著影响，数据集偏差需进一步解决。

Abstract: Generalization of deep-learning-based (DL) computer vision algorithms to
various image perturbations is hard to establish and remains an active area of
research. The majority of past analyses focused on the images already captured,
whereas effects of the image formation pipeline and environment are less
studied. In this paper, we address this issue by analyzing the impact of
capture conditions, such as camera parameters and lighting, on DL model
performance on 3 vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and
visual question answering (VQA). To this end, we assess capture bias in common
vision datasets and create a new benchmark, SNAP (for $\textbf{S}$hutter speed,
ISO se$\textbf{N}$sitivity, and $\textbf{AP}$erture), consisting of images of
objects taken under controlled lighting conditions and with densely sampled
camera settings. We then evaluate a large number of DL vision models and show
the effects of capture conditions on each selected vision task. Lastly, we
conduct an experiment to establish a human baseline for the VQA task. Our
results show that computer vision datasets are significantly biased, the models
trained on this data do not reach human accuracy even on the well-exposed
images, and are susceptible to both major exposure changes and minute
variations of camera settings. Code and data can be found at

Conclusion: OMNI数据集为错颌畸形研究提供了重要资源，推动了牙科自动诊断的发展。

Abstract: Malocclusion is a major challenge in orthodontics, and its complex
presentation and diverse clinical manifestations make accurate localization and
diagnosis particularly important. Currently, one of the major shortcomings
facing the field of dental image analysis is the lack of large-scale,
accurately labeled datasets dedicated to malocclusion issues, which limits the
development of automated diagnostics in the field of dentistry and leads to a
lack of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical practice. Therefore, in
this study, we propose the Oral and Maxillofacial Natural Images (OMNI)
dataset, a novel and comprehensive dental image dataset aimed at advancing the
study of analyzing dental images for issues of malocclusion. Specifically, the
dataset contains 4166 multi-view images with 384 participants in data
collection and annotated by professional dentists. In addition, we performed a
comprehensive validation of the created OMNI dataset, including three CNN-based
methods, two Transformer-based methods, and one GNN-based method, and conducted
automated diagnostic experiments for malocclusion issues. The experimental
results show that the OMNI dataset can facilitate the automated diagnosis
research of malocclusion issues and provide a new benchmark for the research in
this field. Our OMNI dataset and baseline code are publicly available at

Conclusion: 该研究首次将局部图像编辑检测任务重新定义为视觉语言理解问题，为多模态内容真实性领域奠定了基础。

Abstract: Fine-grained edited image detection of localized edits in images is crucial
for assessing content authenticity, especially given that modern diffusion
models and image editing methods can produce highly realistic manipulations.
However, this domain faces three challenges: (1) Binary classifiers yield only
a global real-or-fake label without providing localization; (2) Traditional
computer vision methods often rely on costly pixel-level annotations; and (3)
No large-scale, high-quality dataset exists for modern image-editing detection
techniques. To address these gaps, we develop an automated data-generation
pipeline to create FragFake, the first dedicated benchmark dataset for edited
image detection, which includes high-quality images from diverse editing models
and a wide variety of edited objects. Based on FragFake, we utilize Vision
Language Models (VLMs) for the first time in the task of edited image
classification and edited region localization. Experimental results show that
fine-tuned VLMs achieve higher average Object Precision across all datasets,
significantly outperforming pretrained models. We further conduct ablation and
transferability analyses to evaluate the detectors across various
configurations and editing scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work
is the first to reformulate localized image edit detection as a vision-language
understanding task, establishing a new paradigm for the field. We anticipate
that this work will establish a solid foundation to facilitate and inspire
subsequent research endeavors in the domain of multimodal content authenticity.

Conclusion: 论文提出的JDL和LTB有助于提升场景文本检测的泛化能力，MAEDet为长尾问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Scene text detection has seen the emergence of high-performing methods that
excel on academic benchmarks. However, these detectors often fail to replicate
such success in real-world scenarios. We uncover two key factors contributing
to this discrepancy through extensive experiments. First, a \textit{Fine-tuning
Gap}, where models leverage \textit{Dataset-Specific Optimization} (DSO)
paradigm for one domain at the cost of reduced effectiveness in others, leads
to inflated performances on academic benchmarks. Second, the suboptimal
performance in practical settings is primarily attributed to the long-tailed
distribution of texts, where detectors struggle with rare and complex
categories as artistic or overlapped text. Given that the DSO paradigm might
undermine the generalization ability of models, we advocate for a
\textit{Joint-Dataset Learning} (JDL) protocol to alleviate the Fine-tuning
Gap. Additionally, an error analysis is conducted to identify three major
categories and 13 subcategories of challenges in long-tailed scene text, upon
which we propose a Long-Tailed Benchmark (LTB). LTB facilitates a comprehensive
evaluation of ability to handle a diverse range of long-tailed challenges. We
further introduce MAEDet, a self-supervised learning-based method, as a strong
baseline for LTB. The code is available at https://github.com/pd162/LTB.

Conclusion: 该方法在安全关键应用中增强了深度学习模型的可信度，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Knowing the uncertainty associated with the output of a deep neural network
is of paramount importance in making trustworthy decisions, particularly in
high-stakes fields like medical diagnosis and autonomous systems. Monte Carlo
Dropout (MCD) is a widely used method for uncertainty quantification, as it can
be easily integrated into various deep architectures. However, conventional MCD
often struggles with providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. To
address this, we introduce innovative frameworks that enhances MCD by
integrating different search solutions namely Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO),
Bayesian Optimization (BO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as well as an
uncertainty-aware loss function, thereby improving the reliability of
uncertainty quantification. We conduct comprehensive experiments using
different backbones, namely DenseNet121, ResNet50, and VGG16, on various
datasets, including Cats vs. Dogs, Myocarditis, Wisconsin, and a synthetic
dataset (Circles). Our proposed algorithm outperforms the MCD baseline by 2-3%
on average in terms of both conventional accuracy and uncertainty accuracy
while achieving significantly better calibration. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to enhance the trustworthiness of deep learning
models in safety-critical applications.

Result: 实验显示性能平均提升41.7%，推理成本降低70.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在推理准确性和计算效率上均取得显著改进。

Abstract: Multimodal pathological image understanding has garnered widespread interest
due to its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and enable personalized
treatment through integrated visual and textual data. However, existing methods
exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, which hamper their ability to handle
complex diagnostic scenarios. Additionally, the enormous size of pathological
images leads to severe computational burdens, further restricting their
practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
bilateral reinforcement learning framework comprising two synergistic branches.
One reinforcement branch enhances the reasoning capability by enabling the
model to learn task-specific decision processes, i.e., pathology rationales,
directly from labels without explicit reasoning supervision. While the other
branch dynamically allocates a tailored number of tokens to different images
based on both their visual content and task context, thereby optimizing
computational efficiency. We apply our method to various pathological tasks
such as visual question answering, cancer subtyping, and lesion detection.
Extensive experiments show an average +41.7 absolute performance improvement
with 70.3% lower inference costs over the base models, achieving both reasoning
accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HAMF通过联合学习场景理解和运动预测，显著提升了运动预测的准确性和多样性。

Abstract: Motion forecasting represents a critical challenge in autonomous driving
systems, requiring accurate prediction of surrounding agents' future
trajectories. While existing approaches predict future motion states with the
extracted scene context feature from historical agent trajectories and road
layouts, they suffer from the information degradation during the scene feature
encoding. To address the limitation, we propose HAMF, a novel motion
forecasting framework that learns future motion representations with the scene
context encoding jointly, to coherently combine the scene understanding and
future motion state prediction. We first embed the observed agent states and
map information into 1D token sequences, together with the target multi-modal
future motion features as a set of learnable tokens. Then we design a unified
Attention-based encoder, which synergistically combines self-attention and
cross-attention mechanisms to model the scene context information and aggregate
future motion features jointly. Complementing the encoder, we implement the
Mamba module in the decoding stage to further preserve the consistency and
correlations among the learned future motion representations, to generate the
accurate and diverse final trajectories. Extensive experiments on Argoverse 2
benchmark demonstrate that our hybrid Attention-Mamba model achieves
state-of-the-art motion forecasting performance with the simple and lightweight
architecture.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity underwater scenes remains a challenging task due
to light absorption, scattering, and limited visibility inherent in aquatic
environments. This paper presents an enhanced Gaussian Splatting-based
framework that improves both the visual quality and geometric accuracy of deep
underwater rendering. We propose decoupled learning for RGB channels, guided by
the physics of underwater attenuation, to enable more accurate colour
restoration. To address sparse-view limitations and improve view consistency,
we introduce a frame interpolation strategy with a novel adaptive weighting
scheme. Additionally, we introduce a new loss function aimed at reducing noise
while preserving edges, which is essential for deep-sea content. We also
release a newly collected dataset, Submerged3D, captured specifically in
deep-sea environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework

Abstract: The intrication of brain signals drives research that leverages multimodal AI
to align brain modalities with visual and textual data for explainable
descriptions. However, most existing studies are limited to coarse
interpretations, lacking essential details on object descriptions, locations,
attributes, and their relationships. This leads to imprecise and ambiguous
reconstructions when using such cues for visual decoding. To address this, we
analyze different choices of vision feature spaces from pre-trained visual
components within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and introduce a
zero-shot multimodal brain decoding method that interacts with these models to
decode across multiple levels of granularities. % To assess a model's ability
to decode fine details from brain signals, we propose the Multi-Granularity
Brain Detail Understanding Benchmark (MG-BrainDub). This benchmark includes two
key tasks: detailed descriptions and salient question-answering, with metrics
highlighting key visual elements like objects, attributes, and relationships.
Our approach enhances neural decoding precision and supports more accurate

Abstract: Acquiring detailed 3D scenes typically demands costly equipment, multi-view
data, or labor-intensive modeling. Therefore, a lightweight alternative,
generating complex 3D scenes from a single top-down image, plays an essential
role in real-world applications. While recent 3D generative models have
achieved remarkable results at the object level, their extension to full-scene
generation often leads to inconsistent geometry, layout hallucinations, and
low-quality meshes. In this work, we introduce 3DTown, a training-free
framework designed to synthesize realistic and coherent 3D scenes from a single
top-down view. Our method is grounded in two principles: region-based
generation to improve image-to-3D alignment and resolution, and spatial-aware
3D inpainting to ensure global scene coherence and high-quality geometry
generation. Specifically, we decompose the input image into overlapping regions
and generate each using a pretrained 3D object generator, followed by a masked
rectified flow inpainting process that fills in missing geometry while
maintaining structural continuity. This modular design allows us to overcome
resolution bottlenecks and preserve spatial structure without requiring 3D
supervision or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across diverse scenes show
that 3DTown outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including Trellis,
Hunyuan3D-2, and TripoSG, in terms of geometry quality, spatial coherence, and
texture fidelity. Our results demonstrate that high-quality 3D town generation
is achievable from a single image using a principled, training-free approach.

Conclusion: IA-T2I框架通过参考图像有效解决了文本提示知识不确定的问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models achieve promising results, but
they fail on the scenarios where the knowledge implied in the text prompt is
uncertain. For example, a T2I model released in February would struggle to
generate a suitable poster for a movie premiering in April, because the
character designs and styles are uncertain to the model. To solve this problem,
we propose an Internet-Augmented text-to-image generation (IA-T2I) framework to
compel T2I models clear about such uncertain knowledge by providing them with
reference images. Specifically, an active retrieval module is designed to
determine whether a reference image is needed based on the given text prompt; a
hierarchical image selection module is introduced to find the most suitable
image returned by an image search engine to enhance the T2I model; a
self-reflection mechanism is presented to continuously evaluate and refine the
generated image to ensure faithful alignment with the text prompt. To evaluate
the proposed framework's performance, we collect a dataset named Img-Ref-T2I,
where text prompts include three types of uncertain knowledge: (1) known but
rare. (2) unknown. (3) ambiguous. Moreover, we carefully craft a complex prompt
to guide GPT-4o in making preference evaluation, which has been shown to have
an evaluation accuracy similar to that of human preference evaluation.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
outperforming GPT-4o by about 30% in human evaluation.

TLDR: VARD提出了一种基于价值函数的强化学习方法，用于优化预训练扩散模型，解决了现有方法在稳定性和非可微奖励上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法在微调预训练扩散模型时存在稳定性差、效率低且不支持非可微奖励的问题，需要密集且可微的监督信号。

Method: VARD通过学习预测奖励期望的价值函数，并结合KL正则化，为生成过程提供密集监督，同时保持与预训练模型的接近性。

Result: 实验表明，VARD能更好地指导生成轨迹，提高训练效率，并扩展了强化学习在复杂非可微奖励优化中的应用。

Conclusion: VARD为扩散模型的强化学习微调提供了一种稳定高效的方法，适用于复杂非可微奖励场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools across various
domains, yet tailoring pre-trained models to exhibit specific desirable
properties remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising solution,current methods struggle to simultaneously achieve stable,
efficient fine-tuning and support non-differentiable rewards. Furthermore,
their reliance on sparse rewards provides inadequate supervision during
intermediate steps, often resulting in suboptimal generation quality. To
address these limitations, dense and differentiable signals are required
throughout the diffusion process. Hence, we propose VAlue-based Reinforced
Diffusion (VARD): a novel approach that first learns a value function
predicting expection of rewards from intermediate states, and subsequently uses
this value function with KL regularization to provide dense supervision
throughout the generation process. Our method maintains proximity to the
pretrained model while enabling effective and stable training via
backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach facilitates
better trajectory guidance, improves training efficiency and extends the
applicability of RL to diffusion models optimized for complex,
non-differentiable reward functions.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成数字人类视频时存在质量差、一致性低和身份保留不足的问题，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 引入了一种称为ISA的交叉注意力机制，结合扩散变换器（DiT）和定制的视频变分自编码器，在大规模视频数据上训练模型。

Result: 模型在4D人类视频合成中达到了最先进的性能，表现出卓越的运动一致性和身份保留能力，同时支持对相机和身体姿势的精确控制。

Conclusion: ISA机制为数字人类视频生成提供了一种高效且可控的新方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Generating photorealistic videos of digital humans in a controllable manner
is crucial for a plethora of applications. Existing approaches either build on
methods that employ template-based 3D representations or emerging video
generation models but suffer from poor quality or limited consistency and
identity preservation when generating individual or multiple digital humans. In
this paper, we introduce a new interspatial attention (ISA) mechanism as a
scalable building block for modern diffusion transformer (DiT)--based video
generation models. ISA is a new type of cross attention that uses relative
positional encodings tailored for the generation of human videos. Leveraging a
custom-developed video variation autoencoder, we train a latent ISA-based
diffusion model on a large corpus of video data. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance for 4D human video synthesis, demonstrating
remarkable motion consistency and identity preservation while providing precise
control of the camera and body poses. Our code and model are publicly released

Conclusion: STAR-R1为MLLMs和推理模型的研究提供了重要启示，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they lag significantly behind humans in
spatial reasoning. We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual
Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object
transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in
cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from
inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm
with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1
rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive
inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive
evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios.
Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its
unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work
provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning
models. The codes, model weights, and data will be publicly available at

Motivation: 旨在解决多模态任务中预训练与后训练之间的差距，提供统一的扩散架构以实现跨模态的无缝集成和高效处理。

Conclusion: MMaDA为多模态任务提供了统一的框架，未来研究可在此基础上进一步探索。

Abstract: We introduce MMaDA, a novel class of multimodal diffusion foundation models
designed to achieve superior performance across diverse domains such as textual
reasoning, multimodal understanding, and text-to-image generation. The approach
is distinguished by three key innovations: (i) MMaDA adopts a unified diffusion
architecture with a shared probabilistic formulation and a modality-agnostic
design, eliminating the need for modality-specific components. This
architecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data
types. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning
strategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities. By aligning
reasoning processes between textual and visual domains, this strategy
facilitates cold-start training for the final reinforcement learning (RL)
stage, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex tasks from the
outset. (iii) We propose UniGRPO, a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm
specifically tailored for diffusion foundation models. Utilizing diversified
reward modeling, UniGRPO unifies post-training across both reasoning and
generation tasks, ensuring consistent performance improvements. Experimental
results demonstrate that MMaDA-8B exhibits strong generalization capabilities
as a unified multimodal foundation model. It surpasses powerful models like
LLaMA-3-7B and Qwen2-7B in textual reasoning, outperforms Show-o and SEED-X in
multimodal understanding, and excels over SDXL and Janus in text-to-image
generation. These achievements highlight MMaDA's effectiveness in bridging the
gap between pretraining and post-training within unified diffusion
architectures, providing a comprehensive framework for future research and
development. We open-source our code and trained models at:

Motivation: 解决基于示例的图像着色中语义匹配不准确的问题，利用预训练扩散模型的强大注意力能力。

Method: 采用预训练扩散模型的自注意力模块计算输入与参考图像的注意力图，实现双注意力引导的颜色转移和分类器自由指导。

Conclusion: 该方法无需微调，通过双注意力机制和分类器自由指导显著提升了图像着色质量和语义匹配精度。

Abstract: Exemplar-based image colorization aims to colorize a grayscale image using a
reference color image, ensuring that reference colors are applied to
corresponding input regions based on their semantic similarity. To achieve
accurate semantic matching between regions, we leverage the self-attention
module of a pre-trained diffusion model, which is trained on a large dataset
and exhibits powerful attention capabilities. To harness this power, we propose
a novel, fine-tuning-free approach based on a pre-trained diffusion model,
making two key contributions. First, we introduce dual attention-guided color
transfer. We utilize the self-attention module to compute an attention map
between the input and reference images, effectively capturing semantic
correspondences. The color features from the reference image is then
transferred to the semantically matching regions of the input image, guided by
this attention map, and finally, the grayscale features are replaced with the
corresponding color features. Notably, we utilize dual attention to calculate
attention maps separately for the grayscale and color images, achieving more
precise semantic alignment. Second, we propose classifier-free colorization
guidance, which enhances the transferred colors by combining color-transferred
and non-color-transferred outputs. This process improves the quality of
colorization. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing techniques in terms of image quality and fidelity to the reference.
Specifically, we use 335 input-reference pairs from previous research,
achieving an FID of 95.27 (image quality) and an SI-FID of 5.51 (fidelity to
the reference). Our source code is available at

Motivation: SfM问题在理论和实践中都备受关注，但缺乏系统分类。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将SfM方法分为三类，根据其关注点（运动或结构）进行分类，并分析理论条件。

Result: 提出了新的分类视角，为现有方法提供了新见解，并指出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文的分类框架为SfM研究提供了新视角，并强调了理论条件的重要性。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) refers to the problem of recovering both
structure (i.e., 3D coordinates of points in the scene) and motion (i.e.,
camera matrices) starting from point correspondences in multiple images. It has
attracted significant attention over the years, counting practical
reconstruction pipelines as well as theoretical results. This paper is
conceived as a conceptual review of SfM methods, which are grouped into three
main categories, according to which part of the problem - between motion and
structure - they focus on. The proposed taxonomy brings a new perspective on
existing SfM approaches as well as insights into open problems and possible
future research directions. Particular emphasis is given on identifying the
theoretical conditions that make SfM well posed, which depend on the problem
formulation that is being considered.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型在视觉令牌上存在计算冗余，现有方法仅关注令牌级冗余，而忽略了计算级冗余。

Method: 设计实验发现视觉令牌的计算冗余，提出ProxyV方法，用代理视觉令牌减轻计算负担。

Result: ProxyV在提升效率的同时保持性能，甚至在某些情况下带来性能提升，并能与令牌缩减方法结合。

Conclusion: ProxyV是一种灵活高效的方法，可显著减少计算冗余，适用于多模态任务。

Abstract: Large multimodal models excel in multimodal tasks but face significant
computational challenges due to excessive computation on visual tokens. Unlike
token reduction methods that focus on token-level redundancy, we identify and
study the computation-level redundancy on vision tokens to ensure no
information loss. Our key insight is that vision tokens from the pretrained
vision encoder do not necessarily require all the heavy operations (e.g.,
self-attention, FFNs) in decoder-only LMMs and could be processed more lightly
with proper designs. We designed a series of experiments to discover and
progressively squeeze out the vision-related computation redundancy. Based on
our findings, we propose ProxyV, a novel approach that utilizes proxy vision
tokens to alleviate the computational burden on original vision tokens. ProxyV
enhances efficiency without compromising performance and can even yield notable
performance gains in scenarios with more moderate efficiency improvements.
Furthermore, the flexibility of ProxyV is demonstrated through its combination
with token reduction methods to boost efficiency further. The code will be made
public at this https://github.com/penghao-wu/ProxyV URL.

Result: InstructSAM在多项任务中表现优于基线，推理时间稳定，输出标记减少89%，运行时间降低32%。

Conclusion: 论文的任务、基准和框架为开发多功能对象识别系统提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Language-Guided object recognition in remote sensing imagery is crucial for
large-scale mapping and automated data annotation. However, existing
open-vocabulary and visual grounding methods rely on explicit category cues,
limiting their ability to handle complex or implicit queries that require
advanced reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce a new suite of tasks,
including Instruction-Oriented Object Counting, Detection, and Segmentation
(InstructCDS), covering open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass
scenarios. We further present EarthInstruct, the first InstructCDS benchmark
for earth observation. It is constructed from two diverse remote sensing
datasets with varying spatial resolutions and annotation rules across 20
categories, necessitating models to interpret dataset-specific instructions.
Given the scarcity of semantically rich labeled data in remote sensing, we
propose InstructSAM, a training-free framework for instruction-driven object
recognition. InstructSAM leverages large vision-language models to interpret
user instructions and estimate object counts, employs SAM2 for mask proposal,
and formulates mask-label assignment as a binary integer programming problem.
By integrating semantic similarity with counting constraints, InstructSAM
efficiently assigns categories to predicted masks without relying on confidence
thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that InstructSAM matches or surpasses
specialized baselines across multiple tasks while maintaining near-constant
inference time regardless of object count, reducing output tokens by 89% and
overall runtime by over 32% compared to direct generation approaches. We
believe the contributions of the proposed tasks, benchmark, and effective
approach will advance future research in developing versatile object
recognition systems.

Abstract: The automatic analysis of document layouts in digital-born PDF documents
remains a challenging problem due to the heterogeneous arrangement of textual
and nontextual elements and the imprecision of the textual metadata in the
Portable Document Format. In this work, we benchmark Graph Neural Network (GNN)
architectures for the task of fine-grained layout classification of text blocks
from digital native documents. We introduce two graph construction structures:
a k-closest-neighbor graph and a fully connected graph, and generate node
features via pre-trained text and vision models, thus avoiding manual feature
engineering. Three experimental frameworks are evaluated: single-modality (text
or visual), concatenated multimodal, and dual-branch multimodal. We evaluated
four foundational GNN models and compared them with the baseline. Our
experiments are specifically conducted on a rich dataset of public affairs
documents that includes more than 20 sources (e.g., regional and national-level
official gazettes), 37K PDF documents, with 441K pages in total. Our results
demonstrate that GraphSAGE operating on the k-closest-neighbor graph in a
dual-branch configuration achieves the highest per-class and overall accuracy,
outperforming the baseline in some sources. These findings confirm the
importance of local layout relationships and multimodal fusion exploited
through GNNs for the analysis of native digital document layouts.

Motivation: 传统软件工程情感分析工具难以处理领域特有的复杂语言，因此需要评估现代Transformer模型的表现。

Method: 使用GitHub、Stack Overflow和Jira数据集，对BERT和GPT-4o-mini进行微调和默认配置的基准测试。

Result: GPT-4o-mini在复杂数据集（如Stack Overflow）上表现更优（准确率85.3%），而BERT在结构化数据集（如GitHub和Jira）上表现更好（F1分数0.93和0.98）。

Conclusion: 模型选择需与数据集特性匹配，未来研究应优化针对软件工程领域的情感分析工具。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding developer
interactions, issue resolutions, and project dynamics within software
engineering (SE). While traditional SE-specific sentiment analysis tools have
made significant strides, they often fail to account for the nuanced and
context-dependent language inherent to the domain. This study systematically
evaluates the performance of bidirectional transformers, such as BERT, against
generative pre-trained transformers, specifically GPT-4o-mini, in SE sentiment
analysis. Using datasets from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Jira, we benchmark
the models' capabilities with fine-tuned and default configurations. The
results reveal that fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini performs comparable to BERT and
other bidirectional models on structured and balanced datasets like GitHub and
Jira, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.93 and 0.98, respectively.
However, on linguistically complex datasets with imbalanced sentiment
distributions, such as Stack Overflow, the default GPT-4o-mini model exhibits
superior generalization, achieving an accuracy of 85.3\% compared to the
fine-tuned model's 13.1\%. These findings highlight the trade-offs between
fine-tuning and leveraging pre-trained models for SE tasks. The study
underscores the importance of aligning model architectures with dataset
characteristics to optimize performance and proposes directions for future
research in refining sentiment analysis tools tailored to the SE domain.

Abstract: Frequently, multiple entities (methods, algorithms, procedures, solutions,

that differ in the distribution of scenarios encountered. For example, in
computer vision, the input data provided to image analysis methods depend on
the type of sensor used, its location, and the scene content. However, a
crucial difficulty remains: can we predict which entities will perform best in
a new domain based on assessments on known domains, without having to carry out
new and costly evaluations? This paper presents an original methodology to
address this question, in a leave-one-domain-out fashion, for various
application-specific preferences. We illustrate its use with 30 strategies to
predict the rankings of 40 entities (unsupervised background subtraction
methods) on 53 domains (videos).

Abstract: Whole-body audio-driven avatar pose and expression generation is a critical
task for creating lifelike digital humans and enhancing the capabilities of
interactive virtual agents, with wide-ranging applications in virtual reality,
digital entertainment, and remote communication. Existing approaches often
generate audio-driven facial expressions and gestures independently, which
introduces a significant limitation: the lack of seamless coordination between
facial and gestural elements, resulting in less natural and cohesive
animations. To address this limitation, we propose AsynFusion, a novel
framework that leverages diffusion transformers to achieve harmonious
expression and gesture synthesis. The proposed method is built upon a
dual-branch DiT architecture, which enables the parallel generation of facial
expressions and gestures. Within the model, we introduce a Cooperative
Synchronization Module to facilitate bidirectional feature interaction between
the two modalities, and an Asynchronous LCM Sampling strategy to reduce
computational overhead while maintaining high-quality outputs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AsynFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance
in generating real-time, synchronized whole-body animations, consistently
outperforming existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled substantial
advances in solving mathematical problems. However, existing benchmarks often
fail to reflect the complexity of real-world problems, which demand open-ended,
interdisciplinary reasoning and integration of computational tools. To address
this gap, we introduce ModelingBench, a novel benchmark featuring
real-world-inspired, open-ended problems from math modeling competitions across
diverse domains, ranging from urban traffic optimization to ecosystem resource
planning. These tasks require translating natural language into formal
mathematical formulations, applying appropriate tools, and producing
structured, defensible reports. ModelingBench also supports multiple valid
solutions, capturing the ambiguity and creativity of practical modeling. We
also present ModelingAgent, a multi-agent framework that coordinates tool use,
supports structured workflows, and enables iterative self-refinement to
generate well-grounded, creative solutions. To evaluate outputs, we further
propose ModelingJudge, an expert-in-the-loop system leveraging LLMs as
domain-specialized judges assessing solutions from multiple expert
perspectives. Empirical results show that ModelingAgent substantially
outperforms strong baselines and often produces solutions indistinguishable
from those of human experts. Together, our work provides a comprehensive
framework for evaluating and advancing real-world problem-solving in
open-ended, interdisciplinary modeling challenges.

TLDR: 研究发现大型推理模型（LRMs）在强化学习训练下存在三种思考模式（NT、ET、IT），揭示了影响推理行为的关键因素，并指出NT模式牺牲准确性换取输出长度减少，而ET和IT模式在保持准确性的同时减少响应长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂任务中表现优异，但其过度思考倾向导致效率低下，研究旨在揭示其内部机制以优化效率。

Method: 通过分析强化学习训练的LRMs在节省思考时的内部机制，研究其思考终止信心、注意力转移及输入部分关注度。

Result: 发现NT模式减少输出长度但降低准确性，ET和IT模式在保持准确性的同时减少响应长度，揭示了RL优化的LRMs存在不一致性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RL优化的LRMs在效率与准确性之间的权衡，需进一步改进以实现可靠的高效推理。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly advanced performance on
complex tasks, yet their tendency to overthink introduces inefficiencies. This
study investigates the internal mechanisms of reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained LRMs when prompted to save thinking, revealing three distinct
thinking modes: no thinking (NT), explicit thinking (ET), and implicit thinking
(IT). Through comprehensive analysis of confidence in thinking termination,
attention from thinking to generation, and attentional focus on input sections,
we uncover key factors influencing the reasoning behaviors. We further find
that NT reduces output length at the cost of accuracy, while ET and IT maintain
accuracy with reduced response length. Our findings expose fundamental
inconsistencies in RL-optimized LRMs, necessitating adaptive improvements for
reliable efficiency.

TLDR: 论文提出自适应自恢复推理（ASRR）框架，通过抑制冗余推理和隐式恢复机制，显著提升大型推理模型（LRMs）的效率，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务中表现优异，但在简单任务中存在冗余推理问题，导致计算开销过大。

Method: 提出ASRR框架，结合准确性感知的长度奖励调节，根据问题难度自适应分配推理资源。

Result: 实验显示，ASRR在多个基准测试中显著减少推理预算（最高32.5%），性能损失极小（1.2% pass@1），并提升安全性（+21.7%）。

Conclusion: ASRR为大型推理模型提供了一种高效、自适应且安全的推理方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance via long
reasoning chains, but often incur excessive computational overhead due to
redundant reasoning, especially on simple tasks. In this work, we
systematically quantify the upper bounds of LRMs under both Long-Thinking and
No-Thinking modes, and uncover the phenomenon of "Internal Self-Recovery
Mechanism" where models implicitly supplement reasoning during answer
generation. Building on this insight, we propose Adaptive Self-Recovery
Reasoning (ASRR), a framework that suppresses unnecessary reasoning and enables
implicit recovery. By introducing accuracy-aware length reward regulation, ASRR
adaptively allocates reasoning effort according to problem difficulty,
achieving high efficiency with negligible performance sacrifice. Experiments
across multiple benchmarks and models show that, compared with GRPO, ASRR
reduces reasoning budget by up to 32.5% (1.5B) and 25.7% (7B) with minimal
accuracy loss (1.2% and 0.6% pass@1), and significantly boosts harmless rates
on safety benchmarks (up to +21.7%). Our results highlight the potential of
ASRR for enabling efficient, adaptive, and safer reasoning in LRMs.

TLDR: ClickSight是一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的管道，用于从学生点击流数据中解读学习策略，但提示策略和质量改进有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点击流数据具有高维度和细粒度，传统方法缺乏通用性和可扩展性，因此需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: ClickSight利用LLM生成点击流的文本解释，评估了四种提示策略和自我改进的效果。

Result: LLM能合理解读学习策略，但质量因提示策略而异，自我改进效果有限。

Conclusion: ClickSight展示了LLM在教育数据中生成理论驱动洞察的潜力。

Abstract: Clickstream data from digital learning environments offer valuable insights
into students' learning behaviors, but are challenging to interpret due to
their high dimensionality and granularity. Prior approaches have relied mainly
on handcrafted features, expert labeling, clustering, or supervised models,
therefore often lacking generalizability and scalability. In this work, we
introduce ClickSight, an in-context Large Language Model (LLM)-based pipeline
that interprets student clickstreams to reveal their learning strategies.
ClickSight takes raw clickstreams and a list of learning strategies as input
and generates textual interpretations of students' behaviors during
interaction. We evaluate four different prompting strategies and investigate
the impact of self-refinement on interpretation quality. Our evaluation spans
two open-ended learning environments and uses a rubric-based domain-expert
evaluation. Results show that while LLMs can reasonably interpret learning
strategies from clickstreams, interpretation quality varies by prompting
strategy, and self-refinement offers limited improvement. ClickSight
demonstrates the potential of LLMs to generate theory-driven insights from
educational interaction data.

Abstract: We introduce a unified approach to forecast the dynamics of human keypoints
along with the motion trajectory based on a short sequence of input poses.
While many studies address either full-body pose prediction or motion
trajectory prediction, only a few attempt to merge them. We propose a motion
transformation technique to simultaneously predict full-body pose and
trajectory key-points in a global coordinate frame. We utilize an off-the-shelf
3D human pose estimation module, a graph attention network to encode the
skeleton structure, and a compact, non-autoregressive transformer suitable for
real-time motion prediction for human-robot interaction and human-aware
navigation. We introduce a human navigation dataset ``DARKO'' with specific
focus on navigational activities that are relevant for human-aware mobile robot
navigation. We perform extensive evaluation on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and our
DARKO dataset. In comparison to prior work, we show that our approach is
compact, real-time, and accurate in predicting human navigation motion across
all datasets. Result animations, our dataset, and code will be available at

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中存在幻觉、低效推理和缺乏验证的问题，需改进。

Result: 在DriveLMM-o1基准上，推理分数提升53.91%，答案准确率提高33.54%。

Conclusion: AgentThink为开发可信赖的自动驾驶模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for autonomous driving, yet their
struggle with hallucinations, inefficient reasoning, and limited real-world
validation hinders accurate perception and robust step-by-step reasoning. To
overcome this, we introduce \textbf{AgentThink}, a pioneering unified framework
that, for the first time, integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with
dynamic, agent-style tool invocation for autonomous driving tasks. AgentThink's
core innovations include: \textbf{(i) Structured Data Generation}, by
establishing an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct
structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage
for diverse driving scenarios; \textbf{(ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline},
employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to equip VLMs with the capability for autonomous tool invocation; and
\textbf{(iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation}, introducing a novel
multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool
invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark
demonstrate AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by
\textbf{53.91\%} and enhances answer accuracy by \textbf{33.54\%}, while
markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation
studies and robust zero-shot/few-shot generalization experiments across various
benchmarks underscore its powerful capabilities. These findings highlight a
promising trajectory for developing trustworthy and tool-aware autonomous
driving models.

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作模型在跨任务泛化能力上研究不足，限制了其在开放世界中的通用机器人操作应用。

Method: 提出AGNOSTOS模拟基准和X-ICM方法，利用上下文演示和动态引导样本选择策略提升泛化能力。

Result: X-ICM在AGNOSTOS上显著优于现有模型，提升了跨任务零样本泛化性能。

Conclusion: AGNOSTOS和X-ICM为通用机器人操作研究提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of vision-language-action (VLA) models to
unseen tasks are crucial to achieving general-purpose robotic manipulation in
open-world settings. However, the cross-task generalization capabilities of
existing VLA models remain significantly underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce AGNOSTOS, a novel simulation benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate cross-task zero-shot generalization in manipulation. AGNOSTOS
comprises 23 unseen manipulation tasks for testing, distinct from common
training task distributions, and incorporates two levels of generalization
difficulty to assess robustness. Our systematic evaluation reveals that current
VLA models, despite being trained on diverse datasets, struggle to generalize
effectively to these unseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Cross-Task In-Context Manipulation (X-ICM), a method that conditions large
language models (LLMs) on in-context demonstrations from seen tasks to predict
action sequences for unseen tasks. Additionally, we introduce a dynamics-guided
sample selection strategy that identifies relevant demonstrations by capturing
cross-task dynamics. On AGNOSTOS, X-ICM significantly improves cross-task
zero-shot generalization performance over leading VLAs. We believe AGNOSTOS and
X-ICM will serve as valuable tools for advancing general-purpose robotic
manipulation.

Motivation: 尽管LLM在多领域表现出潜力，但在机器人应用中仍受限于静态、基于提示的行为，难以处理零样本或少样本的复杂任务。

Method: 提出一个集成元认知学习的框架，通过技能分解和自我反思机制，使LLM驱动的机器人能够从先前任务中学习、反思失败并合成新解决方案。

Conclusion: 元认知学习可增强LLM在机器人任务中的创造性和规划能力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential across various
domains, their applications in robotics remain largely limited to static,
prompt-based behaviors and still face challenges in handling complex tasks
under zero-shot or few-shot settings. Inspired by human metacognitive learning
and creative problem-solving, we address this limitation by exploring a
fundamental research question: Can LLMs be empowered with metacognitive
capabilities to reason, reflect, and create, thereby enhancing their ability to
perform robotic tasks with minimal demonstrations? In this paper, we present an
early-stage framework that integrates metacognitive learning into LLM-powered
multi-robot collaboration. The proposed framework equips the LLM-powered
robotic agents with a skill decomposition and self-reflection mechanism that
identifies modular skills from prior tasks, reflects on failures in unseen task
scenarios, and synthesizes effective new solutions. Experimental results show
that our metacognitive-learning-empowered LLM framework significantly
outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, we observe that the framework is
capable of generating solutions that differ from the ground truth yet still
successfully complete the tasks. These exciting findings support our hypothesis
that metacognitive learning can foster creativity in robotic planning.

Conclusion: Robo2VLM为VLM提供了新的评估和增强途径，尤其在机器人任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) acquire real-world knowledge and general
reasoning ability through Internet-scale image-text corpora. They can augment
robotic systems with scene understanding and task planning, and assist
visuomotor policies that are trained on robot trajectory data. We explore the
reverse paradigm - using rich, real, multi-modal robot trajectory data to
enhance and evaluate VLMs. In this paper, we present Robo2VLM, a Visual
Question Answering (VQA) dataset generation framework for VLMs. Given a human
tele-operated robot trajectory, Robo2VLM derives ground-truth from non-visual
and non-descriptive sensory modalities, such as end-effector pose, gripper
aperture, and force sensing. Based on these modalities, it segments the robot
trajectory into a sequence of manipulation phases. At each phase, Robo2VLM uses
scene and interaction understanding to identify 3D properties of the robot,
task goal, and the target object. The properties are used to generate
representative VQA queries - images with textural multiple-choice questions -
based on spatial, goal-conditioned, and interaction reasoning question
templates. We curate Robo2VLM-1, a large-scale in-the-wild dataset with 684,710
questions covering 463 distinct scenes and 3,396 robotic manipulation tasks
from 176k real robot trajectories. Results suggest that Robo2VLM-1 can
benchmark and improve VLM capabilities in spatial and interaction reasoning.

demonstrating how evolutionary methods automate and refine these processes.
Secondly, the survey investigates how LLMs improve EC by automating
metaheuristic design, tuning evolutionary algorithms, and generating adaptive

Conclusion: AI代理在网络安全中展现出潜力，但攻防能力差异显著，需进一步优化。

Abstract: AI agents have the potential to significantly alter the cybersecurity
landscape. To help us understand this change, we introduce the first framework
to capture offensive and defensive cyber-capabilities in evolving real-world
systems. Instantiating this framework with BountyBench, we set up 25 systems
with complex, real-world codebases. To capture the vulnerability lifecycle, we
define three task types: Detect (detecting a new vulnerability), Exploit
(exploiting a specific vulnerability), and Patch (patching a specific
vulnerability). For Detect, we construct a new success indicator, which is
general across vulnerability types and provides localized evaluation. We
manually set up the environment for each system, including installing packages,
setting up server(s), and hydrating database(s). We add 40 bug bounties, which
are vulnerabilities with monetary awards from \$10 to \$30,485, and cover 9 of
the OWASP Top 10 Risks. To modulate task difficulty, we devise a new strategy
based on information to guide detection, interpolating from identifying a zero
day to exploiting a specific vulnerability. We evaluate 5 agents: Claude Code,
OpenAI Codex CLI, and custom agents with GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and
Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking. Given up to three attempts, the top-performing
agents are Claude Code (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,350), Custom Agent with
Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,025; 67.5% on
Exploit), and OpenAI Codex CLI (5% on Detect, mapping to \$2,400; 90% on Patch,
mapping to \$14,422). OpenAI Codex CLI and Claude Code are more capable at
defense, achieving higher Patch scores of 90% and 87.5%, compared to Exploit
scores of 32.5% and 57.5% respectively; in contrast, the custom agents are
relatively balanced between offense and defense, achieving Exploit scores of
40-67.5% and Patch scores of 45-60%.

Result: 该方法在多种防御和模型上表现高效，并发现通用对抗后缀，证明现有防御方法的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 当前对齐防御方法脆弱，需考虑更强的威胁模型以确保LLM安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in real-world applications
ranging from chatbots to agentic systems. Alignment is one of the main
approaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and
jailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even
against Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates
adversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search
space over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding
successful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to
local minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we
assess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed
threat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment
process. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the
intermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting
as a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly
effective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show
our informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show
a gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack
performance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to
successfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective
across diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs,
effective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses,
that these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit
alignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together,
our results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and
the need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs.

Result: 实验表明SCR能有效防御已知和新兴的越狱攻击，显著提升模型安全性。

Conclusion: SCR为LLM安全提供了一种可扩展且鲁棒的防护范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking
attacks, wherein adversaries exploit carefully engineered prompts to induce
harmful or unethical responses. Such threats have raised critical concerns
about the safety and reliability of LLMs in real-world deployment. While
existing defense mechanisms partially mitigate such risks, subsequent
advancements in adversarial techniques have enabled novel jailbreaking methods
to circumvent these protections, exposing the limitations of static defense
frameworks. In this work, we explore defending against evolving jailbreaking
threats through the lens of context retrieval. First, we conduct a preliminary
study demonstrating that even a minimal set of safety-aligned examples against
a particular jailbreak can significantly enhance robustness against this attack
pattern. Building on this insight, we further leverage the retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) techniques and propose Safety Context Retrieval (SCR), a
scalable and robust safeguarding paradigm for LLMs against jailbreaking. Our
comprehensive experiments demonstrate how SCR achieves superior defensive
performance against both established and emerging jailbreaking tactics,
contributing a new paradigm to LLM safety. Our code will be available upon
publication.

TLDR: 该研究开发了一种深度学习模型，利用治疗前的H&E染色活检图像预测TNBC患者对新辅助化疗（NACT）的反应，模型表现优异，并揭示了与免疫生物标志物相关的预测区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TNBC缺乏靶向治疗选择，且仅40-50%患者对新辅助化疗达到完全缓解，因此准确预测NACT反应对优化治疗至关重要。

Method: 使用深度学习模型分析H&E染色活检图像，结合五折交叉验证评估性能，并通过mIHC数据验证模型关注区域。

Result: 模型在五折交叉验证中表现优异（准确率82%，AUC 0.86），预测区域与PD-L1表达、CD8+ T细胞浸润等免疫标志物相关。

Conclusion: 结合免疫组化数据可提升模型解释性和预测性能，并可能加速发现新的组织病理学生物标志物，推动TNBC个性化治疗。

Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype defined by the
lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, resulting in limited targeted
treatment options. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is the standard treatment
for early-stage TNBC, with pathologic complete response (pCR) serving as a key
prognostic marker; however, only 40-50% of patients with TNBC achieve pCR.
Accurate prediction of NACT response is crucial to optimize therapy, avoid
ineffective treatments, and improve patient outcomes. In this study, we
developed a deep learning model to predict NACT response using pre-treatment
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained biopsy images. Our model achieved promising
results in five-fold cross-validation (accuracy: 82%, AUC: 0.86, F1-score:
0.84, sensitivity: 0.85, specificity: 0.81, precision: 0.80). Analysis of model
attention maps in conjunction with multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) data
revealed that regions of high predictive importance consistently colocalized
with tumor areas showing elevated PD-L1 expression, CD8+ T-cell infiltration,
and CD163+ macrophage density - all established biomarkers of treatment
response. Our findings indicate that incorporating IHC-derived immune profiling
data could substantially improve model interpretability and predictive
performance. Furthermore, this approach may accelerate the discovery of novel
histopathological biomarkers for NACT and advance the development of
personalized treatment strategies for TNBC patients.

TLDR: 论文探讨了如何将Maximal Update Parametrization（μP）方法扩展到扩散Transformer中，以降低超参数调优成本并提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer在视觉生成模型中表现优异，但大规模超参数调优成本高昂。μP方法在普通Transformer中已证明有效，但尚未在扩散Transformer中验证。

Method: 将标准μP方法推广到扩散Transformer（如DiT、U-ViT等），并通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，μP方法在扩散Transformer中同样有效，显著提升了收敛速度和模型性能，同时大幅降低调优成本。

Conclusion: μP是一种高效且可靠的框架，适用于扩散Transformer的扩展和优化。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative
models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter
(HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P)
was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from
small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However,
it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion
Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we
generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its
effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that
$\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT,
PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer,
enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging
this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP
transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate
achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling
PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases,
models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small
tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of
consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a
principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.

Motivation: OoD检测对深度神经网络的可靠性至关重要，但现有方法在捕捉InD与OoD数据差异方面存在不足。本文从非线性特征子空间的新视角出发，旨在更有效地表征这种差异。

Method: 利用KPCA框架学习判别性非线性子空间，设计Cosine-Gaussian核函数捕捉关键非线性模式，并引入高效计算技术解决大规模数据下的核矩阵计算问题。

Conclusion: 本文为OoD检测提供了新的非线性特征子空间视角，并通过核函数设计和计算优化，实现了高效且有效的检测方法。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection is vital for the reliability of deep
neural networks, the key of which lies in effectively characterizing the
disparities between OoD and In-Distribution (InD) data. In this work, such
disparities are exploited through a fresh perspective of non-linear feature
subspace. That is, a discriminative non-linear subspace is learned from InD
features to capture representative patterns of InD, while informative patterns
of OoD features cannot be well captured in such a subspace due to their
different distribution. Grounded on this perspective, we exploit the deviations
of InD and OoD features in such a non-linear subspace for effective OoD
detection. To be specific, we leverage the framework of Kernel Principal
Component Analysis (KPCA) to attain the discriminative non-linear subspace and
deploy the reconstruction error on such subspace to distinguish InD and OoD
data. Two challenges emerge: (i) the learning of an effective non-linear
subspace, i.e., the selection of kernel function in KPCA, and (ii) the
computation of the kernel matrix with large-scale InD data. For the former, we
reveal two vital non-linear patterns that closely relate to the InD-OoD
disparity, leading to the establishment of a Cosine-Gaussian kernel for
constructing the subspace. For the latter, we introduce two techniques to
approximate the Cosine-Gaussian kernel with significantly cheap computations.
In particular, our approximation is further tailored by incorporating the InD
data confidence, which is demonstrated to promote the learning of
discriminative subspaces for OoD data. Our study presents new insights into the
non-linear feature subspace for OoD detection and contributes practical
explorations on the associated kernel design and efficient computations,
yielding a KPCA detection method with distinctively improved efficacy and
efficiency.

TLDR: 提出了一种新的多维组合嵌入代数结构，基于方向性非交换幺半群算子，具有理论优势且兼容现代机器学习架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为多维组合嵌入提供统一的代数框架，同时兼容经典序列建模范式。

Method: 定义每个轴的组合算子circ_i，确保沿轴结合性且全局非交换，同时满足全局交换律以实现跨轴一致性。

Result: 框架能泛化经典序列建模方法（如SSMs和自注意力），并支持多维递归和结构化操作。

Conclusion: 该结构为未来深度学习模型设计提供了理论基础，潜在应用包括结构化位置编码和方向性图像嵌入。

Abstract: We introduce a new algebraic structure for multi-dimensional compositional
embeddings, built on directional non-commutative monoidal operators. The core
contribution of this work is this novel framework, which exhibits appealing
theoretical properties (associativity along each dimension and an interchange
law ensuring global consistency) while remaining compatible with modern machine
learning architectures. Our construction defines a distinct composition
operator circ_i for each axis i, ensuring associative combination along each
axis without imposing global commutativity. Importantly, all axis-specific
operators commute with one another, enforcing a global interchange law that
enables consistent crossaxis compositions. This is, to our knowledge, the first
approach that provides a common foundation that generalizes classical
sequence-modeling paradigms (e.g., structured state-space models (SSMs) and
transformer self-attention) to a unified multi-dimensional framework. For
example, specific one-dimensional instances of our framework can recover the
familiar affine transformation algebra, vanilla self-attention, and the
SSM-style recurrence. The higher-dimensional generalizations naturally support
recursive, structure-aware operations in embedding spaces. We outline several
potential applications unlocked by this structure-including structured
positional encodings in Transformers, directional image embeddings, and
symbolic modeling of sequences or grids-indicating that it could inform future
deep learning model designs. We formally establish the algebraic properties of
our framework and discuss efficient implementations. Finally, as our focus is
theoretical, we include no experiments here and defer empirical validation to
future work, which we plan to undertake.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XAI方法很少关注嵌入空间的解释性，而嵌入空间中的维度通常代表复杂抽象概念，因此需要一种新方法来增强其透明度和可信度。

Method: Distance Explainer基于RISE的显著性技术，通过选择性掩码和距离排序掩码过滤为嵌入空间中的距离关系生成解释。

Result: 在ImageNet和CLIP模型上的实验表明，该方法能有效识别相似性或差异性的特征，同时保持高鲁棒性和一致性。

Conclusion: Distance Explainer填补了XAI研究的空白，提升了嵌入空间在深度学习应用中的透明度和可信度。

Abstract: While eXplainable AI (XAI) has advanced significantly, few methods address
interpretability in embedded vector spaces where dimensions represent complex
abstractions. We introduce Distance Explainer, a novel method for generating
local, post-hoc explanations of embedded spaces in machine learning models. Our
approach adapts saliency-based techniques from RISE to explain the distance
between two embedded data points by assigning attribution values through
selective masking and distance-ranked mask filtering. We evaluate Distance
Explainer on cross-modal embeddings (image-image and image-caption pairs) using
established XAI metrics including Faithfulness, Sensitivity/Robustness, and
Randomization. Experiments with ImageNet and CLIP models demonstrate that our
method effectively identifies features contributing to similarity or
dissimilarity between embedded data points while maintaining high robustness
and consistency. We also explore how parameter tuning, particularly mask
quantity and selection strategy, affects explanation quality. This work
addresses a critical gap in XAI research and enhances transparency and
trustworthiness in deep learning applications utilizing embedded spaces.

Motivation: 尽管基础模型在多种任务中表现优异，但其对对抗输入的脆弱性仍未解决。扩散去噪平滑技术被认为是一种有前景的方法，但其有效性在多任务和攻击类型下的表现尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过分析三个数据集、四种下游任务和三种对抗攻击算法，评估扩散去噪平滑技术的效果。

Result: 高噪声扩散去噪会显著降低性能（高达57%），而低噪声设置虽能保持性能，但无法提供全面保护。此外，提出了一种针对扩散过程的新型攻击策略。

Conclusion: 对抗鲁棒性与性能之间的权衡仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: While foundation models demonstrate impressive performance across various
tasks, they remain vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Current research explores
various approaches to enhance model robustness, with Diffusion Denoised
Smoothing emerging as a particularly promising technique. This method employs a
pretrained diffusion model to preprocess inputs before model inference. Yet,
its effectiveness remains largely unexplored beyond classification. We aim to
address this gap by analyzing three datasets with four distinct downstream
tasks under three different adversarial attack algorithms. Our findings reveal
that while foundation models maintain resilience against conventional
transformations, applying high-noise diffusion denoising to clean images
without any distortions significantly degrades performance by as high as 57%.
Low-noise diffusion settings preserve performance but fail to provide adequate
protection across all attack types. Moreover, we introduce a novel attack
strategy specifically targeting the diffusion process itself, capable of
circumventing defenses in the low-noise regime. Our results suggest that the
trade-off between adversarial robustness and performance remains a challenge to
be addressed.

Result: 该方法计算高效且可分析，在多个问题上表现良好，并通过定量结果和LLM评估验证。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提高了SFT的统计效率，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach to adapting large
language models (LLMs) to new domains. In this work, we improve the statistical
efficiency of SFT by selecting an informative subset of training examples.
Specifically, for a fixed budget of training examples, which determines the
computational cost of fine-tuning, we determine the most informative ones. The
key idea in our method is to select examples that maximize information gain,
measured by the Hessian of the log-likelihood of the LLM. We approximate it
efficiently by linearizing the LLM at the last layer using multinomial logistic
regression models. Our approach is computationally efficient, analyzable, and
performs well empirically. We demonstrate this on several problems, and back
our claims with both quantitative results and an LLM evaluation.

Conclusion: EORM通过轻量级后验验证有效提升LLM推理可靠性，性能媲美暴力采样。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language
Models (LLMs), often requiring robust multi step logical consistency. While
Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting elicits reasoning steps, it doesn't guarantee
correctness, and improving reliability via extensive sampling is
computationally costly. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model
(EORM), an effective, lightweight, post hoc verifier. EORM leverages Energy
Based Models (EBMs) to simplify the training of reward models by learning to
assign a scalar energy score to CoT solutions using only outcome labels,
thereby avoiding detailed annotations. It achieves this by interpreting
discriminator output logits as negative energies, effectively ranking
candidates where lower energy is assigned to solutions leading to correct final
outcomes implicitly favoring coherent reasoning. On mathematical benchmarks
(GSM8k, MATH), EORM significantly improves final answer accuracy (e.g., with
Llama 3 8B, achieving 90.7% on GSM8k and 63.7% on MATH). EORM effectively
leverages a given pool of candidate solutions to match or exceed the
performance of brute force sampling, thereby enhancing LLM reasoning outcome
reliability through its streamlined post hoc verification process.

Result: 生成器和验证器在多个数学推理任务中表现最佳，验证器在ProcessBench数据集上领先。

Conclusion: Tango框架通过生成式RL验证器和生成器的协同进化，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a compelling approach for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), where an
LLM generator serves as a policy guided by a verifier (reward model). However,
current RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are
fixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking
and generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently
train both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central
innovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is
trained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is
trained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without
requiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained
verifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to
deterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual
reinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both
components of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models:
the generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level
math benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the
verifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset. Remarkably, both components exhibit
particularly substantial improvements on the most difficult mathematical
reasoning problems. Code is at: https://github.com/kaiwenzha/rl-tango.

Conclusion: MoTime为未来多模态时间序列预测研究提供了更全面和现实的基准。

Abstract: While multimodal data sources are increasingly available from real-world
forecasting, most existing research remains on unimodal time series. In this
work, we present MoTime, a suite of multimodal time series forecasting datasets
that pair temporal signals with external modalities such as text, metadata, and
images. Covering diverse domains, MoTime supports structured evaluation of
modality utility under two scenarios: 1) the common forecasting task, where
varying-length history is available, and 2) cold-start forecasting, where no
historical data is available. Experiments show that external modalities can
improve forecasting performance in both scenarios, with particularly strong
benefits for short series in some datasets, though the impact varies depending
on data characteristics. By making datasets and findings publicly available, we
aim to support more comprehensive and realistic benchmarks in future multimodal
time series forecasting research.

<details>

Motivation: 长序列下注意力机制计算复杂度高，且大多数注意力权重很小，切断反向传播可显著减少计算量。

Method: 提出基于概率的规则，通过参数c控制每个token和注意力头的反向传播交互数。

Result: 实验表明，切断99%的注意力梯度流仅增加1%的梯度方差，且计算复杂度降至线性。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效减少反向传播计算量，适用于长序列Transformer训练。

Abstract: It is straightforward to design an unbiased gradient estimator that
stochastically cuts the backpropagation flow through any part of a
computational graph. By cutting the parts that have little effect on the
computation, one can potentially save a significant amount of back-propagation
computation in exchange for a minimal increase in the stochastic gradient
variance, in some situations. Such a situation occurs in the attention
mechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention
becomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically
with sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very
small, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small
fraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising
targets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule
controlled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts backpropagation through most
attention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention
head. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the
attention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear
complexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical
transformer model, cutting $99\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing
$c \sim 20-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about
$1\%$ for $n \sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$. This approach is amenable
to efficient sparse matrix implementation, thus being promising for making the
cost of a backward pass negligible relative to the cost of a forward pass when
training a transformer model on long sequences.

Motivation: 传统RL算法独立奖励每个样本，忽略了样本集的多样性和集体效用，限制了探索和解决难题的能力。

Method: 提出PKPO，通过变换最终奖励直接优化pass@k性能，并推导了低方差无偏估计器。

Result: 实验验证了PKPO的有效性，能优化目标k值，解决更多难题，且通过调整k值提升pass@1和pass@k性能。

Conclusion: PKPO通过优化样本集的联合效用，显著提升了探索能力和任务解决效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms sample multiple n>1 solution attempts
for each problem and reward them independently. This optimizes for pass@1
performance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of
the diversity and collective utility of sets of samples. This under-utilizes
the sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder
examples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO), a
transformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of
pass@k performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward
when considered jointly. Our contribution is to derive novel low variance
unbiased estimators for pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and
continuous reward settings. We show optimization with our estimators reduces to
standard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and
efficient transformation function.
  While previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable
robust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k <= n. Moreover, instead of
trading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k
during training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1
numbers alongside significant pass@k gains.
  We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the
variance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world
examples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation
effectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable
solving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and
pass@k . Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1
optimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely due to
better exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual
samples.

Conclusion: ReGUIDE为GUI元素定位提供了一种数据高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
autonomous agents to interact with computers via Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs), where accurately localizing the coordinates of interface elements
(e.g., buttons) is often required for fine-grained actions. However, this
remains significantly challenging, leading prior works to rely on large-scale
web datasets to improve the grounding accuracy. In this work, we propose
Reasoning Graphical User Interface Grounding for Data Efficiency (ReGUIDE), a
novel and effective framework for web grounding that enables MLLMs to learn
data efficiently through self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism.
More specifically, ReGUIDE learns to (i) self-generate a language reasoning
process for the localization via online reinforcement learning, and (ii)
criticize the prediction using spatial priors that enforce equivariance under
input transformations. At inference time, ReGUIDE further boosts performance
through a test-time scaling strategy, which combines spatial search with
coordinate aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that ReGUIDE significantly
advances web grounding performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming
baselines with substantially fewer training data points (e.g., only 0.2%
samples compared to the best open-sourced baselines).

Conclusion: 基于价值的RL可能是增强LLM推理能力的有效替代方案，TBRM展示了其潜力和效率。

Abstract: Policy-based methods currently dominate reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines
for large language model (LLM) reasoning, leaving value-based approaches
largely unexplored. We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual
Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an
algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet
effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman
objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for
critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one
rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized
policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved
change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard
mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms
policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower
computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL
might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning
capabilities in LLMs.

Result: 实验证明Set-LLM能有效训练，性能与原模型相当或更好，同时消除顺序敏感性。

Conclusion: Set-LLM为解决LLMs的顺序敏感性问题提供了有效方案，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across
numerous applications, their robustness remains a critical concern. This paper
is motivated by a specific vulnerability: the order sensitivity of LLMs. This
vulnerability manifests itself as the order bias observed when LLMs decide
between possible options (for example, a preference for the first option) and
the tendency of LLMs to provide different answers when options are reordered.
The use cases for this scenario extend beyond the classical case of
multiple-choice question answering to the use of LLMs as automated evaluators
in AI pipelines, comparing output generated by different models. We introduce
Set-LLM, a novel architectural adaptation for pretrained LLMs that enables the
processing of mixed set-text inputs with permutation invariance guarantees. The
adaptations involve a new attention mask and new positional encodings
specifically designed for sets. We provide a theoretical proof of invariance
and demonstrate through experiments that Set-LLM can be trained effectively,
achieving comparable or improved performance and maintaining the runtime of the
original model, while eliminating order sensitivity.

Motivation: 研究神经网络中延迟泛化（grokking）现象的驱动因素，特别是在嵌入层的作用。

Method: 通过实验和分析，识别嵌入层更新的动态特性和双线性耦合机制，并提出频率感知采样和嵌入特定学习率的方法。

Result: 嵌入层是导致grokking的关键，提出的方法能够优化训练动态并加速收敛。

Conclusion: 嵌入层在grokking中起核心作用，提出的方法不仅改善grokking，还适用于Transformer的优化。

Abstract: Grokking, a delayed generalization in neural networks after perfect training
performance, has been observed in Transformers and MLPs, but the components
driving it remain underexplored. We show that embeddings are central to
grokking: introducing them into MLPs induces delayed generalization in modular
arithmetic tasks, whereas MLPs without embeddings can generalize immediately.
Our analysis identifies two key mechanisms: (1) Embedding update dynamics,
where rare tokens stagnate due to sparse gradient updates and weight decay, and
(2) Bilinear coupling, where the interaction between embeddings and downstream
weights introduces saddle points and increases sensitivity to initialization.
To confirm these mechanisms, we investigate frequency-aware sampling, which
balances token updates by minimizing gradient variance, and embedding-specific
learning rates, derived from the asymmetric curvature of the bilinear loss
landscape. We prove that an adaptive learning rate ratio,
\(\frac{\eta_E}{\eta_W} \propto \frac{\sigma_{\max}(E)}{\sigma_{\max}(W)} \cdot
\frac{f_W}{f_E}\), mitigates bilinear coupling effects, accelerating
convergence. Our methods not only improve grokking dynamics but also extend to
broader challenges in Transformer optimization, where bilinear interactions
hinder efficient training.

### [279] [Large Language Models as Computable Approximations to Solomonoff Induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15784)
*Jun Wan,Lingrui Mei*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 该论文首次将大语言模型（LLM）架构与算法信息论（AIT）建立正式联系，解释了LLM的涌现现象，并提出了一种基于预测置信度的少样本示例选择方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论框架对LLM行为的解释较为零散，缺乏统一的数学视角。论文旨在填补这一空白，为LLM的成功提供理论基础。

Method: 通过证明训练过程近似Solomonoff先验，以及下一词预测近似Solomonoff归纳，利用AIT统一解释上下文学习、少样本学习和缩放定律。

Result: 实验表明，基于预测置信度的少样本示例选择方法显著提升了性能，尤其是对小模型架构。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM的理论基础与实际行为之间架起桥梁，兼具解释力和实用性，为未来模型开发提供了指导。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) calls for a rigorous
theoretical framework to explain their empirical success. While significant
progress has been made in understanding LLM behaviors, existing theoretical
frameworks remain fragmented in explaining emergent phenomena through a unified
mathematical lens. We establish the first formal connection between LLM
architectures and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) by proving two
fundamental results: (1) the training process computationally approximates
Solomonoff prior through loss minimization interpreted as program length
optimization, and (2) next-token prediction implements approximate Solomonoff
induction. We leverage AIT to provide a unified theoretical explanation for
in-context learning, few-shot learning, and scaling laws. Furthermore, our
theoretical insights lead to a principled method for few-shot example selection
that prioritizes samples where models exhibit lower predictive confidence. We
demonstrate through experiments on diverse text classification benchmarks that
this strategy yields significant performance improvements, particularly for
smaller model architectures, when compared to selecting high-confidence
examples. Our framework bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and
practical LLM behaviors, providing both explanatory power and actionable
insights for future model development.

Main category: cs.CY

TLDR: AI技术可提升特殊教育需求儿童的包容性教育与临床康复效果，但需结合伦理框架与参与式研究。本文以ARTIS项目为例，提出一种结合伦理、教育、临床与技术专长的参与式研究策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI在特殊教育与康复中的潜力，同时解决其使用中的伦理与系统性挑战。

Method: 采用参与式研究策略，结合伦理、教育、临床与技术专长，通过焦点小组和协作设计会议实施。

Result: 提出了一种基于能力理论的AI技术设计框架，强调功能性与伦理责任。

Conclusion: 通过参与式研究，AI技术可更有效地支持包容性教育，弥合技术创新与伦理责任间的差距。

Abstract: AI-based technologies have significant potential to enhance inclusive
education and clinical-rehabilitative contexts for children with Special
Educational Needs and Disabilities. AI can enhance learning experiences,
empower students, and support both teachers and rehabilitators. However, their
usage presents challenges that require a systemic-ecological vision, ethical
considerations, and participatory research. Therefore, research and
technological development must be rooted in a strong ethical-theoretical
framework. The Capability Approach - a theoretical model of disability, human
vulnerability, and inclusion - offers a more relevant perspective on
functionality, effectiveness, and technological adequacy in inclusive learning
environments. In this paper, we propose a participatory research strategy with
different stakeholders through a case study on the ARTIS Project, which
develops an AI-enriched interface to support children with text comprehension
difficulties. Our research strategy integrates ethical, educational, clinical,
and technological expertise in designing and implementing AI-based technologies
for children's learning environments through focus groups and collaborative
design sessions. We believe that this holistic approach to AI adoption in
education can help bridge the gap between technological innovation and ethical
responsibility.

TLDR: 研究发现，基于LLM的评估系统（如GPT-4o和Llama 3 70B）对伦理拒绝的评分显著高于人类用户，而对技术拒绝的评分则无显著差异，揭示了模型评估中的‘调节偏见’。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在伦理敏感提示下的拒绝行为如何被模型评估系统与人类用户评价，以揭示自动化评估中的潜在偏见。

Method: 利用Chatbot Arena数据和两种AI评估模型（GPT-4o和Llama 3 70B）比较伦理拒绝与技术拒绝的评分差异。

Result: 模型评估系统对伦理拒绝的评分显著高于人类用户，而对技术拒绝的评分无显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型评估中的‘调节偏见’，引发对自动化评估系统的透明度、价值对齐和规范性假设的思考。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
settings, their ability to refuse ethically sensitive prompts-such as those
involving hate speech or illegal activities-has become central to content
moderation and responsible AI practices. While refusal responses can be viewed
as evidence of ethical alignment and safety-conscious behavior, recent research
suggests that users may perceive them negatively. At the same time, automated
assessments of model outputs are playing a growing role in both evaluation and
training. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks-in which one model is used
to evaluate the output of another-are now widely adopted to guide benchmarking
and fine-tuning. This paper examines whether such model-based evaluators assess
refusal responses differently than human users. Drawing on data from Chatbot
Arena and judgments from two AI judges (GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B), we compare how
different types of refusals are rated. We distinguish ethical refusals, which
explicitly cite safety or normative concerns (e.g., "I can't help with that
because it may be harmful"), and technical refusals, which reflect system
limitations (e.g., "I can't answer because I lack real-time data"). We find
that LLM-as-a-Judge systems evaluate ethical refusals significantly more
favorably than human users, a divergence not observed for technical refusals.
We refer to this divergence as a moderation bias-a systematic tendency for
model-based evaluators to reward refusal behaviors more than human users do.
This raises broader questions about transparency, value alignment, and the
normative assumptions embedded in automated evaluation systems.

TLDR: HDLxGraph框架通过结合Graph RAG与LLMs，利用AST和DFG提升硬件设计任务的性能，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在大型HDL项目中性能不足的问题。

Method: 提出HDLxGraph框架，整合Graph RAG与LLMs，引入AST和DFG的双重检索机制。

Result: 平均搜索准确率、调试效率和完成质量分别提升12.04%、12.22%和5.04%。

Conclusion: HDLxGraph在硬件设计任务中表现优异，并提供了HDLSearch基准数据集。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in hardware
design tasks, such as Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation and
debugging. Yet, their performance in real-world, repository-level HDL projects
with thousands or even tens of thousands of code lines is hindered. To this
end, we propose HDLxGraph, a novel framework that integrates Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) with LLMs, introducing HDL-specific graph
representations by incorporating Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and Data Flow
Graphs (DFGs) to capture both code graph view and hardware graph view.
HDLxGraph utilizes a dual-retrieval mechanism that not only mitigates the
limited recall issues inherent in similarity-based semantic retrieval by
incorporating structural information, but also enhances its extensibility to
various real-world tasks by a task-specific retrieval finetuning. Additionally,
to address the lack of comprehensive HDL search benchmarks, we introduce
HDLSearch, a multi-granularity evaluation dataset derived from real-world
repository-level projects. Experimental results demonstrate that HDLxGraph
significantly improves average search accuracy, debugging efficiency and
completion quality by 12.04%, 12.22% and 5.04% compared to similarity-based
RAG, respectively. The code of HDLxGraph and collected HDLSearch benchmark are

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的颅内动脉瘤血流动力学分析方法，通过合成大规模高保真CFD数据集，解决了传统CFD方法计算复杂的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颅内动脉瘤（IAs）破裂风险高，现有评估方法主要关注形态学和患者特异性因素，血流动力学影响尚不明确。传统CFD方法计算量大，难以用于大规模或实时临床应用。

Method: 基于427个真实动脉瘤几何形状，通过控制变形合成了10,660个3D形状模拟动脉瘤演变，生成了85,280个血流动力学数据，并提供了分割掩模和多模态数据支持。

Result: 数据集和基准测试支持高效机器学习算法的开发，可用于生物流体、生物医学工程和临床风险评估。

Conclusion: 该数据集和代码的公开将推动动脉瘤研究和数据驱动方法的应用。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are serious cerebrovascular lesions found in
approximately 5\% of the general population. Their rupture may lead to high
mortality. Current methods for assessing IA risk focus on morphological and
patient-specific factors, but the hemodynamic influences on IA development and
rupture remain unclear. While accurate for hemodynamic studies, conventional
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are computationally intensive,
hindering their deployment in large-scale or real-time clinical applications.
To address this challenge, we curated a large-scale, high-fidelity aneurysm CFD
dataset to facilitate the development of efficient machine learning algorithms
for such applications. Based on 427 real aneurysm geometries, we synthesized
10,660 3D shapes via controlled deformation to simulate aneurysm evolution. The
authenticity of these synthetic shapes was confirmed by neurosurgeons. CFD
computations were performed on each shape under eight steady-state mass flow
conditions, generating a total of 85,280 blood flow dynamics data covering key
parameters. Furthermore, the dataset includes segmentation masks, which can
support tasks that use images, point clouds or other multimodal data as input.
Additionally, we introduced a benchmark for estimating flow parameters to
assess current modeling methods. This dataset aims to advance aneurysm research
and promote data-driven approaches in biofluids, biomedical engineering, and
clinical risk assessment. The code and dataset are available at:

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在医学领域生成描述时表现不佳，需要针对性改进。

Method: 微调BLIP模型，并与零样本版本、BLIP-2及ViT-GPT2基线对比，分析编码器和解码器微调的贡献。

Result: 领域特定微调显著提升性能，解码器微调（编码器冻结）在训练时间减少5%的同时表现良好，全模型微调效果最佳。

Conclusion: 医学应用中目标适应至关重要，解码器微调是高效选择，全模型微调效果最优。

Abstract: Medical image captioning is a challenging task that requires generating
clinically accurate and semantically meaningful descriptions of radiology
images. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) such as BLIP, BLIP2, Gemini
and ViT-GPT2 show strong performance on natural image datasets, they often
produce generic or imprecise captions when applied to specialized medical
domains. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning the BLIP
model on the ROCO dataset for improved radiology captioning. We compare the
fine-tuned BLIP against its zero-shot version, BLIP-2 base, BLIP-2 Instruct and
a ViT-GPT2 transformer baseline. Our results demonstrate that domain-specific
fine-tuning on BLIP significantly improves performance across both quantitative
and qualitative evaluation metrics. We also visualize decoder cross-attention
maps to assess interpretability and conduct an ablation study to evaluate the
contributions of encoder-only and decoder-only fine-tuning. Our findings
highlight the importance of targeted adaptation for medical applications and
suggest that decoder-only fine-tuning (encoder-frozen) offers a strong
performance baseline with 5% lower training time than full fine-tuning, while
full model fine-tuning still yields the best results overall.

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction of buildings, particularly at Level of
Detail 1 (LOD1), plays a crucial role in various applications such as urban
planning, urban environmental studies, and designing optimized transportation
networks. This study focuses on assessing the potential of LiDAR data for
accurate 3D building reconstruction at LOD1 and extracting morphological
features from these models. Four deep semantic segmentation models, U-Net,
Attention U-Net, U-Net3+, and DeepLabV3+, were used, applying transfer learning
to extract building footprints from LiDAR data. The results showed that U-Net3+
and Attention U-Net outperformed the others, achieving IoU scores of 0.833 and
0.814, respectively. Various statistical measures, including maximum, range,
mode, median, and the 90th percentile, were used to estimate building heights,
resulting in the generation of 3D models at LOD1. As the main contribution of
the research, the impact of segmentation accuracy on the quality of 3D building
modeling and the accuracy of morphological features like building area and
external wall surface area was investigated. The results showed that the
accuracy of building identification (segmentation performance) significantly
affects the 3D model quality and the estimation of morphological features,
depending on the height calculation method. Overall, the UNet3+ method,
utilizing the 90th percentile and median measures, leads to accurate height
estimation of buildings and the extraction of morphological features.

TLDR: TransMedSeg提出了一种新的半监督医学图像分割框架，通过跨域分布匹配和域内结构保留增强特征表示，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前半监督学习方法在医学图像分割中忽略跨临床领域和成像模态的可转移语义关系。

Method: 引入可转移语义增强（TSA）模块，通过轻量级记忆模块隐式对齐域不变语义，构建统一特征空间。

Result: 在医学图像数据集上表现优于现有半监督方法。

Conclusion: TransMedSeg为医学图像分析中的可转移表示学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved significant progress in medical
image segmentation (SSMIS) through effective utilization of limited labeled
data. While current SSL methods for medical images predominantly rely on
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling, they often overlook
transferable semantic relationships across different clinical domains and
imaging modalities. To address this, we propose TransMedSeg, a novel
transferable semantic framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.
Our approach introduces a Transferable Semantic Augmentation (TSA) module,
which implicitly enhances feature representations by aligning domain-invariant
semantics through cross-domain distribution matching and intra-domain
structural preservation. Specifically, TransMedSeg constructs a unified feature
space where teacher network features are adaptively augmented towards student
network semantics via a lightweight memory module, enabling implicit semantic
transformation without explicit data generation. Interestingly, this
augmentation is implicitly realized through an expected transferable
cross-entropy loss computed over the augmented teacher distribution. An upper
bound of the expected loss is theoretically derived and minimized during
training, incurring negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on
medical image datasets demonstrate that TransMedSeg outperforms existing
semi-supervised methods, establishing a new direction for transferable
representation learning in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Accurately tracking particles and determining their position along the
optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when
extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning
approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial
positions from dual-focal plane images without relying on predefined models.
Our method achieves an axial localization accuracy of 40 nanometers - six times
better than traditional single-focal plane techniques. The model's simple
design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses,
including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation
protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging,
materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how
machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise
information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific
applications.

Abstract: We propose an OCT super-resolution framework based on a plug-and-play

as an inverse problem, combining a diffusion prior with Markov chain Monte

pipeline to build realistic training pairs. Evaluations on in vivo and ex vivo

baselines, producing sharper structures and better noise suppression. This
approach advances high-fidelity OCT imaging in high-speed acquisition for
clinical applications.

Conclusion: 方法对采样模式、解剖变化和扫描协议具有普适性，仅需低频采样。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly susceptible to motion artifacts
due to the extended acquisition times required for k-space sampling. These
artifacts can compromise diagnostic utility, particularly for dynamic imaging.
We propose a novel alternating minimization framework that leverages a bespoke
diffusion model to jointly reconstruct and correct non-rigid motion-corrupted
k-space data. The diffusion model uses a coarse-to-fine denoising strategy to
capture large overall motion and reconstruct the lower frequencies of the image
first, providing a better inductive bias for motion estimation than that of
standard diffusion models. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on
both real-world cine cardiac MRI datasets and complex simulated rigid and
non-rigid deformations, even when each motion state is undersampled by a factor
of 64x. Additionally, our method is agnostic to sampling patterns, anatomical
variations, and MRI scanning protocols, as long as some low frequency
components are sampled during each motion state.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在肺结节检测中表现出色，证明了自监督学习在医学影像分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains among the deadliest types of cancer in recent decades,
and early lung nodule detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The
limited availability of annotated medical imaging data remains a bottleneck in
developing accurate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Self-supervised
learning can help leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to develop more
robust CAD systems. With the recent advent of transformer-based architecture
and their ability to generalize to unseen tasks, there has been an effort
within the healthcare community to adapt them to various medical downstream
tasks. Thus, we propose a novel "LungNodule-SSM" method, which utilizes
selfsupervised learning with DINOv2 as a backbone to enhance lung nodule
detection and classification without annotated data. Our methodology has two
stages: firstly, the DINOv2 model is pre-trained on unlabeled CT scans to learn
robust feature representations, then secondly, these features are fine-tuned
using transformer-based architectures for lesionlevel detection and accurate
lung nodule diagnosis. The proposed method has been evaluated on the
challenging LUNA 16 dataset, consisting of 888 CT scans, and compared with SOTA
methods. Our experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method
with an accuracy of 98.37%, explaining its effectiveness in lung nodule
detection. The source code, datasets, and pre-processed data can be accessed

Method: 结合神经振荡模型和多视图GNN，从系统动力学角度学习SC-FC耦合，并进行分类。

Result: 在临床数据集上表现优异，验证了方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解SZ的SC-FC关系提供了新视角，并提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Clinical studies reveal disruptions in brain structural connectivity (SC) and
functional connectivity (FC) in neuropsychiatric disorders such as
schizophrenia (SZ). Traditional approaches might rely solely on SC due to
limited functional data availability, hindering comprehension of cognitive and
behavioral impairments in individuals with SZ by neglecting the intricate SC-FC
interrelationship. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel physics-guided
deep learning framework that leverages a neural oscillation model to describe
the dynamics of a collection of interconnected neural oscillators, which
operate via nerve fibers dispersed across the brain's structure. Our proposed
framework utilizes SC to simultaneously generate FC by learning SC-FC coupling
from a system dynamics perspective. Additionally, it employs a novel multi-view
graph neural network (GNN) with a joint loss to perform correlation-based SC-FC
fusion and classification of individuals with SZ. Experiments conducted on a
clinical dataset exhibited improved performance, demonstrating the robustness
of our proposed approach.

*Saqib Qamar,Mohd Fazil,Parvez Ahmad,Ghulam Muhammad*

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: SAMA-UNet提出了一种新型医学图像分割架构，通过SAMA块和CR-MSM模块解决了现有模型的计算效率低和复杂数据处理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在医学图像分割中存在计算效率低和对复杂数据处理能力不足的问题，SSMs虽在长程依赖建模中表现优异，但在图像分割中应用受限。

Method: 提出SAMA-UNet架构，包括SAMA块（结合上下文自注意力和动态权重调制）和CR-MSM模块（通过因果共振学习增强信息流动）。

Result: 在MRI、CT和内窥镜图像上的实验表明，SAMA-UNet在分割精度上优于CNN、Transformer和Mamba等方法。

Conclusion: SAMA-UNet通过创新设计显著提升了医学图像分割的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in various clinical
applications, but existing models often struggle with the computational
inefficiencies and challenges posed by complex medical data. State Space
Sequence Models (SSMs) have demonstrated promise in modeling long-range
dependencies with linear computational complexity, yet their application in
medical image segmentation remains hindered by incompatibilities with image
tokens and autoregressive assumptions. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve a
balance in capturing both local fine-grained information and global semantic
dependencies. To address these challenges, we introduce SAMA-UNet, a novel
architecture for medical image segmentation. A key innovation is the
Self-Adaptive Mamba-like Aggregated Attention (SAMA) block, which integrates
contextual self-attention with dynamic weight modulation to prioritise the most
relevant features based on local and global contexts. This approach reduces
computational complexity and improves the representation of complex image
features across multiple scales. We also suggest the Causal-Resonance
Multi-Scale Module (CR-MSM), which enhances the flow of information between the
encoder and decoder by using causal resonance learning. This mechanism allows
the model to automatically adjust feature resolution and causal dependencies
across scales, leading to better semantic alignment between the low-level and
high-level features in U-shaped architectures. Experiments on MRI, CT, and
endoscopy images show that SAMA-UNet performs better in segmentation accuracy
than current methods using CNN, Transformer, and Mamba. The implementation is
publicly available at GitHub.

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: X-GRM是一种基于Transformer的大规模前馈模型，用于从稀疏2D X射线投影重建3D CT，采用Voxel-based Gaussian Splatting表示，并利用大规模数据集ReconX-15K进行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CT重建方法受限于小容量模型架构、不灵活的体素表示和小规模训练数据，无法满足高质量重建需求。

Method: X-GRM采用可扩展的Transformer架构编码稀疏X射线输入，并通过Voxel-based Gaussian Splatting解码为高效CT体素表示。

Result: 模型在多样化的测试输入（包括域内和域外X射线投影）中实现了高质量重建。

Conclusion: X-GRM通过高容量模型、灵活体素表示和大规模数据集的结合，显著提升了CT重建质量。

Abstract: Computed Tomography serves as an indispensable tool in clinical workflows,
providing non-invasive visualization of internal anatomical structures.
Existing CT reconstruction works are limited to small-capacity model
architecture, inflexible volume representation, and small-scale training data.
In this paper, we present X-GRM (X-ray Gaussian Reconstruction Model), a large
feedforward model for reconstructing 3D CT from sparse-view 2D X-ray
projections. X-GRM employs a scalable transformer-based architecture to encode
an arbitrary number of sparse X-ray inputs, where tokens from different views
are integrated efficiently. Then, tokens are decoded into a new volume
representation, named Voxel-based Gaussian Splatting (VoxGS), which enables
efficient CT volume extraction and differentiable X-ray rendering. To support
the training of X-GRM, we collect ReconX-15K, a large-scale CT reconstruction
dataset containing around 15,000 CT/X-ray pairs across diverse organs,
including the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and tooth etc. This combination of a
high-capacity model, flexible volume representation, and large-scale training
data empowers our model to produce high-quality reconstructions from various
testing inputs, including in-domain and out-domain X-ray projections. Project

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于自适应模板的网格重建网络（ATMRN），通过生成自适应模板提升重建精度，优于传统固定模板方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网格重建方法依赖固定模板，忽略了受试者间的解剖差异，影响重建精度。

Method: 提出ATMRN，从图像生成自适应模板用于后续变形，避免固定模板的限制。

Result: 在OASIS数据集的皮质MR图像上验证，平均对称表面距离为0.267mm，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ATMRN方法通用性强，可扩展至其他图像模态和解剖结构。

Abstract: Mesh reconstruction is a cornerstone process across various applications,
including in-silico trials, digital twins, surgical planning, and navigation.
Recent advancements in deep learning have notably enhanced mesh reconstruction
speeds. Yet, traditional methods predominantly rely on deforming a standardised
template mesh for individual subjects, which overlooks the unique anatomical
variations between them, and may compromise the fidelity of the
reconstructions. In this paper, we propose an adaptive-template-based mesh
reconstruction network (ATMRN), which generates adaptive templates from the
given images for the subsequent deformation, moving beyond the constraints of a
singular, fixed template. Our approach, validated on cortical magnetic
resonance (MR) images from the OASIS dataset, sets a new benchmark in
voxel-to-cortex mesh reconstruction, achieving an average symmetric surface
distance of 0.267mm across four cortical structures. Our proposed method is
generic and can be easily transferred to other image modalities and anatomical
structures.

TLDR: 提出了一种多分辨率融合深度学习架构，用于宫颈癌细胞检测，性能接近SOTA，参数更少，并引入多任务学习和概率风险评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宫颈癌是全球女性第四大癌症，需通过Pap涂片早期检测预防。

Method: 使用多分辨率融合卷积网络处理不同分辨率图像，结合多任务学习进行分割和分类。

Result: 模型性能接近SOTA，参数减少85倍，分割IoU为0.83，分类准确率90%。

Conclusion: 方法有效且高效，可用于宫颈癌预后风险评估。

Abstract: Cervical cancer, the fourth leading cause of cancer in women globally,
requires early detection through Pap smear tests to identify precancerous
changes and prevent disease progression. In this study, we performed a focused
analysis by segmenting the cellular boundaries and drawing bounding boxes to
isolate the cancer cells. A novel Deep Learning (DL) architecture, the
``Multi-Resolution Fusion Deep Convolutional Network", was proposed to
effectively handle images with varying resolutions and aspect ratios, with its
efficacy showcased using the SIPaKMeD dataset. The performance of this DL model
was observed to be similar to the state-of-the-art models, with accuracy
variations of a mere 2\% to 3\%, achieved using just 1.7 million learnable
parameters, which is approximately 85 times less than the VGG-19 model.
Furthermore, we introduced a multi-task learning technique that simultaneously
performs segmentation and classification tasks and begets an Intersection over
Union score of 0.83 and a classification accuracy of 90\%. The final stage of
the workflow employs a probabilistic approach for risk assessment, extracting
feature vectors to predict the likelihood of normal cells progressing to
malignant states, which can be utilized for the prognosis of cervical cancer.

TLDR: 该研究开发了一个名为LCP1.0的病理生物学词典，用于将复杂的病理组学和影像组学特征转化为临床可解释的指标，以提升AI在肝癌诊断中的透明度和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医学诊断中潜力巨大，但缺乏可解释性和泛化性限制了其临床应用。本研究旨在通过开发LCP1.0词典，弥合AI输出与临床解释之间的差距。

Method: 使用QuPath和PyRadiomics提取肝癌组织的333个影像特征，并通过特征选择算法和SVM模型评估其与WHO分级系统的相关性。

Result: SVM模型结合特征选择算法达到最高准确率（0.80），筛选出20个关键特征，主要与肿瘤分级和预后相关。

Conclusion: LCP1.0为AI输出与临床解释提供了桥梁，增强了模型的透明度和实用性，支持开发可解释的肝癌诊断工具。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds strong potential for medical diagnostics,
yet its clinical adoption is limited by a lack of interpretability and
generalizability. This study introduces the Pathobiological Dictionary for
Liver Cancer (LCP1.0), a practical framework designed to translate complex
Pathomics and Radiomics Features (PF and RF) into clinically meaningful
insights aligned with existing diagnostic workflows. QuPath and PyRadiomics,
standardized according to IBSI guidelines, were used to extract 333 imaging
features from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue samples, including 240
PF-based-cell detection/intensity, 74 RF-based texture, and 19 RF-based
first-order features. Expert-defined ROIs from the public dataset excluded
artifact-prone areas, and features were aggregated at the case level. Their
relevance to the WHO grading system was assessed using multiple classifiers
linked with feature selectors. The resulting dictionary was validated by 8
experts in oncology and pathology. In collaboration with 10 domain experts, we
developed a Pathobiological dictionary of imaging features such as PFs and RF.
In our study, the Variable Threshold feature selection algorithm combined with
the SVM model achieved the highest accuracy (0.80, P-value less than 0.05),
selecting 20 key features, primarily clinical and pathomics traits such as
Centroid, Cell Nucleus, and Cytoplasmic characteristics. These features,
particularly nuclear and cytoplasmic, were strongly associated with tumor
grading and prognosis, reflecting atypia indicators like pleomorphism,
hyperchromasia, and cellular orientation.The LCP1.0 provides a clinically
validated bridge between AI outputs and expert interpretation, enhancing model
transparency and usability. Aligning AI-derived features with clinical
semantics supports the development of interpretable, trustworthy diagnostic
tools for liver cancer pathology.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的正则化方法DF-FLOPS，用于减少高文档频率（DF）术语的使用，从而降低检索延迟，同时保持检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高DF术语在检索引擎中会增加延迟，现有方法如FLOPS正则化无法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出DF-FLOPS正则化技术，惩罚高DF术语的使用，缩短发布列表并降低延迟。

Result: DF-FLOPS显著减少了高DF术语的流行，检索延迟降低约10倍，同时保持检索效果。

Conclusion: DF-FLOPS是使LSR模型适用于生产级搜索引擎的重要一步，其检索延迟与BM25相当。

Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) models encode text as weighted term vectors,
which need to be sparse to leverage inverted index structures during retrieval.
SPLADE, the most popular LSR model, uses FLOPS regularization to encourage
vector sparsity during training. However, FLOPS regularization does not ensure
sparsity among terms - only within a given query or document. Terms with very
high Document Frequencies (DFs) substantially increase latency in production
retrieval engines, such as Apache Solr, due to their lengthy posting lists. To
address the issue of high DFs, we present a new variant of FLOPS
regularization: DF-FLOPS. This new regularization technique penalizes the usage
of high-DF terms, thereby shortening posting lists and reducing retrieval
latency. Unlike other inference-time sparsification methods, such as stopword
removal, DF-FLOPS regularization allows for the selective inclusion of
high-frequency terms in cases where the terms are truly salient. We find that
DF-FLOPS successfully reduces the prevalence of high-DF terms and lowers
retrieval latency (around 10x faster) in a production-grade engine while
maintaining effectiveness both in-domain (only a 2.2-point drop in MRR@10) and
cross-domain (improved performance in 12 out of 13 tasks on which we tested).
With retrieval latencies on par with BM25, this work provides an important step
towards making LSR practical for deployment in production-grade search engines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学信息检索（MIR）在多个应用中至关重要，但缺乏统一的评估基准。

Method: 提出MIRB基准，包含四个任务（语义陈述检索、问答检索、前提检索和公式检索）和12个数据集，评估了13个检索模型。

Result: 通过MIRB评估了13个模型，并分析了MIR的挑战。

Conclusion: MIRB为评估MIR系统提供了全面框架，有助于推动针对数学领域的检索模型发展。

Abstract: Mathematical Information Retrieval (MIR) is the task of retrieving
information from mathematical documents and plays a key role in various
applications, including theorem search in mathematical libraries, answer
retrieval on math forums, and premise selection in automated theorem proving.
However, a unified benchmark for evaluating these diverse retrieval tasks has
been lacking. In this paper, we introduce MIRB (Mathematical Information
Retrieval Benchmark) to assess the MIR capabilities of retrieval models. MIRB
includes four tasks: semantic statement retrieval, question-answer retrieval,
premise retrieval, and formula retrieval, spanning a total of 12 datasets. We
evaluate 13 retrieval models on this benchmark and analyze the challenges
inherent to MIR. We hope that MIRB provides a comprehensive framework for
evaluating MIR systems and helps advance the development of more effective
retrieval models tailored to the mathematical domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ComBAT作为MRI数据协调的标准方法存在假设条件，当这些假设不满足时可能导致协调失败。本文旨在探讨这些假设的影响并提出改进方案。

Method: 通过实验评估了改进版Pairwise-ComBAT在不同人口特征下的表现，包括样本量、年龄分布、缺失协变量及偏差大小。

Result: 实验揭示了ComBAT假设的局限性，并提出了五项关键建议以提高协调的一致性和可重复性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在开放科学和临床应用中优化ComBAT方法的重要性，并提供了具体建议。

Abstract: Over the years, ComBAT has become the standard method for harmonizing
MRI-derived measurements, with its ability to compensate for site-related
additive and multiplicative biases while preserving biological variability.
However, ComBAT relies on a set of assumptions that, when violated, can result
in flawed harmonization. In this paper, we thoroughly review ComBAT's
mathematical foundation, outlining these assumptions, and exploring their
implications for the demographic composition necessary for optimal results.
  Through a series of experiments involving a slightly modified version of
ComBAT called Pairwise-ComBAT tailored for normative modeling applications, we
assess the impact of various population characteristics, including population
size, age distribution, the absence of certain covariates, and the magnitude of
additive and multiplicative factors. Based on these experiments, we present
five essential recommendations that should be carefully considered to enhance
consistency and supporting reproducibility, two essential factors for open
science, collaborative research, and real-life clinical deployment.

TLDR: QUADS是一个统一框架，通过多阶段训练优化蒸馏和量化，在资源受限环境中高效实现SLU任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别应用蒸馏和量化，导致压缩效果不佳，QUADS旨在统一优化两者。

Method: QUADS采用多阶段训练，结合预调模型，适应低比特量化并保持准确性。

Result: 在SLURP和FSC上分别达到71.13%和99.20%准确率，计算复杂度降低60-73倍，模型大小减少83-700倍。

Conclusion: QUADS是资源受限SLU应用的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) systems must balance performance and
efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Existing methods
apply distillation and quantization separately, leading to suboptimal
compression as distillation ignores quantization constraints. We propose QUADS,
a unified framework that optimizes both through multi-stage training with a
pre-tuned model, enhancing adaptability to low-bit regimes while maintaining
accuracy. QUADS achieves 71.13\% accuracy on SLURP and 99.20\% on FSC, with
only minor degradations of up to 5.56\% compared to state-of-the-art models.
Additionally, it reduces computational complexity by 60--73$\times$ (GMACs) and
model size by 83--700$\times$, demonstrating strong robustness under extreme
quantization. These results establish QUADS as a highly efficient solution for
real-world, resource-constrained SLU applications.

TLDR: TCSinger 2是一个多任务、多语言的零样本歌声合成模型，通过风格迁移和多级提示控制解决了现有模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌声合成模型过度依赖音素和音符边界标注，导致零样本场景下鲁棒性不足且音素与音符间过渡不自然，同时缺乏有效的多级风格控制。

Method: TCSinger 2包含三个关键模块：模糊边界内容编码器（BBC）、自定义音频编码器和基于流的自定义Transformer（Cus-MOE），分别处理平滑过渡、多模态对齐和高质量合成。

Result: 实验表明，TCSinger 2在主观和客观指标上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: TCSinger 2通过多任务设计和风格控制，显著提升了零样本歌声合成的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: Customizable multilingual zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) has various
potential applications in music composition and short video dubbing. However,
existing SVS models overly depend on phoneme and note boundary annotations,
limiting their robustness in zero-shot scenarios and producing poor transitions
between phonemes and notes. Moreover, they also lack effective multi-level
style control via diverse prompts. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
TCSinger 2, a multi-task multilingual zero-shot SVS model with style transfer
and style control based on various prompts. TCSinger 2 mainly includes three
key modules: 1) Blurred Boundary Content (BBC) Encoder, predicts duration,
extends content embedding, and applies masking to the boundaries to enable
smooth transitions. 2) Custom Audio Encoder, uses contrastive learning to
extract aligned representations from singing, speech, and textual prompts. 3)
Flow-based Custom Transformer, leverages Cus-MOE, with F0 supervision,
enhancing both the synthesis quality and style modeling of the generated
singing voice. Experimental results show that TCSinger 2 outperforms baseline
models in both subjective and objective metrics across multiple related tasks.

*Nicholas Sanders,Yuanchao Li,Korin Richmond,Simon King*

Main category: eess.AS

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Segmentation-Variant Codebooks (SVCs)的方法，用于在SSL语音模型中量化语音，通过在不同语言单元（帧、音素、单词、话语）上量化语音，有效保留韵律和副语言信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的量化方法在SSL语音模型中虽然提高了压缩和性能，但往往丢失了韵律和副语言信息（如情感、重音）。增加码本大小虽能缓解部分信息丢失，但会低效地提高比特率。

Method: 提出Segmentation-Variant Codebooks (SVCs)，将语音在不同语言单元上量化，分解为多个特定于片段的离散特征流。

Result: SVCs在多项探测任务中显著更有效地保留了韵律和副语言信息。此外，在离散化之前而非之后进行池化能更好地保留片段级信息。

Conclusion: SVCs在保留可理解性的同时，改进了风格实现和略微提高了质量，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Quantization in SSL speech models (e.g., HuBERT) improves compression and
performance in tasks like language modeling, resynthesis, and text-to-speech
but often discards prosodic and paralinguistic information (e.g., emotion,
prominence). While increasing codebook size mitigates some loss, it
inefficiently raises bitrates. We propose Segmentation-Variant Codebooks
(SVCs), which quantize speech at distinct linguistic units (frame, phone, word,
utterance), factorizing it into multiple streams of segment-specific discrete
features. Our results show that SVCs are significantly more effective at
preserving prosodic and paralinguistic information across probing tasks.
Additionally, we find that pooling before rather than after discretization
better retains segment-level information. Resynthesis experiments further
confirm improved style realization and slightly improved quality while
preserving intelligibility.

Conclusion: ToxicTone数据集和多模态框架为普通话语音毒性检测提供了有效工具，强调了语音特征的关键作用。

Abstract: Despite extensive research on toxic speech detection in text, a critical gap
remains in handling spoken Mandarin audio. The lack of annotated datasets that
capture the unique prosodic cues and culturally specific expressions in
Mandarin leaves spoken toxicity underexplored. To address this, we introduce
ToxicTone -- the largest public dataset of its kind -- featuring detailed
annotations that distinguish both forms of toxicity (e.g., profanity, bullying)
and sources of toxicity (e.g., anger, sarcasm, dismissiveness). Our data,
sourced from diverse real-world audio and organized into 13 topical categories,
mirrors authentic communication scenarios. We also propose a multimodal
detection framework that integrates acoustic, linguistic, and emotional
features using state-of-the-art speech and emotion encoders. Extensive
experiments show our approach outperforms text-only and baseline models,
underscoring the essential role of speech-specific cues in revealing hidden
toxic expressions.
