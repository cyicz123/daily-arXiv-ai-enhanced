### [1] [Guiding Giants: Lightweight Controllers for Weighted Activation Steering in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20309)
*Amr Hegazy,Mostafa Elhoushi,Amr Alanwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出一种轻量级可训练控制器网络，动态调节LLM激活以实现细粒度、自适应的推理时控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏细粒度和自适应机制，无法有效控制LLM生成不安全内容或违反安全准则的行为。

Method: 集成轻量级控制器网络，通过观察中间激活预测全局缩放因子和层特定权重，动态调节预计算的拒绝方向向量。

Result: 在ToxicChat和In-The-Wild Jailbreak Prompts等基准测试中，显著提高拒绝率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需修改原始模型参数，实现了高效、自适应的LLM行为控制。

Abstract: Controlling undesirable Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors, such as the
generation of unsafe content or failing to adhere to safety guidelines, often
relies on costly fine-tuning. Activation steering provides an alternative for
inference-time control, but existing methods typically lack fine-grained,
adaptive mechanisms. We introduce a novel approach using a lightweight,
trainable controller network integrated during inference. This controller
network observes specific intermediate LLM activations and predicts both a
global scaling factor and layer-specific weights. The predicted global scaling
factor and layer-specific weights then dynamically modulate the intensity of a
steering patch, derived from a pre-computed "refusal direction" vector, applied
across the LLM's layers during generation. Trained on activations from both
harmful and benign prompts, our controller learns to discriminatively apply
nuanced, layer-aware interventions, activating steering primarily for harmful
inputs. Experiments using safety benchmarks like ToxicChat & In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts demonstrate that our weighted steering controller
significantly increases refusal rates compared to the base LLM, achieving
targeted behavioral modification without altering the original model
parameters. Our experiments with Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.2-1B & Mistral-7B show
our approach outperforms existing methods, presenting an efficient and adaptive
method for fine-grained control over LLM behavior at inference time.

### [2] [Arctic-Text2SQL-R1: Simple Rewards, Strong Reasoning in Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20315)
*Zhewei Yao,Guoheng Sun,Lukasz Borchmann,Zheyu Shen,Minghang Deng,Bohan Zhai,Hao Zhang,Ang Li,Yuxiong He*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: Arctic-Text2SQL-R1是一个基于强化学习的框架，旨在生成准确且可执行的SQL查询，通过轻量级奖励信号实现高效训练，并在多个基准测试中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言转SQL（Test2SQL）是一个长期挑战，尽管大型语言模型提高了SQL生成的流畅性，但生成正确且可执行的SQL（尤其是复杂查询）仍是瓶颈。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，仅基于执行正确性的轻量级奖励信号，避免脆弱的中间监督和复杂奖励设计，结合精选数据、强监督初始化和有效训练实践。

Result: 在六个Test2SQL基准测试中取得最佳执行准确率，7B模型性能超越之前70B级系统，展示了框架的可扩展性和高效性。

Conclusion: 通过简单扩展（如值检索和多数投票）增强推理鲁棒性，实验和消融研究为未来Test2SQL研究提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Test2SQL) is a longstanding challenge
at the intersection of natural language understanding and structured data
access. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved fluency
in SQL generation, producing correct and executable SQL--particularly for
complex queries--remains a bottleneck. We present Arctic-Text2SQL-R1, a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework and model family designed to generate
accurate, executable SQL using a lightweight reward signal based solely on
execution correctness. Our approach avoids brittle intermediate supervision and
complex reward shaping, promoting stable training and alignment with the end
task. Combined with carefully curated data, strong supervised initialization,
and effective training practices, Arctic-Text2SQL-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
execution accuracy across six diverse Test2SQL benchmarks, including the top
position on the BIRD leaderboard. Notably, our 7B model outperforms prior
70B-class systems, highlighting the framework's scalability and efficiency. We
further demonstrate inference-time robustness through simple extensions like
value retrieval and majority voting. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
offer both positive and negative insights, providing practical guidance for
future Test2SQL research.

### [3] [Beyond Demonstrations: Dynamic Vector Construction from Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20318)
*Wang Cai,Hsiu-Yuan Huang,Zhixiang Wang,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: DyVec是一种动态向量方法，通过改进ICV方法的局限性，显著提升了任务适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICV方法对ICL特定因素敏感，表示粗糙且依赖启发式注入位置，限制了其适用性。

Method: DyVec采用EQR策略提取鲁棒语义表示，动态分割与注入，并利用REINFORCE优化注入位置。

Result: DyVec在实验中优于few-shot ICL、LoRA及现有ICV基线。

Conclusion: DyVec为推理时任务适应提供了轻量级且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In-Context derived Vector (ICV) methods extract task-relevant representations
from large language models (LLMs) and reinject them during inference, achieving
comparable performance to few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) without repeated
demonstration processing. However, existing ICV methods remain sensitive to
ICL-specific factors, often use coarse or semantically fragmented
representations as the source of the vector, and rely on heuristic-based
injection positions, limiting their applicability.
  To address these issues, we propose Dynamic Vector (DyVec), which
incorporates an Exhaustive Query Rotation (EQR) strategy to extract robust
semantically aggregated latent representations by mitigating variance
introduced by ICL. It then applies Dynamic Latent Segmentation and Injection to
adaptively partition representations based on task complexity and leverages
REINFORCE-based optimization to learn optimal injection positions for each
segment.
  Experiments results show that DyVec outperforms few-shot ICL, LoRA, and prior
ICV baselines. Further analysis highlights the effectiveness of dynamically
segmenting and injecting semantically aggregated latent representations. DyVec
provides a lightweight and data-efficient solution for inference-time task
adaptation.

### [4] [Less Context, Same Performance: A RAG Framework for Resource-Efficient LLM-Based Clinical NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20320)
*Satya Narayana Cheetirala,Ganesh Raut,Dhavalkumar Patel,Fabio Sanatana,Robert Freeman,Matthew A Levin,Girish N. Nadkarni,Omar Dawkins,Reba Miller,Randolph M. Steinhagen,Eyal Klang,Prem Timsina*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: RAG方法通过检索最相关文本片段，在长文本分类中减少token使用且不损失准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在长文本分类中的token限制和高计算成本问题。

Method: 将临床文档分块并向量化，检索最相关的4000词输入LLM。

Result: RAG方法与全文本处理在AUC ROC等指标上无显著差异。

Conclusion: RAG为长临床文档分析提供了可扩展且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Long text classification is challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) due
to token limits and high computational costs. This study explores whether a
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach using only the most relevant text
segments can match the performance of processing entire clinical notes with
large context LLMs. We begin by splitting clinical documents into smaller
chunks, converting them into vector embeddings, and storing these in a FAISS
index. We then retrieve the top 4,000 words most pertinent to the
classification query and feed these consolidated segments into an LLM. We
evaluated three LLMs (GPT4o, LLaMA, and Mistral) on a surgical complication
identification task. Metrics such as AUC ROC, precision, recall, and F1 showed
no statistically significant differences between the RAG based approach and
whole-text processing (p > 0.05p > 0.05). These findings indicate that RAG can
significantly reduce token usage without sacrificing classification accuracy,
providing a scalable and cost effective solution for analyzing lengthy clinical
documents.

### [5] [BiomedSQL: Text-to-SQL for Scientific Reasoning on Biomedical Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20321)
*Mathew J. Koretsky,Maya Willey,Adi Asija,Owen Bianchi,Chelsea X. Alvarado,Tanay Nayak,Nicole Kuznetsov,Sungwon Kim,Mike A. Nalls,Daniel Khashabi,Faraz Faghri*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: BiomedSQL是一个专门评估生物医学领域文本到SQL转换中科学推理能力的基准，包含68,000个问题/SQL查询/答案三元组，基于真实生物医学知识库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到SQL系统在处理需要隐式领域推理的科学问题时表现不佳，BiomedSQL旨在填补这一空白。

Method: BiomedSQL整合了基因-疾病关联、组学数据因果推断和药物批准记录，要求模型推断领域特定标准而非仅依赖语法翻译。

Result: GPT-o3-mini执行准确率为59.0%，自定义多步代理BMSQL为62.6%，均远低于专家基准90.0%。

Conclusion: BiomedSQL为提升文本到SQL系统的科学推理能力提供了新基础，支持对结构化生物医学知识库的稳健推理。

Abstract: Biomedical researchers increasingly rely on large-scale structured databases
for complex analytical tasks. However, current text-to-SQL systems often
struggle to map qualitative scientific questions into executable SQL,
particularly when implicit domain reasoning is required. We introduce
BiomedSQL, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate scientific
reasoning in text-to-SQL generation over a real-world biomedical knowledge
base. BiomedSQL comprises 68,000 question/SQL query/answer triples grounded in
a harmonized BigQuery knowledge base that integrates gene-disease associations,
causal inference from omics data, and drug approval records. Each question
requires models to infer domain-specific criteria, such as genome-wide
significance thresholds, effect directionality, or trial phase filtering,
rather than rely on syntactic translation alone. We evaluate a range of open-
and closed-source LLMs across prompting strategies and interaction paradigms.
Our results reveal a substantial performance gap: GPT-o3-mini achieves 59.0%
execution accuracy, while our custom multi-step agent, BMSQL, reaches 62.6%,
both well below the expert baseline of 90.0%. BiomedSQL provides a new
foundation for advancing text-to-SQL systems capable of supporting scientific
discovery through robust reasoning over structured biomedical knowledge bases.

### [6] [Beyond Prompt Engineering: Robust Behavior Control in LLMs via Steering Target Atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20322)
*Mengru Wang,Ziwen Xu,Shengyu Mao,Shumin Deng,Zhaopeng Tu,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Steering Target Atoms (STA)的新方法，通过分离和操作知识组件来增强语言模型的安全性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型的内部表示高度交织，限制了控制的精确性并可能导致意外副作用，因此需要更精确的控制方法。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器(SAE)分离高维空间中的知识，并提出STA方法定位和操作原子知识组件。

Result: 实验表明STA方法在安全性和鲁棒性上表现优异，尤其在对抗场景中。该方法还被成功应用于大型推理模型。

Conclusion: STA方法为语言模型的精确控制提供了有效解决方案，尤其在安全和推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Precise control over language model generation is vital for ensuring both
safety and reliability. Although prompt engineering and steering are commonly
used to intervene in model behaviors, the vast number of parameters in models
often results in highly intertwined internal representations. This
interdependency can limit control precision and sometimes lead to unintended
side effects. Recent research has explored the use of sparse autoencoders (SAE)
to disentangle knowledge in high-dimensional spaces for steering. However,
these applications have been limited to toy tasks owing to the nontrivial issue
of locating atomic knowledge components. In this paper, we propose Steering
Target Atoms (STA), a novel method that isolates and manipulates disentangled
knowledge components to enhance safety. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering
exhibits superior robustness and flexibility, particularly in adversarial
scenarios. We also apply the steering strategy to the large reasoning model,
confirming its effectiveness in precise reasoning control.

### [7] [PMOA-TTS: Introducing the PubMed Open Access Textual Times Series Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20323)
*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Sayantan Kumar,George H. Chen,Jeremy C. Weiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: PMOA-TTS是首个公开可用的数据集，包含124,699篇PubMed开放获取案例报告，通过LLM管道转换为结构化（事件、时间）时间线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床叙事中的时间动态建模需要大规模时间标注资源，但现有资源有限。

Method: 结合启发式过滤和Llama 3.3识别单患者案例报告，使用Llama 3.3和DeepSeek R1进行提示驱动提取。

Result: 生成560万条时间戳临床事件，评估显示事件匹配率80%，时间一致性c-index>0.90。

Conclusion: PMOA-TTS为生物医学NLP中的时间线提取和纵向建模提供了可扩展基础。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in clinical narratives is essential for
modeling patient trajectories, yet large-scale temporally annotated resources
remain limited. We present PMOA-TTS, the first openly available dataset of
124,699 PubMed Open Access (PMOA) case reports, each converted into structured
(event, time) timelines via a scalable LLM-based pipeline. Our approach
combines heuristic filtering with Llama 3.3 to identify single-patient case
reports, followed by prompt-driven extraction using Llama 3.3 and DeepSeek R1,
resulting in over 5.6 million timestamped clinical events. To assess timeline
quality, we evaluate against a clinician-curated reference set using three
metrics: (i) event-level matching (80% match at a cosine similarity threshold
of 0.1), (ii) temporal concordance (c-index > 0.90), and (iii) Area Under the
Log-Time CDF (AULTC) for timestamp alignment. Corpus-level analysis shows wide
diagnostic and demographic coverage. In a downstream survival prediction task,
embeddings from extracted timelines achieve time-dependent concordance indices
up to 0.82 $\pm$ 0.01, demonstrating the predictive value of temporally
structured narratives. PMOA-TTS provides a scalable foundation for timeline
extraction, temporal reasoning, and longitudinal modeling in biomedical NLP.

### [8] [Guided by Gut: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Reinforced Intrinsic Confidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20325)
*Amirhosein Ghasemabadi,Keith G. Mills,Baochun Li,Di Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种高效的自我引导测试时间扩展（TTS）框架GG，通过轻量级树搜索和内部信号（如置信度和新颖性）实现高性能，无需依赖昂贵的外部模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS方法依赖外部奖励模型或采样方法，计算成本高，GG旨在通过内部信号实现高效推理。

Method: GG利用轻量级树搜索和内部信号（置信度和新颖性），并通过强化学习微调提高置信度估计的可靠性。

Result: GG使小型模型（1.5B参数）达到或超越大型模型（32B-70B参数）的精度，GPU内存使用减少10倍，推理速度提升8倍。

Conclusion: GG提供了一种高效、低成本的TTS解决方案，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning often incur substantial computational costs, primarily due to
extensive reliance on external Process Reward Models (PRMs) or sampling methods
like Best-of-N (BoN). This paper introduces Guided by Gut (GG), an efficient
self-guided TTS framework that achieves PRM-level performance without costly
external verifier models. Our method employs a lightweight tree search guided
solely by intrinsic LLM signals, token-level confidence and step novelty. One
critical innovation is improving the reliability of internal confidence
estimates via a targeted reinforcement learning fine-tuning phase. Empirical
evaluations on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
GG enables smaller models (e.g., 1.5B parameters) to achieve accuracy matching
or surpassing significantly larger models (e.g., 32B-70B parameters), while
reducing GPU memory usage by up to 10x. Compared to PRM-based methods, GG
achieves comparable accuracy with 8x faster inference speeds and 4-5x lower
memory usage. Additionally, GG reduces KV cache memory usage by approximately
50% compared to the BoN strategy, facilitating more efficient and practical
deployment of TTS techniques.

*Yukun Zhang,Qi Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种多尺度流形对齐框架，通过分解潜在空间为全局、中间和局部语义流形，提升LLM的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM表现优异，但其内部推理不透明，限制了关键应用中的可解释性和信任。

Method: 引入跨尺度映射函数，结合几何对齐和信息保留，并加入曲率正则化和超参数调优。

Result: 理论分析表明对齐误差（KL散度）在温和假设下有界，框架能统一解释LLM的多尺度语义结构。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了LLM的可解释性，支持偏置检测和鲁棒性增强等应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong
performance, yet their internal reasoning remains opaque, limiting
interpretability and trust in critical applications. We propose a novel
Multi_Scale Manifold Alignment framework that decomposes the latent space into
global, intermediate, and local semantic manifolds capturing themes, context,
and word-level details. Our method introduces cross_scale mapping functions
that jointly enforce geometric alignment (e.g., Procrustes analysis) and
information preservation (via mutual information constraints like MINE or VIB).
We further incorporate curvature regularization and hyperparameter tuning for
stable optimization. Theoretical analysis shows that alignment error, measured
by KL divergence, can be bounded under mild assumptions. This framework offers
a unified explanation of how LLMs structure multi-scale semantics, advancing
interpretability and enabling applications such as bias detection and
robustness enhancement.

### [10] [Lookahead Q-Cache: Achieving More Consistent KV Cache Eviction via Pseudo Query](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20334)
*Yixuan Wang,Shiyu Ji,Yijun Liu,Yuzhuang Xu,Yang Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出Lookahead Q-Cache (LAQ)框架，通过生成低成本伪前瞻查询优化KV缓存淘汰，提升长序列解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存内存占用随序列增长而增加，现有淘汰方法因与推理查询不一致导致效率低下。

Method: LAQ生成伪前瞻查询作为重要性估计窗口，实现更一致的KV缓存淘汰。

Result: 在LongBench和Needle-in-a-Haystack基准测试中，LAQ优于现有方法，缓存受限时性能提升1~4点。

Conclusion: LAQ与现有方法互补，可灵活结合以进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value cache (KV cache) to accelerate
decoding by reducing redundant computations. However, the KV cache memory usage
grows substantially with longer text sequences, posing challenges for efficient
deployment. Existing KV cache eviction methods prune tokens using
prefilling-stage attention scores, causing inconsistency with actual inference
queries, especially under tight memory budgets. In this paper, we propose
Lookahead Q-Cache (LAQ), a novel eviction framework that generates low-cost
pseudo lookahead queries to better approximate the true decoding-stage queries.
By using these lookahead queries as the observation window for importance
estimation, LAQ achieves more consistent and accurate KV cache eviction aligned
with real inference scenarios. Experimental results on LongBench and
Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks show that LAQ outperforms existing methods
across various budget levels, achieving a 1 $\sim$ 4 point improvement on
LongBench under limited cache budget. Moreover, LAQ is complementary to
existing approaches and can be flexibly combined to yield further improvements.

### [11] [Language Model Distillation: A Temporal Difference Imitation Learning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20335)
*Zishun Yu,Shangzhe Li,Xinhua Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于时序差分学习的通用框架，用于压缩大型语言模型，通过利用教师模型的分布稀疏性，在缩减的动作空间上操作，以提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能强大，但计算成本高昂。蒸馏技术被广泛用于压缩模型，但现有方法多基于行为克隆。本文从时序差分学习角度提出新框架。

Method: 利用教师模型的分布稀疏性（多数概率集中在少数token上），设计了一个在缩减动作空间上操作的时序差分学习框架。

Result: 展示了如何推导实用算法，并证明了性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为语言模型蒸馏提供了新的通用方法，通过缩减动作空间优化性能。

Abstract: Large language models have led to significant progress across many NLP tasks,
although their massive sizes often incur substantial computational costs.
Distillation has become a common practice to compress these large and highly
capable models into smaller, more efficient ones. Many existing language model
distillation methods can be viewed as behavior cloning from the perspective of
imitation learning or inverse reinforcement learning. This viewpoint has
inspired subsequent studies that leverage (inverse) reinforcement learning
techniques, including variations of behavior cloning and temporal difference
learning methods. Rather than proposing yet another specific temporal
difference method, we introduce a general framework for temporal
difference-based distillation by exploiting the distributional sparsity of the
teacher model. Specifically, it is often observed that language models assign
most probability mass to a small subset of tokens. Motivated by this
observation, we design a temporal difference learning framework that operates
on a reduced action space (a subset of vocabulary), and demonstrate how
practical algorithms can be derived and the resulting performance improvements.

### [12] [MOSLIM:Align with diverse preferences in prompts through reward classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20336)
*Yu Zhang,Wanli Jiang,Zhengyu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: MOSLIM是一种新型多目标对齐方法，通过单一奖励模型和策略模型处理多样化目标，无需偏好训练，显著减少计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型（LLMs）符合多样化人类偏好，当前方法需要多策略或多奖励模型，或偏好特定的监督微调（SFT）模型。

Method: MOSLIM利用多头部奖励模型对问答对分类，并通过映射函数将分类结果转换为奖励分数，优化策略模型。

Result: MOSLIM在多个多目标基准测试中表现优异，且计算资源需求显著低于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOSLIM提供了一种高效、灵活的多目标对齐方法，适用于现成模型，性能优于现有技术。

Abstract: The multi-objective alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential
for ensuring foundational models conform to diverse human preferences. Current
research in this field typically involves either multiple policies or multiple
reward models customized for various preferences, or the need to train a
preference-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model. In this work, we
introduce a novel multi-objective alignment method, MOSLIM, which utilizes a
single reward model and policy model to address diverse objectives. MOSLIM
provides a flexible way to control these objectives through prompting and does
not require preference training during SFT phase, allowing thousands of
off-the-shelf models to be directly utilized within this training framework.
MOSLIM leverages a multi-head reward model that classifies question-answer
pairs instead of scoring them and then optimize policy model with a scalar
reward derived from a mapping function that converts classification results
from reward model into reward scores. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
proposed method across several multi-objective benchmarks and conduct ablation
studies on various reward model sizes and policy optimization methods. The
MOSLIM method outperforms current multi-objective approaches in most results
while requiring significantly fewer GPU computing resources compared with
existing policy optimization methods.

*Cayo Viegas,Rohit Gheyi,Márcio Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在计算机科学领域的能力，特别是POSCOMP考试中的表现。ChatGPT-4在文本题目上表现最佳，但图像解释仍是挑战。新模型进一步超越人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在专业领域（如计算机科学）的实用性，评估其是否能在POSCOMP考试中匹配或超越人类表现。

Method: 评估四种LLMs（ChatGPT-4、Gemini 1.0 Advanced等）在2022-2023年POSCOMP考试中的表现，并扩展分析新模型在2022-2024年考试中的表现。

Result: ChatGPT-4在文本题目上表现最佳，超越人类考生；新模型在所有年份中均超越人类平均和顶尖表现。

Conclusion: LLMs在文本任务上表现优异，尤其在POSCOMP考试中，但图像解释仍需改进。新模型显示出持续进步。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
expanded the capabilities of artificial intelligence in natural language
processing tasks. Despite this progress, their performance in specialized
domains such as computer science remains relatively unexplored. Understanding
the proficiency of LLMs in these domains is critical for evaluating their
practical utility and guiding future developments. The POSCOMP, a prestigious
Brazilian examination used for graduate admissions in computer science promoted
by the Brazlian Computer Society (SBC), provides a challenging benchmark. This
study investigates whether LLMs can match or surpass human performance on the
POSCOMP exam. Four LLMs - ChatGPT-4, Gemini 1.0 Advanced, Claude 3 Sonnet, and
Le Chat Mistral Large - were initially evaluated on the 2022 and 2023 POSCOMP
exams. The assessments measured the models' proficiency in handling complex
questions typical of the exam. LLM performance was notably better on text-based
questions than on image interpretation tasks. In the 2022 exam, ChatGPT-4 led
with 57 correct answers out of 69 questions, followed by Gemini 1.0 Advanced
(49), Le Chat Mistral (48), and Claude 3 Sonnet (44). Similar trends were
observed in the 2023 exam. ChatGPT-4 achieved the highest performance,
surpassing all students who took the POSCOMP 2023 exam. LLMs, particularly
ChatGPT-4, show promise in text-based tasks on the POSCOMP exam, although image
interpretation remains a challenge. Given the rapid evolution of LLMs, we
expanded our analysis to include more recent models - o1, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and o3-mini-high - evaluated on the 2022-2024 POSCOMP exams.
These newer models demonstrate further improvements and consistently surpass
both the average and top-performing human participants across all three years.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: DMET提出了一种动态流形演化理论，将大语言模型生成建模为低维语义流形上的受控动力系统，通过量化指标优化文本生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型生成过程中的动态行为，揭示其内在机制，以提升文本生成的流畅性、语法性和语义连贯性。

Method: 将潜在状态更新建模为连续动力系统的离散时间欧拉近似，利用Lyapunov稳定性理论定义三个量化指标（状态连续性、聚类质量、拓扑持久性）。

Result: 实验验证了DMET的预测，并提供了平衡文本生成创造性和一致性的原则性指导。

Conclusion: DMET为理解语言模型生成动态提供了统一框架，并为优化生成质量提供了量化方法。

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Manifold Evolution Theory (DMET),a unified framework
that models large language model generation as a controlled dynamical system
evolving on a low_dimensional semantic manifold. By casting latent_state
updates as discrete time Euler approximations of continuous dynamics, we map
intrinsic energy_driven flows and context_dependent forces onto Transformer
components (residual connections, attention, feed-forward networks). Leveraging
Lyapunov stability theory We define three empirical metrics (state continuity,
clustering quality, topological persistence) that quantitatively link
latent_trajectory properties to text fluency, grammaticality, and semantic
coherence. Extensive experiments across decoding parameters validate DMET's
predictions and yield principled guidelines for balancing creativity and
consistency in text generation.

Abstract: We investigate the existence and persistence of a specific type of gender
bias in some of the popular LLMs and contribute a new benchmark dataset,
RealWorldQuestioning (released on HuggingFace ), developed from real-world
questions across four key domains in business and health contexts: education,
jobs, personal financial management, and general health. We define and study
entropy bias, which we define as a discrepancy in the amount of information
generated by an LLM in response to real questions users have asked. We tested
this using four different LLMs and evaluated the generated responses both
qualitatively and quantitatively by using ChatGPT-4o (as "LLM-as-judge"). Our
analyses (metric-based comparisons and "LLM-as-judge" evaluation) suggest that
there is no significant bias in LLM responses for men and women at a category
level. However, at a finer granularity (the individual question level), there
are substantial differences in LLM responses for men and women in the majority
of cases, which "cancel" each other out often due to some responses being
better for males and vice versa. This is still a concern since typical users of
these tools often ask a specific question (only) as opposed to several varied
ones in each of these common yet important areas of life. We suggest a simple
debiasing approach that iteratively merges the responses for the two genders to
produce a final result. Our approach demonstrates that a simple, prompt-based
debiasing strategy can effectively debias LLM outputs, thus producing responses
with higher information content than both gendered variants in 78% of the
cases, and consistently achieving a balanced integration in the remaining
cases.

TLDR: SeRL通过自生成指令和自奖励机制，解决了强化学习训练LLMs时高质量指令和可验证奖励的依赖问题。

Motivation: 现有方法依赖高质量指令和可验证奖励，但在专业领域难以获取。

Method: SeRL包含自指令和自奖励模块，前者生成高质量指令，后者通过多数投票机制估计奖励。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，SeRL表现优于现有方法，接近高质量数据训练的效果。

Conclusion: SeRL为有限初始数据下的LLM训练提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, existing works inevitably rely on high-quality instructions and
verifiable rewards for effective training, both of which are often difficult to
obtain in specialized domains. In this paper, we propose Self-play
Reinforcement Learning(SeRL) to bootstrap LLM training with limited initial
data. Specifically, SeRL comprises two complementary modules: self-instruction
and self-rewarding. The former module generates additional instructions based
on the available data at each training step, employing robust online filtering
strategies to ensure instruction quality, diversity, and difficulty. The latter
module introduces a simple yet effective majority-voting mechanism to estimate
response rewards for additional instructions, eliminating the need for external
annotations. Finally, SeRL performs conventional RL based on the generated
data, facilitating iterative self-play learning. Extensive experiments on
various reasoning benchmarks and across different LLM backbones demonstrate
that the proposed SeRL yields results superior to its counterparts and achieves
performance on par with those obtained by high-quality data with verifiable
rewards. Our code is available at https://github.com/wantbook-book/SeRL.

Result: 检索增强方法在蛋白质-文本生成中显著优于微调的大语言模型，且在无训练场景下表现高效准确。

Conclusion: 新方法解决了现有问题，为蛋白质-文本理解提供了更可靠的评估和生成工具。

Abstract: In recent years, protein-text models have gained significant attention for
their potential in protein generation and understanding. Current approaches
focus on integrating protein-related knowledge into large language models
through continued pretraining and multi-modal alignment, enabling simultaneous
comprehension of textual descriptions and protein sequences. Through a thorough
analysis of existing model architectures and text-based protein understanding
benchmarks, we identify significant data leakage issues present in current
benchmarks. Moreover, conventional metrics derived from natural language
processing fail to accurately assess the model's performance in this domain. To
address these limitations, we reorganize existing datasets and introduce a
novel evaluation framework based on biological entities. Motivated by our
observation, we propose a retrieval-enhanced method, which significantly
outperforms fine-tuned LLMs for protein-to-text generation and shows accuracy
and efficiency in training-free scenarios. Our code and data can be seen at

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型（LLMs）在数学和逻辑推理任务中表现良好，但主要依赖记忆而非泛化能力，且缺乏稳健的符号抽象能力。结合符号方法可提升可靠性，但现有方法难以有效利用符号表示。

Method: 通过生成符号推理轨迹，并基于蒙特卡洛估计自动优化的过程奖励模型筛选高质量轨迹，再通过微调方法提升逻辑推理和泛化能力。

Result: 在FOLIO和LogicAsker等逻辑推理基准测试中取得显著提升，且符号推理轨迹的微调增强了模型的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 符号引导的过程监督有助于减轻记忆效应对LLM推理的影响，提升其泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in mathematical
and logical reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to
memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such
performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations,
demonstrating a lack of robust symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning
process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs
with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively
leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing
reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to
overcome such limitations by generating symbolic reasoning trajectories and
select the high-quality ones using a process reward model automatically tuned
based on Monte Carlo estimation. The trajectories are then employed via
fine-tuning methods to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our
results on logical reasoning benchmarks such as FOLIO and LogicAsker show the
effectiveness of the proposed method with large gains on frontier and
open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification
reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories
enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of
symbolically-guided process supervision in alleviating the effect of
memorization on LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调需要大量高质量监督数据，成本高且耗时；现有合成数据方法存在事实错误、覆盖不足等问题。

Method: GraphGen通过构建细粒度知识图谱，识别知识缺口，优先生成高价值、长尾知识的问答对，并采用多跳邻域采样和风格控制生成。

Result: 实验表明，GraphGen在知识密集型任务中优于传统合成数据方法。

Conclusion: GraphGen为监督微调中的数据稀缺问题提供了更可靠和全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs) typically requires substantial
amounts of high-quality supervised data, which is both costly and
labor-intensive to acquire. While synthetic data generation has emerged as a
promising solution, existing approaches frequently suffer from factual
inaccuracies, insufficient long-tail coverage, simplistic knowledge structures,
and homogenized outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphGen, a
knowledge graph-guided framework designed for three key question-answering (QA)
scenarios: atomic QA, aggregated QA, and multi-hop QA. It begins by
constructing a fine-grained knowledge graph from the source text. It then
identifies knowledge gaps in LLMs using the expected calibration error metric,
prioritizing the generation of QA pairs that target high-value, long-tail
knowledge. Furthermore, GraphGen incorporates multi-hop neighborhood sampling
to capture complex relational information and employs style-controlled
generation to diversify the resulting QA data. Experimental results on
knowledge-intensive tasks under closed-book settings demonstrate that GraphGen
outperforms conventional synthetic data methods, offering a more reliable and
comprehensive solution to the data scarcity challenge in supervised
fine-tuning. The code and data are publicly available at

TLDR: SEMMA是一种双模块知识图谱基础模型，通过结合文本语义和结构信息，显著提升了零样本推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱基础模型仅依赖图结构，忽略了文本属性的丰富语义信号，导致在未见关系词汇的泛化场景中表现不佳。

Method: SEMMA利用大型语言模型（LLMs）增强关系标识符，生成语义嵌入，构建文本关系图，并与结构组件融合。

Result: 在54个多样化知识图谱上，SEMMA在完全归纳链接预测中优于纯结构基线（如ULTRA），在未见关系词汇的泛化场景中效果是结构方法的2倍。

Conclusion: 文本语义对于结构方法失效的泛化场景至关重要，基础模型需统一结构和语言信号以提升知识推理能力。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) have shown promise in enabling
zero-shot reasoning over unseen graphs by learning transferable patterns.
However, most existing KGFMs rely solely on graph structure, overlooking the
rich semantic signals encoded in textual attributes. We introduce SEMMA, a
dual-module KGFM that systematically integrates transferable textual semantics
alongside structure. SEMMA leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich
relation identifiers, generating semantic embeddings that subsequently form a
textual relation graph, which is fused with the structural component. Across 54
diverse KGs, SEMMA outperforms purely structural baselines like ULTRA in fully
inductive link prediction. Crucially, we show that in more challenging
generalization settings, where the test-time relation vocabulary is entirely
unseen, structural methods collapse while SEMMA is 2x more effective. Our
findings demonstrate that textual semantics are critical for generalization in
settings where structure alone fails, highlighting the need for foundation
models that unify structural and linguistic signals in knowledge reasoning.

Abstract: This paper introduces PreP-OCR, a two-stage pipeline that combines document
image restoration with semantic-aware post-OCR correction to improve text
extraction from degraded historical documents. Our key innovation lies in
jointly optimizing image clarity and linguistic consistency. First, we generate

image restoration model is trained on this synthetic data, using
multi-directional patch extraction and fusion to process large images. Second,
a ByT5 post-corrector, fine-tuned on synthetic historical text training pairs,
addresses any remaining OCR errors. Detailed experiments on 13,831 pages of
real historical documents in English, French, and Spanish show that PreP-OCR
pipeline reduces character error rates by 63.9-70.3\% compared to OCR on raw
images. Our pipeline demonstrates the potential of integrating image

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: HAMburger是一种分层自回归模型，通过优化KV缓存和计算分配，显著提升LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理中，每个token需要一次前向传递和KV缓存，效率低下。研究发现LLM能自我识别KV缓存的信息量，无需全局上下文即可生成部分token。

Method: 引入HAMburger模型，结合分层嵌入器和微步解码器，将多个token压缩到一个KV缓存中，并支持推测解码。

Result: KV缓存计算减少2倍，吞吐量提升2倍，同时保持任务质量。

Conclusion: HAMburger在计算和内存效率上实现突破，为LLM推理提供硬件无关的优化方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference
requires a holistic optimization on algorithms, systems, and hardware. However,
very few works have fundamentally changed the generation pattern: each token
needs one forward pass and one KV cache. This can be sub-optimal because we
found that LLMs are extremely capable of self-identifying the exact dose of
information that a single KV cache can store, and many tokens can be generated
confidently without global context. Based on this insight, we introduce
HAMburger, a Hierarchically Auto-regressive Model that redefines resource
allocation in LLMs by moving beyond uniform computation and storage per token
during inference. Stacking a compositional embedder and a micro-step decoder in
between a base LLM, HAMburger smashes multiple tokens into a single KV and
generates several tokens per step. Additionally, HAMburger functions as a
speculative decoding framework where it can blindly trust self-drafted tokens.
As a result, HAMburger shifts the growth of KV cache and forward FLOPs from
linear to sub-linear with respect to output length, and adjusts its inference
speed based on query perplexity and output structure. Extensive evaluations
show that HAMburger reduces the KV cache computation by up to 2$\times$ and
achieves up to 2$\times$ TPS, while maintaining quality in both short- and
long-context tasks. Our method explores an extremely challenging inference
regime that requires both computation- and memory-efficiency with a
hardware-agnostic design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球有约7000种语言，但现有大语言模型（LLMs）仅支持少数。研究探索LLMs是否能在无监督数据情况下学习新语言，尤其是语音识别任务。

Method: 在四种未见过的濒危语言上实验，通过提供更多相关文本样本，比较基于概率和基于指令的方法。

Result: 基于概率的方法表现更优，ICL使LLMs在语音识别任务中表现接近或超越专用语言模型。

Conclusion: ICL是LLMs学习低资源语言的有效方法，且能保留其原有能力。

Abstract: With approximately 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, current large language
models (LLMs) support only a small subset. Prior research indicates LLMs can
learn new languages for certain tasks without supervised data. We extend this
investigation to speech recognition, investigating whether LLMs can learn
unseen, low-resource languages through in-context learning (ICL). With
experiments on four diverse endangered languages that LLMs have not been
trained on, we find that providing more relevant text samples enhances
performance in both language modelling and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
tasks. Furthermore, we show that the probability-based approach outperforms the
traditional instruction-based approach in language learning. Lastly, we show
ICL enables LLMs to achieve ASR performance that is comparable to or even
surpasses dedicated language models trained specifically for these languages,
while preserving the original capabilities of the LLMs.

Motivation: 现有LLM评委在评估多轮对话时缺乏对对话结构和意图变化的考虑，需改进其准确性。

Method: Amulet结合对话行为和准则分析对话结构和意图变化，用于评估偏好数据。

Result: 实验显示人类意图在多轮对话中频繁变化（60-70%），75%的偏好响应可通过对话行为或准则区分。

Conclusion: Amulet显著提升LLM评委在多轮对话评估中的表现，可作为独立评委或集成到评委组中。

Abstract: Today, large language models are widely used as judges to evaluate responses
from other language models. Hence, it is imperative to benchmark and improve
these LLM-judges on real-world language model usage: a typical human-assistant
conversation is lengthy, and shows significant diversity in topics, intents,
and requirements across turns, e.g. social interactions, task requests,
feedback. We present Amulet, a framework that leverages pertinent linguistic
concepts of dialog-acts and maxims to improve the accuracy of LLM-judges on
preference data with complex, multi-turn conversational context. Amulet
presents valuable insights about (a) the communicative structures and intents
present in the conversation (dialog acts), and (b) the satisfaction of
conversational principles (maxims) by the preference responses, and uses them
to make judgments. On four challenging datasets, Amulet shows that (a) humans
frequently (60 to 70 percent of the time) change their intents from one turn of
the conversation to the next, and (b) in 75 percent of instances, the
preference responses can be differentiated via dialog acts and/or maxims,
reiterating the latter's significance in judging such data. Amulet can be used
either as a judge by applying the framework to a single LLM, or integrated into
a jury with different LLM judges; our judges and juries show strong
improvements on relevant baselines for all four datasets.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种通用机制（Conversation Kernels）来分析在线对话中的上下文依赖关系，以理解帖子的不同属性（如信息性、趣味性等）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交网络和在线讨论论坛的发展，理解在线对话的需求增加，但由于帖子简短且隐含上下文依赖，传统方法难以有效分析。

Method: 设计了两种Conversation Kernels，通过探索对话树中帖子的不同邻域来构建适合特定任务的上下文。

Result: 方法在slashdot.org的数据上进行了测试，验证了其通用性和灵活性。

Conclusion: Conversation Kernels是一种通用且灵活的框架，适用于多种对话理解任务。

Abstract: Understanding online conversations has attracted research attention with the
growth of social networks and online discussion forums. Content analysis of
posts and replies in online conversations is difficult because each individual
utterance is usually short and may implicitly refer to other posts within the
same conversation. Thus, understanding individual posts requires capturing the
conversational context and dependencies between different parts of a
conversation tree and then encoding the context dependencies between posts and
comments/replies into the language model.
  To this end, we propose a general-purpose mechanism to discover appropriate
conversational context for various aspects about an online post in a
conversation, such as whether it is informative, insightful, interesting or
funny. Specifically, we design two families of Conversation Kernels, which
explore different parts of the neighborhood of a post in the tree representing
the conversation and through this, build relevant conversational context that
is appropriate for each task being considered. We apply our developed method to
conversations crawled from slashdot.org, which allows users to apply highly
different labels to posts, such as 'insightful', 'funny', etc., and therefore
provides an ideal experimental platform to study whether a framework such as
Conversation Kernels is general-purpose and flexible enough to be adapted to
disparately different conversation understanding tasks.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种信息对齐机制，旨在提升生成文本的事实完整性和信息量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs生成的文本可能事实正确，但往往信息量不足。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用现有的事实基准，提出信息对齐目标，优先选择既正确又信息丰富的答案。

Result: 通过优化这一目标，不仅能提升信息量，还能改善事实准确性。

Conclusion: 信息对齐机制是提升LLMs生成文本质量和事实性的有效方法。

Abstract: Factual completeness is a general term that captures how detailed and
informative a factually correct text is. For instance, the factual sentence
``Barack Obama was born in the United States'' is factually correct, though
less informative than the factual sentence ``Barack Obama was born in Honolulu,
Hawaii, United States''. Despite the known fact that LLMs tend to hallucinate
and generate factually incorrect text, they might also tend to choose to
generate factual text that is indeed factually correct and yet less informative
than other, more informative choices. In this work, we tackle this problem by
proposing an informativeness alignment mechanism. This mechanism takes
advantage of recent factual benchmarks to propose an informativeness alignment
objective. This objective prioritizes answers that are both correct and
informative. A key finding of our work is that when training a model to
maximize this objective or optimize its preference, we can improve not just
informativeness but also factuality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer将所有token信息压缩到单个[CLS] token中，可能导致局部或层次化信息丢失，影响任务表现。

Method: 引入多尺度特征提取模块，动态加权token以平衡局部和全局依赖。

Result: 在情感识别、反讽检测、疾病识别和疫苗推文分类等任务中，性能提升1%至14%。

Conclusion: 该方法具有跨语言和多领域的适用性，能有效丰富Transformer的表示能力。

Abstract: Conventional transformer models typically compress the information from all
tokens in a sequence into a single \texttt{[CLS]} token to represent global
context-- an approach that can lead to information loss in tasks requiring
localized or hierarchical cues. In this work, we introduce \textit{Inceptive
Transformer}, a modular and lightweight architecture that enriches
transformer-based token representations by integrating a multi-scale feature
extraction module inspired by inception networks. Our model is designed to
balance local and global dependencies by dynamically weighting tokens based on
their relevance to a particular task. Evaluation across a diverse range of
tasks including emotion recognition (both English and Bangla), irony detection,
disease identification, and anti-COVID vaccine tweets classification shows that
our models consistently outperform the baselines by 1\% to 14\% while
maintaining efficiency. These findings highlight the versatility and
cross-lingual applicability of our method for enriching transformer-based
representations across diverse domains.

Result: LLMs能识别相关术语但常忽略有害含义，依赖关键词匹配；人类则考虑更多上下文因素。

Conclusion: LLMs在识别歧视性内容时存在局限性，但二元分类法适用于评估其表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making tasks
like r\'esum\'e screening and content moderation, giving them the power to
amplify or suppress certain perspectives. While previous research has
identified disability-related biases in LLMs, little is known about how they
conceptualize ableism or detect it in text. We evaluate the ability of four
LLMs to identify nuanced ableism directed at autistic individuals. We examine
the gap between their understanding of relevant terminology and their
effectiveness in recognizing ableist content in context. Our results reveal
that LLMs can identify autism-related language but often miss harmful or
offensive connotations. Further, we conduct a qualitative comparison of human
and LLM explanations. We find that LLMs tend to rely on surface-level keyword
matching, leading to context misinterpretations, in contrast to human
annotators who consider context, speaker identity, and potential impact. On the
other hand, both LLMs and humans agree on the annotation scheme, suggesting
that a binary classification is adequate for evaluating LLM performance, which
is consistent with findings from prior studies involving human annotators.

Method: 采用多种技术，从同义词替换到生成模型结合光束搜索和命名实体分析。

Result: 排除最多3.6%的常见字母对文本意义影响较小，但随着约束加强，翻译保真度迅速下降。

Conclusion: 英语在严格约束下表现出惊人的灵活性，语言具有高度的适应性和创造力。

Abstract: Lipograms are a unique form of constrained writing where all occurrences of a
particular letter are excluded from the text, typified by the novel Gadsby,
which daringly avoids all usage of the letter 'e'. In this study, we explore
the power of modern large language models (LLMs) by transforming the novel F.
Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby into a fully 'e'-less text. We experimented
with a range of techniques, from baseline methods like synonym replacement to
sophisticated generative models enhanced with beam search and named entity
analysis. We show that excluding up to 3.6% of the most common letters (up to
the letter 'u') had minimal impact on the text's meaning, although translation
fidelity rapidly and predictably decays with stronger lipogram constraints. Our
work highlights the surprising flexibility of English under strict constraints,
revealing just how adaptable and creative language can be.

*Md Mahadi Hassan,John Salvador,Akond Rahman,Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: ITAB基准测试评估开源LLMs在生成功能性Ansible脚本方面的表现，发现其在状态推理和领域知识上存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在IT自动化任务（如Ansible）中的实际表现，填补现有基准测试的不足。

Method: 提出ITAB基准测试，包含126个多样化任务，通过动态执行评估14个开源LLMs。

Result: LLMs的通过率低于12%，主要错误为状态推理（44.87%）和模块知识不足（24.37%）。

Conclusion: 可靠IT自动化需在状态推理和领域知识上取得重大进展。

Abstract: LLMs show promise in code generation, yet their effectiveness for IT
automation tasks, particularly for tools like Ansible, remains understudied.
Existing benchmarks rely primarily on synthetic tasks that fail to capture the
needs of practitioners who use IT automation tools, such as Ansible. We present
ITAB (IT Automation Task Benchmark), a benchmark of 126 diverse tasks (e.g.,
configuring servers, managing files) where each task accounts for state
reconciliation: a property unique to IT automation tools. ITAB evaluates LLMs'
ability to generate functional Ansible automation scripts via dynamic execution
in controlled environments. We evaluate 14 open-source LLMs, none of which
accomplish pass@10 at a rate beyond 12%. To explain these low scores, we
analyze 1,411 execution failures across the evaluated LLMs and identify two
main categories of prevalent semantic errors: failures in state reconciliation
related reasoning (44.87% combined from variable (11.43%), host (11.84%),
path(11.63%), and template (9.97%) issues) and deficiencies in module-specific
execution knowledge (24.37% combined from Attribute and parameter (14.44%) and
module (9.93%) errors). Our findings reveal key limitations in open-source
LLMs' ability to track state changes and apply specialized module knowledge,
indicating that reliable IT automation will require major advances in state
reasoning and domain-specific execution understanding.

TLDR: 本文综述了多模态对话情感识别（MERC）的研究现状，包括其动机、核心任务、代表性方法、评估策略及未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升人机交互的自然性和情感理解，需要超越单一模态的多模态情感识别。

Method: 整合文本、语音和视觉信号等多模态信息进行情感识别。

Result: 系统总结了MERC的研究进展、挑战和趋势。

Conclusion: MERC是提升情感智能系统的关键方向，本文为未来研究提供了指导。

Abstract: While text-based emotion recognition methods have achieved notable success,
real-world dialogue systems often demand a more nuanced emotional understanding
than any single modality can offer. Multimodal Emotion Recognition in
Conversations (MERC) has thus emerged as a crucial direction for enhancing the
naturalness and emotional understanding of human-computer interaction. Its goal
is to accurately recognize emotions by integrating information from various
modalities such as text, speech, and visual signals.
  This survey offers a systematic overview of MERC, including its motivations,
core tasks, representative methods, and evaluation strategies. We further
examine recent trends, highlight key challenges, and outline future directions.
As interest in emotionally intelligent systems grows, this survey provides
timely guidance for advancing MERC research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在科学工作流中生成正确科学洞察的能力，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出AstroVisBench，结合科学计算和可视化任务，并采用LLM-as-a-judge方法验证结果。

Result: 评估显示当前先进语言模型在天文学研究中的辅助能力存在显著差距。

Conclusion: AstroVisBench为AI科学家提供了端到端评估工具，推动了可视化工作流的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being explored for applications in
scientific research, including their capabilities to synthesize literature,
answer research questions, generate research ideas, and even conduct
computational experiments. Ultimately, our goal is for these to help scientists
derive novel scientific insights. In many areas of science, such insights often
arise from processing and visualizing data to understand its patterns. However,
evaluating whether an LLM-mediated scientific workflow produces outputs
conveying the correct scientific insights is challenging to evaluate and has
not been addressed in past work. We introduce AstroVisBench, the first
benchmark for both scientific computing and visualization in the astronomy
domain. AstroVisBench judges a language model's ability to both (1) create
astronomy-specific workflows to process and analyze data and (2) visualize the
results of these workflows through complex plots. Our evaluation of
visualizations uses a novel LLM-as-a-judge workflow, which is validated against
annotation by five professional astronomers. Using AstroVisBench we present an
evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, showing a significant gap in
their ability to engage in astronomy research as useful assistants. This
evaluation provides a strong end-to-end evaluation for AI scientists that
offers a path forward for the development of visualization-based workflows,
which are central to a broad range of domains from physics to biology.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 多语言大语言模型（LLMs）在事实召回任务中表现不一致，英语优于其他语言。研究发现其机制为英语中心的事实召回和翻译回目标语言，导致错误。通过向量干预，提高了最低表现语言的召回准确率35%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言LLMs在非英语语言中事实召回表现较差，原因不明。研究旨在揭示其机制并提出改进方法。

Method: 使用机制分析技术，识别LLMs的英语中心召回和翻译机制，提出两种语言无关的向量干预方法。

Result: 干预方法显著提高了最低表现语言的召回准确率，增幅超过35%。

Conclusion: 机制分析可揭示LLMs的多语言潜力，向量干预能有效提升事实一致性。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often exhibit factual
inconsistencies across languages, with significantly better performance in
factual recall tasks in English than in other languages. The causes of these
failures, however, remain poorly understood. Using mechanistic analysis
techniques, we uncover the underlying pipeline that LLMs employ, which involves
using the English-centric factual recall mechanism to process multilingual
queries and then translating English answers back into the target language. We
identify two primary sources of error: insufficient engagement of the reliable
English-centric mechanism for factual recall, and incorrect translation from
English back into the target language for the final answer. To address these
vulnerabilities, we introduce two vector interventions, both independent of
languages and datasets, to redirect the model toward better internal paths for
higher factual consistency. Our interventions combined increase the recall
accuracy by over 35 percent for the lowest-performing language. Our findings
demonstrate how mechanistic insights can be used to unlock latent multilingual
capabilities in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: NaijaVoices数据集填补了非洲语言（伊博语、豪萨语、约鲁巴语）语音数据的空白，包含1800小时语音文本数据，显著提升了语音识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲语言在语音技术中代表性不足，现有数据集规模小且多样性不足，限制了语音技术的普及。

Method: 通过独特的数据收集方法构建了NaijaVoices数据集，包含5000+说话者的1800小时语音文本数据。

Result: 在自动语音识别实验中，Whisper、MMS和XLSR的WER分别平均提升了75.86%、52.06%和42.33%。

Conclusion: NaijaVoices数据集为非洲语言的语音处理提供了重要资源，推动了多语言技术的发展。

Abstract: The development of high-performing, robust, and reliable speech technologies
depends on large, high-quality datasets. However, African languages --
including our focus, Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba -- remain under-represented due to
insufficient data. Popular voice-enabled technologies do not support any of the
2000+ African languages, limiting accessibility for circa one billion people.
While previous dataset efforts exist for the target languages, they lack the
scale and diversity needed for robust speech models. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the NaijaVoices dataset, a 1,800-hour speech-text dataset with 5,000+
speakers. We outline our unique data collection approach, analyze its acoustic
diversity, and demonstrate its impact through finetuning experiments on
automatic speech recognition, averagely achieving 75.86% (Whisper), 52.06%
(MMS), and 42.33% (XLSR) WER improvements. These results highlight NaijaVoices'
potential to advance multilingual speech processing for African languages.

*Bipul Thapa,Gabriel Cofre*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文提出了一种结合TF-IDF和BERT嵌入的混合方法，用于将西班牙语客户反馈分类为积极、中性和消极情感，并通过自定义堆叠集成（CSE）模型显著提高了分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将广泛使用的语言翻译为较少使用的语言会导致语义完整性和上下文细微差别的丢失，因此需要一种能保留原始语言语义深度的分类方法。

Method: 采用TF-IDF与BERT嵌入结合的混合方法，并使用CSE模型（基础模型包括逻辑回归、KNN、LGBM和AdaBoost，元模型为一对多逻辑回归）进行分类。

Result: CSE模型在西班牙语数据集上的测试准确率达到93.3%，显著优于单独模型和BERT模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合TF-IDF和BERT嵌入的方法能有效提升西班牙语情感分类的准确性，为企业改进客户反馈分析提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Classifying customer feedback into distinct emotion categories is essential
for understanding sentiment and improving customer experience. In this paper,
we classify customer feedback in Spanish into three emotion
categories--positive, neutral, and negative--using advanced NLP and ML
techniques. Traditional methods translate feedback from widely spoken languages
to less common ones, resulting in a loss of semantic integrity and contextual
nuances inherent to the original language. To address this limitation, we
propose a hybrid approach that combines TF-IDF with BERT embeddings,
effectively transforming Spanish text into rich numerical representations that
preserve the semantic depth of the original language by using a Custom Stacking
Ensemble (CSE) approach. To evaluate emotion classification, we utilize a range
of models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Bagging classifier with LGBM,
and AdaBoost. The CSE model combines these classifiers as base models and uses
a one-vs-all Logistic Regression as the meta-model. Our experimental results
demonstrate that CSE significantly outperforms the individual and BERT model,
achieving a test accuracy of 93.3% on the native Spanish dataset--higher than
the accuracy obtained from the translated version. These findings underscore
the challenges of emotion classification in Spanish and highlight the
advantages of combining vectorization techniques like TF-IDF with BERT for
improved accuracy. Our results provide valuable insights for businesses seeking
to leverage emotion classification to enhance customer feedback analysis and
service improvements.

*Sairam Gurajada,Eser Kandogan,Sajjadur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文提出了一种针对生产场景的高精度、高性能NL2SQL系统，通过静态示例集和多目标优化框架解决上下文选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NL2SQL方法主要关注高质量的SQL生成，但生产场景需要高精度和高性能的系统。静态示例集的选择比基于相似性的选择更关键。

Method: 提出一个提示优化框架，通过多目标优化选择静态示例集，优化SQL生成性能和精度。

Result: 初步实验证明了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 静态示例集和多目标优化框架能显著提升生产场景中NL2SQL系统的性能和精度。

Abstract: NL2SQL approaches have greatly benefited from the impressive capabilities of
large language models (LLMs). In particular, bootstrapping an NL2SQL system for
a specific domain can be as simple as instructing an LLM with sufficient
contextual information, such as schema details and translation demonstrations.
However, building an accurate system still requires the rigorous task of
selecting the right context for each query-including identifying relevant
schema elements, cell values, and suitable exemplars that help the LLM
understand domain-specific nuances. Retrieval-based methods have become the
go-to approach for identifying such context. While effective, these methods
introduce additional inference-time costs due to the retrieval process.
  In this paper, we argue that production scenarios demand high-precision,
high-performance NL2SQL systems, rather than simply high-quality SQL
generation, which is the focus of most current NL2SQL approaches. In such
scenarios, the careful selection of a static set of exemplars-capturing the
intricacies of the query log, target database, SQL constructs, and execution
latencies-plays a more crucial role than exemplar selection based solely on
similarity. The key challenge, however, lies in identifying a representative
set of exemplars for a given production setting. To this end, we propose a
prompt optimization framework that not only addresses the high-precision
requirement but also optimizes the performance of the generated SQL through
multi-objective optimization. Preliminary empirical analysis demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TLDR: 研究发现，ASR模型的泛化能力主要受声学多样性而非语言丰富性驱动，针对性声学增强方法可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索训练数据中语言和声学多样性对ASR模型鲁棒性的影响，以解决大规模数据集不切实际的问题。

Method: 通过分析声学增强方法对模型泛化能力的影响，使用960小时Librispeech数据集进行实验。

Result: 声学增强方法将未见数据集的词错误率降低达19.24%。

Conclusion: 声学聚焦的数据增强是构建鲁棒ASR模型的有效替代方案，尤其适用于缺乏大规模语音数据的情况。

Abstract: Whisper's robust performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR) is often
attributed to its massive 680k-hour training set, an impractical scale for most
researchers. In this work, we examine how linguistic and acoustic diversity in
training data affect the robustness of the ASR model and reveal that
transcription generalization is primarily driven by acoustic variation rather
than linguistic richness. We find that targeted acoustic augmentation methods
could significantly improve the generalization ability of ASR models, reducing
word-error rates by up to 19.24 percent on unseen datasets when training on the
960-hour Librispeech dataset. These findings highlight strategic acoustically
focused data augmentation as a promising alternative to massive datasets for
building robust ASR models, offering a potential solution to future foundation
ASR models when massive human speech data is lacking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定理证明器在高中和竞赛数学中表现优异，但在高等数学中泛化能力不足。

Method: 开发了REAL-Prover-v1模型、HERALD-AF数据提取管道和Jixia-interactive环境，结合Leansearch-PS检索系统。

Result: 在ProofNet数据集上达到23.7%的成功率（Pass@64），在FATE-M基准上达到56.7%的SOTA成功率。

Conclusion: REAL-Prover在高等数学问题解决上具有竞争力，为定理证明领域提供了新工具。

Abstract: Nowadays, formal theorem provers have made monumental progress on high-school
and competition-level mathematics, but few of them generalize to more advanced
mathematics. In this paper, we present REAL-Prover, a new open-source stepwise
theorem prover for Lean 4 to push this boundary. This prover, based on our
fine-tuned large language model (REAL-Prover-v1) and integrated with a
retrieval system (Leansearch-PS), notably boosts performance on solving
college-level mathematics problems. To train REAL-Prover-v1, we developed
HERALD-AF, a data extraction pipeline that converts natural language math
problems into formal statements, and a new open-source Lean 4 interactive
environment (Jixia-interactive) to facilitate synthesis data collection. In our
experiments, our prover using only supervised fine-tune achieves competitive
results with a 23.7% success rate (Pass@64) on the ProofNet dataset-comparable
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To further evaluate our approach, we
introduce FATE-M, a new benchmark focused on algebraic problems, where our
prover achieves a SOTA success rate of 56.7% (Pass@64).

TLDR: SeqPO-SiMT是一种新的策略优化框架，将同步机器翻译任务视为顺序决策问题，通过定制奖励提升翻译质量并降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如PPO和DPO）主要针对单步任务，而SeqPO-SiMT旨在解决多步同步机器翻译任务。

Method: SeqPO-SiMT通过定制奖励模拟和优化同步翻译过程，实验在六个数据集上进行。

Result: SeqPO-SiMT在翻译质量和延迟上表现优异，COMET分数提升1.13，平均延迟降低6.17。

Conclusion: SeqPO-SiMT在7B LLM上的表现甚至媲美离线翻译的高性能模型。

Abstract: We present Sequential Policy Optimization for Simultaneous Machine
Translation (SeqPO-SiMT), a new policy optimization framework that defines the
simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) task as a sequential decision making
problem, incorporating a tailored reward to enhance translation quality while
reducing latency. In contrast to popular Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) methods, such as PPO and DPO, which are typically applied in
single-step tasks, SeqPO-SiMT effectively tackles the multi-step SiMT task.
This intuitive framework allows the SiMT LLMs to simulate and refine the SiMT
process using a tailored reward. We conduct experiments on six datasets from
diverse domains for En to Zh and Zh to En SiMT tasks, demonstrating that
SeqPO-SiMT consistently achieves significantly higher translation quality with
lower latency. In particular, SeqPO-SiMT outperforms the supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) model by 1.13 points in COMET, while reducing the Average Lagging by 6.17
in the NEWSTEST2021 En to Zh dataset. While SiMT operates with far less context
than offline translation, the SiMT results of SeqPO-SiMT on 7B LLM surprisingly
rival the offline translation of high-performing LLMs, including
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct.

TLDR: POLAR是一个多语言、多文化、多事件的数据集，用于研究在线极化现象，并通过实验评估了多种语言模型在极化检测中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线极化对民主话语构成挑战，但现有研究多为单语言或特定事件，缺乏广泛性和多样性。

Method: 构建POLAR数据集，标注极化的三个维度（存在、类型、表现），并在多语言和跨语言设置下微调模型，评估LLMs的表现。

Result: 模型在二元极化检测中表现良好，但在预测极化类型和表现时得分较低。

Conclusion: 极化具有高度情境性，需开发更稳健的NLP方法，POLAR数据集将公开以支持全球研究。

Abstract: Online polarization poses a growing challenge for democratic discourse, yet
most computational social science research remains monolingual, culturally
narrow, or event-specific. We introduce POLAR, a multilingual, multicultural,
and multievent dataset with over 23k instances in seven languages from diverse
online platforms and real-world events. Polarization is annotated along three
axes: presence, type, and manifestation, using a variety of annotation
platforms adapted to each cultural context. We conduct two main experiments:
(1) we fine-tune six multilingual pretrained language models in both
monolingual and cross-lingual setups; and (2) we evaluate a range of open and
closed large language models (LLMs) in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.
Results show that while most models perform well on binary polarization
detection, they achieve substantially lower scores when predicting polarization
types and manifestations. These findings highlight the complex, highly
contextual nature of polarization and the need for robust, adaptable approaches
in NLP and computational social science. All resources will be released to
support further research and effective mitigation of digital polarization
globally.

Result: 在1k至1M长度的基准测试中，XpandA实现了20%的性能提升和1.5倍推理加速。

Conclusion: XpandA为LLMs的长上下文处理提供了高效且可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Processing long contexts has become a critical capability for modern large
language models (LLMs). Existing works leverage agent-based divide-and-conquer
methods for processing long contexts. But these methods face crucial
limitations, including prohibitive accumulated latency and amplified
information loss from excessive agent invocations, and the disruption of
inherent textual dependencies by immoderate partitioning. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-agent framework XpandA (Expand-Agent) coupled with
question-driven workflow and dynamic partitioning for robust long-context
processing. XpandA overcomes these limitations through: 1) dynamic partitioning
of long texts, which adaptively modulates the filling rate of context windows
for input sequences of vastly varying lengths; 2) question-guided protocol to
update flat information ensembles within centralized shared memory,
constructing consistent inter-agent knowledge across partitions; and 3)
selectively replaying specific partitions based on the state-tracking of
question-information couples to promote the resolution of inverted-order
structures across partitions (e.g., flashbacks). We perform a comprehensive
evaluation of XpandA on multiple long-context benchmarks with length varying
from 1k to 1M, demonstrating XpandA's feasibility for processing ultra-long
sequences and its significant effectiveness in enhancing the long-context
capabilities of various LLMs by achieving 20\% improvements and 1.5x inference
speedup over baselines of full-context, RAG and previous agent-based methods.

Motivation: LLMs在泛化到专业领域和处理语言变体时存在局限性，需要动态适应方法。

Method: 采用输入困惑度最小化的自监督方法，结合高效样本学习策略和低秩适应（LoRA）技术。

Result: TLM在领域知识适应上比原始LLMs性能提升至少20%。

Conclusion: TLM通过测试时学习有效提升LLMs在专业领域的适应性，同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable emergent
capabilities through extensive pre-training, they still face critical
limitations in generalizing to specialized domains and handling diverse
linguistic variations, known as distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose
a Test-Time Learning (TTL) paradigm for LLMs, namely TLM, which dynamically
adapts LLMs to target domains using only unlabeled test data during testing.
Specifically, we first provide empirical evidence and theoretical insights to
reveal that more accurate predictions from LLMs can be achieved by minimizing
the input perplexity of the unlabeled test data. Based on this insight, we
formulate the Test-Time Learning process of LLMs as input perplexity
minimization, enabling self-supervised enhancement of LLM performance.
Furthermore, we observe that high-perplexity samples tend to be more
informative for model optimization. Accordingly, we introduce a Sample
Efficient Learning Strategy that actively selects and emphasizes these
high-perplexity samples for test-time updates. Lastly, to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting and ensure adaptation stability, we adopt Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
instead of full-parameter optimization, which allows lightweight model updates
while preserving more original knowledge from the model. We introduce the
AdaptEval benchmark for TTL and demonstrate through experiments that TLM
improves performance by at least 20% compared to original LLMs on domain
knowledge adaptation.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在适应多样化社区规范、观点和沟通风格方面的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入Steer-Bench基准测试，包含30对对比子Reddit社区、10,000+指令-响应对和5,500多选问题，测试LLMs的社区对齐能力。

Result: 人类专家准确率达81%，而最佳LLMs仅达65%，部分模型差距超过15个百分点。

Conclusion: Steer-Bench揭示了LLMs在社区敏感性方面的不足，为未来研究提供了系统评估工具。

Abstract: Steerability, or the ability of large language models (LLMs) to adapt outputs
to align with diverse community-specific norms, perspectives, and communication
styles, is critical for real-world applications but remains under-evaluated. We
introduce Steer-Bench, a benchmark for assessing population-specific steering
using contrasting Reddit communities. Covering 30 contrasting subreddit pairs
across 19 domains, Steer-Bench includes over 10,000 instruction-response pairs
and validated 5,500 multiple-choice question with corresponding silver labels
to test alignment with diverse community norms. Our evaluation of 13 popular
LLMs using Steer-Bench reveals that while human experts achieve an accuracy of
81% with silver labels, the best-performing models reach only around 65%
accuracy depending on the domain and configuration. Some models lag behind
human-level alignment by over 15 percentage points, highlighting significant
gaps in community-sensitive steerability. Steer-Bench is a benchmark to
systematically assess how effectively LLMs understand community-specific
instructions, their resilience to adversarial steering attempts, and their
ability to accurately represent diverse cultural and ideological perspectives.

*Yan Wang,Yang Ren,Lingfei Qian,Xueqing Peng,Keyi Wang,Yi Han,Dongji Feng,Xiao-Yang Liu,Jimin Huang,Qianqian Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: FinTagging是首个全面、表格感知的XBRL基准，用于评估大语言模型在XBRL财务报告中的结构化信息提取和语义对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准简化了XBRL标记问题，仅关注叙述性文本，而FinTagging将其分解为两个子任务，以更真实地评估模型能力。

Method: FinTagging将XBRL标记分解为FinNI（金融实体提取）和FinCL（分类驱动的概念对齐），并评估多种大语言模型的零样本性能。

Result: 大语言模型在信息提取方面表现良好，但在细粒度概念对齐上表现不佳，特别是在区分相近分类条目时。

Conclusion: 现有大语言模型在完全自动化XBRL标记方面存在局限，需改进语义推理和模式感知建模以提高财务披露准确性。

Abstract: We introduce FinTagging, the first full-scope, table-aware XBRL benchmark
designed to evaluate the structured information extraction and semantic
alignment capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the context of
XBRL-based financial reporting. Unlike prior benchmarks that oversimplify XBRL
tagging as flat multi-class classification and focus solely on narrative text,
FinTagging decomposes the XBRL tagging problem into two subtasks: FinNI for
financial entity extraction and FinCL for taxonomy-driven concept alignment. It
requires models to jointly extract facts and align them with the full 10k+
US-GAAP taxonomy across both unstructured text and structured tables, enabling
realistic, fine-grained evaluation. We assess a diverse set of LLMs under
zero-shot settings, systematically analyzing their performance on both subtasks
and overall tagging accuracy. Our results reveal that, while LLMs demonstrate
strong generalization in information extraction, they struggle with
fine-grained concept alignment, particularly in disambiguating closely related
taxonomy entries. These findings highlight the limitations of existing LLMs in
fully automating XBRL tagging and underscore the need for improved semantic
reasoning and schema-aware modeling to meet the demands of accurate financial
disclosure. Code is available at our GitHub repository and data is at our
Hugging Face repository.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种基于事件的新型标注方法，构建了首个中文网络欺凌事件检测数据集CHNCI，包含91个事件中的220,676条评论。通过结合三种基于解释生成的检测方法生成伪标签，并由人工标注验证，实验证明该数据集可作为网络欺凌检测和事件预测的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络欺凌检测基准通常基于言论极性（如'攻击性'和'非攻击性'），本质上是仇恨言论检测，而现实中网络欺凌往往通过事件引发广泛社会关注。

Method: 提出一种新型标注方法，结合三种基于解释生成的网络欺凌检测方法生成伪标签，并由人工标注验证，同时提出评估标准判断是否构成网络欺凌事件。

Result: 构建的CHNCI数据集包含91个事件中的220,676条评论，实验证明其可作为网络欺凌检测和事件预测的基准。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对中文网络欺凌事件检测任务的研究，CHNCI数据集为相关任务提供了基准。

Abstract: Existing cyberbullying detection benchmarks were organized by the polarity of
speech, such as "offensive" and "non-offensive", which were essentially hate
speech detection. However, in the real world, cyberbullying often attracted
widespread social attention through incidents. To address this problem, we
propose a novel annotation method to construct a cyberbullying dataset that
organized by incidents. The constructed CHNCI is the first Chinese
cyberbullying incident detection dataset, which consists of 220,676 comments in
91 incidents. Specifically, we first combine three cyberbullying detection
methods based on explanations generation as an ensemble method to generate the
pseudo labels, and then let human annotators judge these labels. Then we
propose the evaluation criteria for validating whether it constitutes a
cyberbullying incident. Experimental results demonstrate that the constructed
dataset can be a benchmark for the tasks of cyberbullying detection and
incident prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study for
the Chinese cyberbullying incident detection task.

*Yue Fang,Zhi Jin,Jie An,Hongshen Chen,Xiaohong Chen,Naijun Zhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一个名为STL-DivEn的数据集和KGST框架，用于自动将自然语言转换为信号时序逻辑（STL），解决了现有数据不足和转换准确性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动将自然语言转换为STL耗时且易错，而现有数据集不足限制了自动转换的发展。

Method: 通过小规模种子集、聚类和LLM生成扩展数据集，并引入KGST框架进行知识引导的转换。

Result: STL-DivEn数据集多样性优于现有数据集，KGST框架在转换准确性上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: STL-DivEn和KGST为自然语言到STL的自动转换提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal Logic (TL), especially Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enables precise
formal specification, making it widely used in cyber-physical systems such as
autonomous driving and robotics. Automatically transforming NL into STL is an
attractive approach to overcome the limitations of manual transformation, which
is time-consuming and error-prone. However, due to the lack of datasets,
automatic transformation currently faces significant challenges and has not
been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an NL-STL dataset named
STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), which comprises 16,000 samples enriched
with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a
small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are
identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in
generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured
through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation. Furthermore, we
introduce the Knowledge-Guided STL Transformation (KGST) framework, a novel
approach for transforming natural language into STL, involving a
generate-then-refine process based on external knowledge. Statistical analysis
shows that the STL-DivEn dataset exhibits more diversity than the existing
NL-STL dataset. Moreover, both metric-based and human evaluations indicate that
our KGST approach outperforms baseline models in transformation accuracy on
STL-DivEn and DeepSTL datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理主要关注单个动作的准确性，缺乏有效的错误检测和恢复机制。

Method: 提出BacktrackAgent框架，包含验证器、判断器和反射器模块，并开发了专门用于回溯机制的训练数据集。

Result: 在Mobile3M和Auto-UI基准测试中，任务成功率和步骤准确性均有提升。

Conclusion: BacktrackAgent通过回溯机制显著提升了GUI代理的性能，数据和代码将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have gained substantial attention due
to their impressive capabilities to complete tasks through multiple
interactions within GUI environments. However, existing agents primarily focus
on enhancing the accuracy of individual actions and often lack effective
mechanisms for detecting and recovering from errors. To address these
shortcomings, we propose the BacktrackAgent, a robust framework that
incorporates a backtracking mechanism to improve task completion efficiency.
BacktrackAgent includes verifier, judger, and reflector components as modules
for error detection and recovery, while also applying judgment rewards to
further enhance the agent's performance. Additionally, we develop a training
dataset specifically designed for the backtracking mechanism, which considers
the outcome pages after action executions. Experimental results show that
BacktrackAgent has achieved performance improvements in both task success rate
and step accuracy on Mobile3M and Auto-UI benchmarks. Our data and code will be
released upon acceptance.

*Yang He,Xiao Ding,Bibo Cai,Yufei Zhang,Kai Xiong,Zhouhao Sun,Bing Qin,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: Self-Route是一个动态推理框架，通过轻量级预推断阶段选择推理模式，显著减少不必要的token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLLMs在简单问题上过度推理导致的资源浪费问题。

Method: 引入轻量级预推断阶段提取能力感知嵌入，构建Gradient-10K数据集训练路由器。

Result: 在保持推理模型精度的同时，token消耗减少30-55%。

Conclusion: Self-Route具有广泛适用性和实用价值。

Abstract: While reasoning-augmented large language models (RLLMs) significantly enhance
complex task performance through extended reasoning chains, they inevitably
introduce substantial unnecessary token consumption, particularly for simpler
problems where Short Chain-of-Thought (Short CoT) suffices. This overthinking
phenomenon leads to inefficient resource usage without proportional accuracy
gains. To address this issue, we propose Self-Route, a dynamic reasoning
framework that automatically selects between general and reasoning modes based
on model capability estimation. Our approach introduces a lightweight
pre-inference stage to extract capability-aware embeddings from hidden layer
representations, enabling real-time evaluation of the model's ability to solve
problems. We further construct Gradient-10K, a model difficulty
estimation-based dataset with dense complexity sampling, to train the router
for precise capability boundary detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Self-Route achieves comparable accuracy to reasoning models while reducing
token consumption by 30-55\% across diverse benchmarks. The proposed framework
demonstrates consistent effectiveness across models with different parameter
scales and reasoning paradigms, highlighting its general applicability and
practical value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类在表达复杂句子前会进行思考的启发，将类似过程引入语言模型以提高性能。

Method: 在生成单个token时，模型通过重复前向传递生成加权词嵌入，并将其反馈为输入。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种架构（如GPT-2、Pythia、LLaMA）上有效，性能接近参数翻倍的普通模型，并在下游任务中显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法简单通用，能显著提升语言模型性能，尤其在资源有限时表现突出。

Abstract: Humans ponder before articulating complex sentence elements, enabling deeper
cognitive processing through focused effort. In this work, we introduce this
pondering process into language models by repeatedly invoking the forward
process within a single token generation step. During pondering, instead of
generating an actual token sampled from the prediction distribution, the model
ponders by yielding a weighted sum of all token embeddings according to the
predicted token distribution. The generated embedding is then fed back as input
for another forward pass. We show that the model can learn to ponder in this
way through self-supervised learning, without any human annotations. Our method
is straightforward and can be seamlessly integrated with various existing
language models. Experiments across three widely used open-source
architectures-GPT-2, Pythia, and LLaMA-and extensive downstream task
evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method. For
language modeling tasks, pondering language models achieve performance
comparable to vanilla models with twice the number of parameters. On 9
downstream benchmarks, our pondering-enhanced Pythia models significantly
outperform the official Pythia models. Notably, pondering-enhanced Pythia-1B is
comparable to TinyLlama-1.1B, which is trained on 10 times more data. The code

TLDR: 论文介绍了MultiManip数据集和SELF-PERCEPT框架，用于检测多人多轮对话中的心理操纵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理操纵在人际交流中普遍且难以检测，现有大语言模型（LLMs）在复杂对话中表现不佳。

Method: 提出MultiManip数据集和SELF-PERCEPT框架，基于自我感知理论的两阶段提示策略。

Result: LLMs（如GPT-4o和Llama-3.1-8B）在检测操纵时表现有限，SELF-PERCEPT框架效果显著。

Conclusion: SELF-PERCEPT框架能有效检测多人多轮心理操纵，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Mental manipulation is a subtle yet pervasive form of abuse in interpersonal
communication, making its detection critical for safeguarding potential
victims. However, due to manipulation's nuanced and context-specific nature,
identifying manipulative language in complex, multi-turn, and multi-person
conversations remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs).
To address this gap, we introduce the MultiManip dataset, comprising 220
multi-turn, multi-person dialogues balanced between manipulative and
non-manipulative interactions, all drawn from reality shows that mimic
real-world scenarios. For manipulative interactions, it includes 11 distinct
manipulations depicting real-life scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B, employing various
prompting strategies. Despite their capabilities, these models often struggle
to detect manipulation effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose
SELF-PERCEPT, a novel, two-stage prompting framework inspired by
Self-Perception Theory, demonstrating strong performance in detecting
multi-person, multi-turn mental manipulation. Our code and data are publicly
available at https://github.com/danushkhanna/self-percept .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索英语预训练模型在低资源印度语言上的适应性和表现，以提升多语言文本到语音（TTS）技术。

Method: 比较三种方法：(i)从头训练，(ii)用印度数据微调英语F5，(iii)同时用印度和英语数据微调以防止遗忘。

Result: 仅用印度数据微调的IN-F5表现最佳，能实现跨语言流利转换，并支持零资源语言的合成。

Conclusion: 英语预训练有助于低资源TTS达到人类水平，IN-F5展示了在多语言和零资源场景下的潜力。

Abstract: What happens when an English Fairytaler is fine-tuned on Indian languages? We
evaluate how the English F5-TTS model adapts to 11 Indian languages, measuring
polyglot fluency, voice-cloning, style-cloning, and code-mixing. We compare:
(i) training from scratch, (ii) fine-tuning English F5 on Indian data, and
(iii) fine-tuning on both Indian and English data to prevent forgetting.
Fine-tuning with only Indian data proves most effective and the resultant IN-F5
is a near-human polyglot; that enables speakers of one language (e.g., Odia) to
fluently speak in another (e.g., Hindi). Our results show English pretraining
aids low-resource TTS in reaching human parity. To aid progress in other
low-resource languages, we study data-constrained setups and arrive at a
compute optimal strategy. Finally, we show IN-F5 can synthesize unseen
languages like Bhojpuri and Tulu using a human-in-the-loop approach for
zero-resource TTS via synthetic data generation.

TLDR: DART是一种动态适应框架，通过选择性模仿专家推理轨迹，帮助小语言模型（SLMs）提升推理能力，解决与大型语言模型（LLMs）的能力差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理数据集通常针对强大的LLMs设计，直接应用于较弱的SLMs会导致性能下降，因此需要一种方法弥合能力差距。

Method: DART采用选择性模仿策略，通过解决方案模拟评估步骤适应性，当专家步骤超出学生能力时，学生自主探索替代推理路径。

Result: DART在多个推理基准测试和模型规模上显著提升泛化能力和数据效率，优于静态微调。

Conclusion: DART通过将训练信号与学生的推理能力对齐，提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，适用于资源受限模型的推理对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet aligning such abilities to small language models (SLMs) remains a challenge
due to distributional mismatches and limited model capacity. Existing reasoning
datasets, typically designed for powerful LLMs, often lead to degraded
performance when directly applied to weaker models. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Adaptation of Reasoning Trajectories (DART), a novel data adaptation
framework that bridges the capability gap between expert reasoning trajectories
and diverse SLMs. Instead of uniformly imitating expert steps, DART employs a
selective imitation strategy guided by step-wise adaptability estimation via
solution simulation. When expert steps surpass the student's capacity --
signaled by an Imitation Gap -- the student autonomously explores alternative
reasoning paths, constrained by outcome consistency. We validate DART across
multiple reasoning benchmarks and model scales, demonstrating that it
significantly improves generalization and data efficiency over static
fine-tuning. Our method enhances supervision quality by aligning training
signals with the student's reasoning capabilities, offering a scalable solution
for reasoning alignment in resource-constrained models.

TLDR: 研究探讨了小型语言模型（SLMs）在高中物理推理能力上的表现，发现其答案准确率较高但推理正确率低，表明模型依赖模式识别而非真正理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs在计算效率和可访问性上有优势，但其在复杂推理（如物理领域）的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用OpenStax高中物理教材构建数据集，结合Bloom分类法标注，并应用文化情境化方法。通过LLM-as-a-judge框架评估模型表现。

Result: Qwen 3 1.7B答案准确率达85%，但完全正确推理仅38%。数学符号格式对性能影响小，推理质量随认知复杂度下降。

Conclusion: SLMs需提升真实理解和可验证推理能力，而非仅关注答案准确率，才能成为可靠教育工具。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, making them promising for educational applications. However,
their capacity for complex reasoning, particularly in domains such as physics,
remains underexplored. This study investigates the high school physics
reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art SLMs (under 4 billion parameters),
including instruct versions of Llama 3.2, Phi 4 Mini, Gemma 3, and Qwen series.
We developed a comprehensive physics dataset from the OpenStax High School
Physics textbook, annotated according to Bloom's Taxonomy, with LaTeX and
plaintext mathematical notations. A novel cultural contextualization approach
was applied to a subset, creating culturally adapted problems for Asian,
African, and South American/Australian contexts while preserving core physics
principles. Using an LLM-as-a-judge framework with Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash,
we evaluated answer and reasoning chain correctness, along with calculation
accuracy. The results reveal significant differences between the SLMs. Qwen 3
1.7B achieved high `answer accuracy' (85%), but `fully correct reasoning' was
substantially low (38%). The format of the mathematical notation had a
negligible impact on performance. SLMs exhibited varied performance across the
physics topics and showed a decline in reasoning quality with increasing
cognitive and knowledge complexity. In particular, the consistency of reasoning
was largely maintained in diverse cultural contexts, especially by better
performing models. These findings indicate that, while SLMs can often find
correct answers, their underlying reasoning is frequently flawed, suggesting an
overreliance on pattern recognition. For SLMs to become reliable educational
tools in physics, future development must prioritize enhancing genuine
understanding and the generation of sound, verifiable reasoning chains over
mere answer accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在训练LLM代理处理复杂任务时面临延迟奖励的挑战，导致早期动作缺乏有效指导。

Method: 提出Stepwise Progress Attribution (SPA)框架，训练进度估计器分解最终奖励为逐步贡献，并结合环境信号作为中间奖励。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SPA在成功率和准确性上平均分别提升了2.5%和1.9%。

Conclusion: SPA通过提供更有效的中间奖励，显著提升了强化学习的训练效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) holds significant promise for training LLM agents
to handle complex, goal-oriented tasks that require multi-step interactions
with external environments. However, a critical challenge when applying RL to
these agentic tasks arises from delayed rewards: feedback signals are typically
available only after the entire task is completed. This makes it non-trivial to
assign delayed rewards to earlier actions, providing insufficient guidance
regarding environmental constraints and hindering agent training. In this work,
we draw on the insight that the ultimate completion of a task emerges from the
cumulative progress an agent makes across individual steps. We propose Stepwise
Progress Attribution (SPA), a general reward redistribution framework that
decomposes the final reward into stepwise contributions, each reflecting its
incremental progress toward overall task completion. To achieve this, we train
a progress estimator that accumulates stepwise contributions over a trajectory
to match the task completion. During policy optimization, we combine the
estimated per-step contribution with a grounding signal for actions executed in
the environment as the fine-grained, intermediate reward for effective agent
training. Extensive experiments on common agent benchmarks (including Webshop,
ALFWorld, and VirtualHome) demonstrate that SPA consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art method in both success rate (+2.5\% on average) and grounding
accuracy (+1.9\% on average). Further analyses demonstrate that our method
remarkably provides more effective intermediate rewards for RL training. Our
code is available at https://github.com/WangHanLinHenry/SPA-RL-Agent.

Motivation: LLM作为基准生成器被广泛用于可扩展评估，但其潜在的自偏差问题尚未充分研究。本文旨在系统定义和验证这种自偏差现象。

Method: 提出Silencer框架，利用多个生成器之间的异质性在样本和基准层面中和偏差，生成高质量、无自偏差的基准。

Result: 实验表明，Silencer能将自偏差降至接近零，显著提升生成基准的评估效果（Pearson相关系数从0.655提升至0.833），并表现出强泛化性。

Conclusion: Silencer是一种有效的通用框架，能够消除自偏差并生成高质量的评估基准。

Abstract: LLM-as-Benchmark-Generator methods have been widely studied as a supplement
to human annotators for scalable evaluation, while the potential biases within
this paradigm remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically define and
validate the phenomenon of inflated performance in models evaluated on their
self-generated benchmarks, referred to as self-bias, and attribute it to
sub-biases arising from question domain, language style, and wrong labels. On
this basis, we propose Silencer, a general framework that leverages the
heterogeneity between multiple generators at both the sample and benchmark
levels to neutralize bias and generate high-quality, self-bias-silenced
benchmark. Experimental results across various settings demonstrate that
Silencer can suppress self-bias to near zero, significantly improve evaluation
effectiveness of the generated benchmark (with an average improvement from
0.655 to 0.833 in Pearson correlation with high-quality human-annotated
benchmark), while also exhibiting strong generalizability.

Abstract: Faithfulness hallucination are claims generated by a Large Language Model
(LLM) not supported by contexts provided to the LLM. Lacking assessment
standard, existing benchmarks only contain "factual statements" that rephrase
source materials without marking "cognitive statements" that make inference
from the given context, making the consistency evaluation and optimization of
cognitive statements difficult. Inspired by how an evidence is assessed in the
legislative domain, we design a rigorous framework to assess different levels
of faithfulness of cognitive statements and create a benchmark dataset where we
reveal insightful statistics. We design an annotation pipeline to create larger
benchmarks for different LLMs automatically, and the resulting larger-scale
CogniBench-L dataset can be used to train accurate cognitive hallucination
detection model. We release our model and dataset at:

Conclusion: SpecExtend为长序列推测解码提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference
in large language models (LLMs), but its performance degrades on long inputs
due to increased attention cost and reduced draft accuracy. We introduce
SpecExtend, a drop-in enhancement that improves the performance of speculative
decoding on long sequences without any additional training. SpecExtend
integrates efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Hybrid
Tree Attention into both the draft and target models, reducing latency across
all stages. To improve draft accuracy and speed, we propose Cross-model
Retrieval, a novel KV cache update strategy that uses the target model's
attention scores to dynamically select relevant context for the draft model.
Extensive evaluations on three long-context understanding datasets show that
SpecExtend accelerates standard tree-based speculative decoding by up to 2.22x
for inputs up to 16K tokens, providing an effective solution for speculative
decoding of long sequences. The code is available at

Abstract: A hallmark of human innovation is the process of recombination -- creating
original ideas by integrating elements of existing mechanisms and concepts. In
this work, we automatically mine the scientific literature and build CHIMERA: a
large-scale knowledge base (KB) of recombination examples. CHIMERA can be used
to empirically explore at scale how scientists recombine concepts and take
inspiration from different areas, or to train supervised machine learning
models that learn to predict new creative cross-domain directions. To build
this KB, we present a novel information extraction task of extracting
recombination from scientific paper abstracts, collect a high-quality corpus of
hundreds of manually annotated abstracts, and use it to train an LLM-based
extraction model. The model is applied to a large corpus of papers in the AI
domain, yielding a KB of over 28K recombination examples. We analyze CHIMERA to
explore the properties of recombination in different subareas of AI. Finally,
we train a scientific hypothesis generation model using the KB, which predicts

TLDR: RePS是一种新的双向偏好优化方法，用于改进语言模型的表示引导，在概念引导和抑制上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有权重或表示调整方法在语言模型引导中效果不如提示方法，RePS旨在提供更有效的替代方案。

Method: 提出Reference-free Preference Steering (RePS)，通过双向偏好优化联合实现概念引导和抑制。

Result: 在Gemma模型上，RePS优于现有方法，接近提示效果，且在抑制任务中表现更好且抗攻击。

Conclusion: RePS为语言模型引导和抑制提供了可解释且鲁棒的替代方案。

Abstract: Steering methods for language models (LMs) seek to provide fine-grained and
interpretable control over model generations by variously changing model
inputs, weights, or representations to adjust behavior. Recent work has shown
that adjusting weights or representations is often less effective than steering
by prompting, for instance when wanting to introduce or suppress a particular
concept. We demonstrate how to improve representation steering via our new
Reference-free Preference Steering (RePS), a bidirectional
preference-optimization objective that jointly does concept steering and
suppression. We train three parameterizations of RePS and evaluate them on
AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark. On Gemma models with sizes
ranging from 2B to 27B, RePS outperforms all existing steering methods trained
with a language modeling objective and substantially narrows the gap with
prompting -- while promoting interpretability and minimizing parameter count.
In suppression, RePS matches the language-modeling objective on Gemma-2 and
outperforms it on the larger Gemma-3 variants while remaining resilient to
prompt-based jailbreaking attacks that defeat prompting. Overall, our results
suggest that RePS provides an interpretable and robust alternative to prompting
for both steering and suppression.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的知识图谱嵌入方法RSCF，通过保持关系语义一致性显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在关系特定实体转换中存在不一致性，导致嵌入的语义偏差丢失。

Method: RSCF采用共享仿射变换、根植实体转换和归一化处理，确保转换一致性。

Result: 在知识图谱补全任务中，RSCF显著优于现有方法，表现出对所有关系的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RSCF通过保持语义一致性，有效提升了知识图谱嵌入的性能。

Abstract: In knowledge graph embedding, leveraging relation-specific
entity-transformation has markedly enhanced performance. However, the
consistency of embedding differences before and after transformation remains
unaddressed, risking the loss of valuable inductive bias inherent in the
embeddings. This inconsistency stems from two problems. First, transformation
representations are specified for relations in a disconnected manner, allowing
dissimilar transformations and corresponding entity-embeddings for similar
relations. Second, a generalized plug-in approach as a SFBR (Semantic Filter
Based on Relations) disrupts this consistency through excessive concentration
of entity embeddings under entity-based regularization, generating
indistinguishable score distributions among relations. In this paper, we
introduce a plug-in KGE method, Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter (RSCF),
containing more consistent entity-transformation characterized by three
features: 1) shared affine transformation of relation embeddings across all
relations, 2) rooted entity-transformation that adds an entity embedding to its
change represented by the transformed vector, and 3) normalization of the
change to prevent scale reduction. To amplify the advantages of consistency
that preserve semantics on embeddings, RSCF adds relation transformation and
prediction modules for enhancing the semantics. In knowledge graph completion
tasks with distance-based and tensor decomposition models, RSCF significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art KGE methods, showing robustness across all
relations and their frequencies.

TLDR: MAMMQA是一个多模态问答框架，通过多智能体协作提升准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一推理策略，忽略了模态特性，限制了性能和可解释性。

Method: MAMMQA包含两个视觉语言模型（VLM）和一个文本大语言模型（LLM），分别负责分解问题、跨模态推理和整合答案。

Result: 在多模态问答基准测试中，MAMMQA在准确性和鲁棒性上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 多智能体协作框架显著提升了多模态问答的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal question answering have primarily focused on
combining heterogeneous modalities or fine-tuning multimodal large language
models. While these approaches have shown strong performance, they often rely
on a single, generalized reasoning strategy, overlooking the unique
characteristics of each modality ultimately limiting both accuracy and
interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose MAMMQA, a
multi-agent QA framework for multimodal inputs spanning text, tables, and
images. Our system includes two Visual Language Model (VLM) agents and one
text-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The first VLM decomposes the user
query into sub-questions and sequentially retrieves partial answers from each
modality. The second VLM synthesizes and refines these results through
cross-modal reasoning. Finally, the LLM integrates the insights into a cohesive
answer. This modular design enhances interpretability by making the reasoning
process transparent and allows each agent to operate within its domain of
expertise. Experiments on diverse multimodal QA benchmarks demonstrate that our
cooperative, multi-agent framework consistently outperforms existing baselines
in both accuracy and robustness.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该论文研究了知识编辑方法（KEs）在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的可追踪性和可逆性，特别关注ROME方法，提出了检测、追踪和逆转恶意编辑的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识编辑方法虽然能有效更新LLMs中的信息，但也可能被恶意利用植入错误信息或偏见，因此需要防御技术来检测和逆转这些编辑。

Method: 通过分析ROME方法编辑后的权重矩阵分布模式，定位编辑权重并预测被修改的事实关系，提出从修改权重推断编辑对象的方法，并展示ROME编辑的可逆性。

Result: 研究发现ROME编辑在权重矩阵中留下独特模式，可用于定位编辑权重并预测编辑事实，推断编辑对象的准确率超过95%，且编辑可逆性达80%以上。

Conclusion: 论文证明了通过编辑权重检测、追踪和逆转恶意编辑的可行性，为保护LLMs提供了稳健框架。

Abstract: Knowledge editing methods (KEs) are a cost-effective way to update the
factual content of large language models (LLMs), but they pose a dual-use risk.
While KEs are beneficial for updating outdated or incorrect information, they
can be exploited maliciously to implant misinformation or bias. In order to
defend against these types of malicious manipulation, we need robust techniques
that can reliably detect, interpret, and mitigate adversarial edits. This work
investigates the traceability and reversibility of knowledge edits, focusing on
the widely used Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) method. We first show that ROME
introduces distinctive distributional patterns in the edited weight matrices,
which can serve as effective signals for locating the edited weights. Second,
we show that these altered weights can reliably be used to predict the edited
factual relation, enabling partial reconstruction of the modified fact.
Building on this, we propose a method to infer the edited object entity
directly from the modified weights, without access to the editing prompt,
achieving over 95% accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that ROME edits can be
reversed, recovering the model's original outputs with $\geq$ 80% accuracy. Our
findings highlight the feasibility of detecting, tracing, and reversing edits
based on the edited weights, offering a robust framework for safeguarding LLMs
against adversarial manipulations.

Conclusion: RioRAG通过强化学习和分层次奖励建模，显著提升了长形式问答的性能。

Abstract: Long-form question answering (LFQA) presents unique challenges for large
language models, requiring the synthesis of coherent, paragraph-length answers.
While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a promising
solution, existing research struggles with key limitations: the scarcity of
high-quality training data for long-form generation, the compounding risk of
hallucination in extended outputs, and the absence of reliable evaluation
metrics for factual completeness. In this paper, we propose RioRAG, a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that advances long-form RAG through
reinforced informativeness optimization. Our approach introduces two
fundamental innovations to address the core challenges. First, we develop an RL
training paradigm of reinforced informativeness optimization that directly
optimizes informativeness and effectively addresses the slow-thinking deficit
in conventional RAG systems, bypassing the need for expensive supervised data.
Second, we propose a nugget-centric hierarchical reward modeling approach that
enables precise assessment of long-form answers through a three-stage process:
extracting the nugget from every source webpage, constructing a nugget claim
checklist, and computing rewards based on factual alignment. Extensive
experiments on two LFQA benchmarks LongFact and RAGChecker demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our codes are available at

Abstract: Identifying factors that make ad text attractive is essential for advertising
success. This study proposes AdParaphrase v2.0, a dataset for ad text
paraphrasing, containing human preference data, to enable the analysis of the
linguistic factors and to support the development of methods for generating

Method: 开发了一种意图隐藏对抗提示的攻击策略，并构建了博弈论框架分析攻击与防御系统的交互。

Result: 攻击在多个实际LLMs上验证有效，且优于现有对抗提示技术。

Conclusion: 为应对此类威胁，提出了一种针对意图隐藏攻击的防御机制。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, concerns about their safe
deployment have also grown. Although alignment mechanisms have been introduced
to deter misuse, they remain vulnerable to carefully designed adversarial
prompts. In this work, we present a scalable attack strategy: intent-hiding
adversarial prompting, which conceals malicious intent through the composition
of skills. We develop a game-theoretic framework to model the interaction
between such attacks and defense systems that apply both prompt and response
filtering. Our analysis identifies equilibrium points and reveals structural
advantages for the attacker. To counter these threats, we propose and analyze a
defense mechanism tailored to intent-hiding attacks. Empirically, we validate
the attack's effectiveness on multiple real-world LLMs across a range of
malicious behaviors, demonstrating clear advantages over existing adversarial
prompting techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAFT方法在缺乏可靠知识时仍生成答案，降低了高风险领域的可靠性。DTA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DTA将数据划分为四个知识象限，为每个象限构建偏好数据，并通过Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)优化模型。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，DTA有效平衡了准确性和适当弃权，提升了系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: DTA显著增强了检索增强系统的可信度，适用于高风险领域。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have
significantly advanced natural language processing tasks by integrating
external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually rich
responses. To improve the robustness of such systems against noisy retrievals,
Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) has emerged as a widely adopted method.
However, RAFT conditions models to generate answers even in the absence of
reliable knowledge. This behavior undermines their reliability in high-stakes
domains, where acknowledging uncertainty is critical. To address this issue, we
propose Divide-Then-Align (DTA), a post-training approach designed to endow RAG
systems with the ability to respond with "I don't know" when the query is out
of the knowledge boundary of both the retrieved passages and the model's
internal knowledge. DTA divides data samples into four knowledge quadrants and
constructs tailored preference data for each quadrant, resulting in a curated
dataset for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate that DTA effectively balances accuracy with
appropriate abstention, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of
retrieval-augmented systems.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在代码和数学任务中表现出色，但其在结构化空间知识内部化的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究通过模拟城市环境中的实验，测试LLMs在空间感知（推断全局布局）和空间导航（学习道路连通性并规划路径）的能力。

Result: LLMs不仅能推广到未见过的空间关系，其潜在表征也与真实空间分布一致，并能从轨迹描述中学习道路连通性以实现准确路径规划。

Conclusion: LLMs具备构建全局空间认知的潜力，为空间智能的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in tasks such as code and mathematics. However, their potential to
internalize structured spatial knowledge remains underexplored. This study
investigates whether LLMs, grounded in locally relative human observations, can
construct coherent global spatial cognition by integrating fragmented
relational descriptions. We focus on two core aspects of spatial cognition:
spatial perception, where models infer consistent global layouts from local
positional relationships, and spatial navigation, where models learn road
connectivity from trajectory data and plan optimal paths between unconnected
locations. Experiments conducted in a simulated urban environment demonstrate
that LLMs not only generalize to unseen spatial relationships between points of
interest (POIs) but also exhibit latent representations aligned with real-world
spatial distributions. Furthermore, LLMs can learn road connectivity from
trajectory descriptions, enabling accurate path planning and dynamic spatial
awareness during navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型评估主要基于标准美式英语，忽视了全球英语多样性，可能导致不公平，因此需评估模型在非标准英语变体上的表现。

Method: 结合语言学专家知识和基于LLM的转换，构建Trans-EnV框架，将六个基准数据集转换为38种英语变体，评估七种先进LLM。

Result: 非标准英语变体上的模型性能显著下降，准确率最高降低46.3%，揭示了语言鲁棒性的不足。

Conclusion: Trans-EnV框架为全面评估语言模型鲁棒性提供了有效工具，强调了多样化英语变体评估的必要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly evaluated on Standard American
English (SAE), often overlooking the diversity of global English varieties.
This narrow focus may raise fairness concerns as degraded performance on
non-standard varieties can lead to unequal benefits for users worldwide.
Therefore, it is critical to extensively evaluate the linguistic robustness of
LLMs on multiple non-standard English varieties. We introduce Trans-EnV, a
framework that automatically transforms SAE datasets into multiple English
varieties to evaluate the linguistic robustness. Our framework combines (1)
linguistics expert knowledge to curate variety-specific features and
transformation guidelines from linguistic literature and corpora, and (2)
LLM-based transformations to ensure both linguistic validity and scalability.
Using Trans-EnV, we transform six benchmark datasets into 38 English varieties
and evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal significant
performance disparities, with accuracy decreasing by up to 46.3% on
non-standard varieties. These findings highlight the importance of
comprehensive linguistic robustness evaluation across diverse English
varieties. Each construction of Trans-EnV was validated through rigorous
statistical testing and consultation with a researcher in the field of second
language acquisition, ensuring its linguistic validity. Our

Result: 实验表明，该系统能生成自然流畅的翻译，同时与源语音的时长和语速保持一致，翻译性能优异。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨语言配音提供了有效的解决方案，兼顾翻译质量和语音特性保留。

Abstract: This paper introduces a cross-lingual dubbing system that translates speech
from one language to another while preserving key characteristics such as
duration, speaker identity, and speaking speed. Despite the strong translation
quality of existing speech translation approaches, they often overlook the
transfer of speech patterns, leading to mismatches with source speech and
limiting their suitability for dubbing applications. To address this, we
propose a discrete diffusion-based speech-to-unit translation model with
explicit duration control, enabling time-aligned translation. We then
synthesize speech based on the predicted units and source identity with a
conditional flow matching model. Additionally, we introduce a unit-based speed
adaptation mechanism that guides the translation model to produce speech at a
rate consistent with the source, without relying on any text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework generates natural and fluent
translations that align with the original speech's duration and speaking pace,
while achieving competitive translation performance.

Abstract: As large vision language models(LVLMs) rapidly advance, concerns about their
potential to learn and generate social biases and stereotypes are increasing.
Previous studies on LVLM's stereotypes face two primary limitations: metrics
that overlooked the importance of content words, and datasets that overlooked
the effect of color. To address these limitations, this study introduces new
evaluation metrics based on the Stereotype Content Model (SCM). We also propose
BASIC, a benchmark for assessing gender, race, and color stereotypes. Using SCM
metrics and BASIC, we conduct a study with eight LVLMs to discover stereotypes.
As a result, we found three findings. (1) The SCM-based evaluation is effective
in capturing stereotypes. (2) LVLMs exhibit color stereotypes in the output
along with gender and race ones. (3) Interaction between model architecture and
parameter sizes seems to affect stereotypes. We release BASIC publicly on
[anonymized for review].

Motivation: 探讨LLM微调过程中先前知识对校准性的影响，揭示其与数据重叠导致的校准问题。

Method: 提出CogCalib框架，根据模型的先前知识应用针对性学习策略。

Result: 在7个任务和3种LLM家族中，CogCalib显著提升校准性，ECE平均降低57%，且性能未受影响。

Conclusion: CogCalib有效解决了LLM微调中的校准问题，提升了模型在关键人机交互应用中的可靠性和客观性。

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) often demonstrate poor calibration,
with their confidence scores misaligned with actual performance. While
calibration has been extensively studied in models trained from scratch, the
impact of LLMs' prior knowledge on calibration during fine-tuning remains
understudied. Our research reveals that LLMs' prior knowledge causes potential
poor calibration due to the ubiquitous presence of known data in real-world
fine-tuning, which appears harmful for calibration. Specifically, data aligned
with LLMs' prior knowledge would induce overconfidence, while new knowledge
improves calibration. Our findings expose a tension: LLMs' encyclopedic
knowledge, while enabling task versatility, undermines calibration through
unavoidable knowledge overlaps. To address this, we propose CogCalib, a
cognition-aware framework that applies targeted learning strategies according
to the model's prior knowledge. Experiments across 7 tasks using 3 LLM families
prove that CogCalib significantly improves calibration while maintaining
performance, achieving an average 57\% reduction in ECE compared to standard
fine-tuning in Llama3-8B. These improvements generalize well to out-of-domain
tasks, enhancing the objectivity and reliability of domain-specific LLMs, and
making them more trustworthy for critical human-AI interaction applications.

Abstract: Users interacting with large language models (LLMs) under their real
identifiers often unknowingly risk disclosing private information.
Automatically notifying users whether their queries leak privacy and which
phrases leak what private information has therefore become a practical need.
Existing privacy detection methods, however, were designed for different
objectives and application scenarios, typically tagging personally identifiable
information (PII) in anonymous content. In this work, to support the
development and evaluation of privacy detection models for LLM interactions
that are deployable on local user devices, we construct a large-scale
multilingual dataset with 249K user queries and 154K annotated privacy phrases.
In particular, we build an automated privacy annotation pipeline with
cloud-based strong LLMs to automatically extract privacy phrases from dialogue
datasets and annotate leaked information. We also design evaluation metrics at
the levels of privacy leakage, extracted privacy phrase, and privacy
information. We further establish baseline methods using light-weight LLMs with
both tuning-free and tuning-based methods, and report a comprehensive
evaluation of their performance. Evaluation results reveal a gap between
current performance and the requirements of real-world LLM applications,
motivating future research into more effective local privacy detection methods
grounded in our dataset.

TLDR: LLM-AT框架自动选择LLM层级以平衡成本与性能，无需训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂NLP任务中如何选择合适LLM层级以优化成本与性能的问题。

Method: LLM-AT由Starter、Generator和Judge组成，迭代选择LLM层级并验证响应有效性。

Result: 实验表明LLM-AT在降低成本的同时提升性能。

Conclusion: LLM-AT是实际应用中平衡成本与性能的实用解决方案。

Abstract: LLM providers typically offer multiple LLM tiers, varying in performance and
price. As NLP tasks become more complex and modularized, selecting the suitable
LLM tier for each subtask is a key challenge to balance between cost and
performance. To address the problem, we introduce LLM Automatic Transmission
(LLM-AT) framework that automatically selects LLM tiers without training.
LLM-AT consists of Starter, Generator, and Judge. The starter selects the
initial LLM tier expected to solve the given question, the generator produces a
response using the LLM of the selected tier, and the judge evaluates the
validity of the response. If the response is invalid, LLM-AT iteratively
upgrades to a higher-tier model, generates a new response, and re-evaluates
until a valid response is obtained. Additionally, we propose accuracy
estimator, which enables the suitable initial LLM tier selection without
training. Given an input question, accuracy estimator estimates the expected
accuracy of each LLM tier by computing the valid response rate across top-k
similar queries from past inference records. Experiments demonstrate that
LLM-AT achieves superior performance while reducing costs, making it a
practical solution for real-world applications.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为HoE的轻量级、参数高效且即插即用的方法，用于解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在多目标对齐中的挑战，无需重新训练即可适应多样化的用户偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多目标对齐中难以有效平衡冲突的偏好，通常需要昂贵的重新训练或导致次优结果。

Method: HoE方法包含三个层次组件：LoRA专家、路由专家和偏好路由，通过混合专家机制实现参数大小、训练成本和性能之间的权衡。

Result: 在14个目标和6个基准测试中的200种不同偏好上，HoE表现优于15种基线方法。

Conclusion: HoE是一种高效且灵活的方法，能够在不重新训练的情况下实现多目标对齐，适用于多样化的用户偏好。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously satisfy multiple
objectives remains a significant challenge, especially given the diverse and
often conflicting nature of human preferences. Existing alignment methods
struggle to balance trade-offs effectively, often requiring costly retraining
or yielding suboptimal results across the Pareto frontier of preferences. In
this paper, we introduce \textit{HoE}(Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts), a
\textit{lightweight}, \textit{parameter-efficient}, and \textit{plug-and-play}
approach that eliminates the need for model training, while enabling LLMs to
adapt across the entire Pareto frontier and accommodate diverse user
preferences. In particular, \textit{HoE} consists of three hierarchical
components: LoRA Experts, Router Experts and Preference Routing, reaching
optimal Pareto frontiers and achieving a trade-off between parameter size,
training cost, and performance. We evaluate \textit{HoE} across various tasks
on 14 objectives and 200 different preferences among 6 benchmarks,
demonstrating superior performance over 15 recent baselines. Code is available
in the supplementary materials.

TLDR: InfoComp是一种新的持续文本分类方法，通过分离任务特定和任务无关的知识，利用信息论框架优化提示学习，显著减少灾难性遗忘并提升知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注任务特定知识，忽视了共享知识的价值，受互补学习系统理论启发，提出InfoComp以更全面地学习。

Method: 设计P-Prompt和S-Prompt分别编码任务特定和任务无关知识，采用信息论框架优化提示学习，提出两种新损失函数。

Result: 在多个持续文本分类基准测试中，InfoComp优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: InfoComp通过分离和优化提示学习，有效解决了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘和知识迁移问题。

Abstract: Continual Text Classification (CTC) aims to continuously classify new text
data over time while minimizing catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired
knowledge. However, existing methods often focus on task-specific knowledge,
overlooking the importance of shared, task-agnostic knowledge. Inspired by the
complementary learning systems theory, which posits that humans learn
continually through the interaction of two systems -- the hippocampus,
responsible for forming distinct representations of specific experiences, and
the neocortex, which extracts more general and transferable representations
from past experiences -- we introduce Information-Theoretic Complementary
Prompts (InfoComp), a novel approach for CTC. InfoComp explicitly learns two
distinct prompt spaces: P(rivate)-Prompt and S(hared)-Prompt. These
respectively encode task-specific and task-invariant knowledge, enabling models
to sequentially learn classification tasks without relying on data replay. To
promote more informative prompt learning, InfoComp uses an
information-theoretic framework that maximizes mutual information between
different parameters (or encoded representations). Within this framework, we
design two novel loss functions: (1) to strengthen the accumulation of
task-specific knowledge in P-Prompt, effectively mitigating catastrophic
forgetting, and (2) to enhance the retention of task-invariant knowledge in
S-Prompt, improving forward knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on
diverse CTC benchmarks show that our approach outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLM的优势和局限性，并提出了一种新的表情包理解策略。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive and systematic analysis of
vision-language models (VLMs) for disparate meme classification tasks. We
introduced a novel approach that generates a VLM-based understanding of meme
images and fine-tunes the LLMs on textual understanding of the embedded meme
text for improving the performance. Our contributions are threefold: (1)
Benchmarking VLMs with diverse prompting strategies purposely to each sub-task;
(2) Evaluating LoRA fine-tuning across all VLM components to assess performance
gains; and (3) Proposing a novel approach where detailed meme interpretations
generated by VLMs are used to train smaller language models (LLMs),
significantly improving classification. The strategy of combining VLMs with
LLMs improved the baseline performance by 8.34%, 3.52% and 26.24% for sarcasm,
offensive and sentiment classification, respectively. Our results reveal the
strengths and limitations of VLMs and present a novel strategy for meme
understanding.

Motivation: 探讨NLP研究中“人工智能”一词的具体含义，以及研究者对“智能”的理解及其在研究议程中的作用。

Method: 对来自NLP、机器学习、认知科学等领域的303名研究者进行问卷调查，分析他们对“智能”的定义和看法。

Result: 社区最认同的智能标准是泛化性、适应性和推理能力；仅29%认为当前NLP系统“智能”，16.2%将开发智能系统作为研究目标。

Conclusion: 当前NLP系统被普遍认为不够智能，且开发智能系统并非主流研究目标，少数持此目标的研究者更倾向于认为现有系统智能。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of ''artificial intelligence'' (AI) framing in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) research, it is not clear what researchers
mean by ''intelligence''. To that end, we present the results of a survey on
the notion of ''intelligence'' among researchers and its role in the research
agenda. The survey elicited complete responses from 303 researchers from a
variety of fields including NLP, Machine Learning (ML), Cognitive Science,
Linguistics, and Neuroscience. We identify 3 criteria of intelligence that the
community agrees on the most: generalization, adaptability, & reasoning. Our
results suggests that the perception of the current NLP systems as
''intelligent'' is a minority position (29%). Furthermore, only 16.2% of the
respondents see developing intelligent systems as a research goal, and these
respondents are more likely to consider the current systems intelligent.

Motivation: 在线讨论的增多需要高级内容审核，而德语报纸论坛的研究较少，且现有研究常忽略平台特定上下文。

Method: 使用LSTM、CNN和ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo模型，结合One Million Posts Corpus数据，评估上下文感知模型的效果。

Result: CNN和LSTM模型受益于上下文信息，表现优异；ChatGPT的零样本分类未提升且表现较差。

Conclusion: 上下文信息对LSTM和CNN模型有效，而ChatGPT在此任务中表现不佳。

Abstract: The increasing volume of online discussions requires advanced automatic
content moderation to maintain responsible discourse. While hate speech
detection on social media is well-studied, research on German-language
newspaper forums remains limited. Existing studies often neglect
platform-specific context, such as user history and article themes. This paper
addresses this gap by developing and evaluating binary classification models
for automatic content moderation in German newspaper forums, incorporating
contextual information. Using LSTM, CNN, and ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo, and leveraging
the One Million Posts Corpus from the Austrian newspaper Der Standard, we
assess the impact of context-aware models. Results show that CNN and LSTM
models benefit from contextual information and perform competitively with
state-of-the-art approaches. In contrast, ChatGPT's zero-shot classification
does not improve with added context and underperforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAC系统在个性化表示和生成内容去毒方面存在不足，导致用户体验下降和潜在公关问题。

Method: 提出LaD模型，分层捕获长短期用户兴趣，并基于Reject Preference Optimization（RPO）实现自适应去毒。

Result: 在工业级数据集和在线A/B测试中取得显著改进，模型已部署在快手搜索中，服务数亿用户。

Conclusion: LaD模型有效解决了QAC系统的两大挑战，实现了高性能和安全的查询补全。

Abstract: Query auto-completion (QAC) plays a crucial role in modern search systems.
However, in real-world applications, there are two pressing challenges that
still need to be addressed. First, there is a need for hierarchical
personalized representations for users. Previous approaches have typically used
users' search behavior as a single, overall representation, which proves
inadequate in more nuanced generative scenarios. Additionally, query prefixes
are typically short and may contain typos or sensitive information, increasing
the likelihood of generating toxic content compared to traditional text
generation tasks. Such toxic content can degrade user experience and lead to
public relations issues. Therefore, the second critical challenge is
detoxifying QAC systems.
  To address these two limitations, we propose a novel model (LaD) that
captures personalized information from both long-term and short-term interests,
incorporating adaptive detoxification. In LaD, personalized information is
captured hierarchically at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels. This
approach preserves as much personalized information as possible while enabling
online generation within time constraints. To move a futher step, we propose an
online training method based on Reject Preference Optimization (RPO). By
incorporating a special token [Reject] during both the training and inference
processes, the model achieves adaptive detoxification. Consequently, the
generated text presented to users is both non-toxic and relevant to the given
prefix. We conduct comprehensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets and
perform online A/B tests, delivering the largest single-experiment metric
improvement in nearly two years of our product. Our model has been deployed on
Kuaishou search, driving the primary traffic for hundreds of millions of active
users. The code is available at https://github.com/JXZe/LaD.

Motivation: LLM在复杂推理任务中表现优异但存在幻觉问题，而知识图谱虽提供结构化知识但缺乏灵活推理能力。RAR旨在结合两者优势。

Method: RAR包含三个组件：Reasoner生成推理链，Aligner将其映射到KG路径，Responser合成最终答案。采用EM算法优化。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ上分别达到93.3%和91.0%的Hit@1分数，零样本泛化能力强且推理高效。

Conclusion: RAR成功整合LLM与KG，显著提升KGQA性能，并生成高质量、可解释的推理链。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks,
yet they often suffer from hallucinations and lack reliable factual grounding.
Meanwhile, knowledge graphs (KGs) provide structured factual knowledge but lack
the flexible reasoning abilities of LLMs. In this paper, we present
Reason-Align-Respond (RAR), a novel framework that systematically integrates
LLM reasoning with knowledge graphs for KGQA. Our approach consists of three
key components: a Reasoner that generates human-like reasoning chains, an
Aligner that maps these chains to valid KG paths, and a Responser that
synthesizes the final answer. We formulate this process as a probabilistic
model and optimize it using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which
iteratively refines the reasoning chains and knowledge paths. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of RAR,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with Hit@1 scores of 93.3% and 91.0% on
WebQSP and CWQ respectively. Human evaluation confirms that RAR generates
high-quality, interpretable reasoning chains well-aligned with KG paths.
Furthermore, RAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization capabilities and
maintains computational efficiency during inference.

Conclusion: LLM反向生成树库结合对比学习预训练有效提升了跨领域选区解析性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain constituency parsing is still an unsolved challenge in
computational linguistics since the available multi-domain constituency
treebank is limited. We investigate automatic treebank generation by large
language models (LLMs) in this paper. The performance of LLMs on constituency
parsing is poor, therefore we propose a novel treebank generation method, LLM
back generation, which is similar to the reverse process of constituency
parsing. LLM back generation takes the incomplete cross-domain constituency
tree with only domain keyword leaf nodes as input and fills the missing words
to generate the cross-domain constituency treebank. Besides, we also introduce
a span-level contrastive learning pre-training strategy to make full use of the
LLM back generation treebank for cross-domain constituency parsing. We verify
the effectiveness of our LLM back generation treebank coupled with contrastive
learning pre-training on five target domains of MCTB. Experimental results show
that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average results
compared with various baselines.

Result: 实验显示18个测试的MLLMs普遍存在模态偏好，且偏好方向可通过表示工程调整。该方法在下游任务中（如幻觉缓解和多模态机器翻译）表现优异。

Conclusion: MLLMs存在模态偏好，通过表示工程可有效控制和调整这种偏好，为多模态任务优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
on complex tasks with multimodal context. However, it is still understudied
whether they exhibit modality preference when processing multimodal contexts.
To study this question, we first build a \textbf{MC\textsuperscript{2}}
benchmark under controlled evidence conflict scenarios to systematically
evaluate modality preference, which is the tendency to favor one modality over
another when making decisions based on multimodal conflicting evidence. Our
extensive evaluation reveals that all 18 tested MLLMs generally demonstrate
clear modality bias, and modality preference can be influenced by external
interventions. An in-depth analysis reveals that the preference direction can
be captured within the latent representations of MLLMs. Built on this, we
propose a probing and steering method based on representation engineering to
explicitly control modality preference without additional fine-tuning or
carefully crafted prompts. Our method effectively amplifies modality preference
toward a desired direction and applies to downstream tasks such as
hallucination mitigation and multimodal machine translation, yielding promising
improvements.

Result: 提供间接和实证证据，表明oproj在推理中起核心作用，而其他模块更多支持对话流畅性。

Conclusion: 为LLM可解释性提供新视角，并为更高效的针对性训练策略开辟途径。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs), the
process of endowing them with new capabilities--such as mathematical
reasoning--remains largely empirical and opaque. A critical open question is
whether reasoning abilities stem from the entire model, specific modules, or
are merely artifacts of overfitting. In this work, we hypothesize that the
reasoning capabilities in well-trained LLMs are primarily attributed to the
output projection module (oproj) in the Transformer's multi-head self-attention
(MHSA) mechanism. To support this hypothesis, we introduce Stethoscope for
Networks (SfN), a suite of diagnostic tools designed to probe and analyze the
internal behaviors of LLMs. Using SfN, we provide both circumstantial and
empirical evidence suggesting that oproj plays a central role in enabling
reasoning, whereas other modules contribute more to fluent dialogue. These
findings offer a new perspective on LLM interpretability and open avenues for
more targeted training strategies, potentially enabling more efficient and
specialized LLMs.

Method: 对40名英语说话者的舌头形状数据进行广义Procrustes分析，并使用似然比框架评估区分潜力。

Result: 舌头大小是最具区分力的特征，前部舌头形状变化优于后部。形状信息在特定条件下可与大小和形状信息媲美。

Conclusion: 舌头形状特征在说话人区分中具有潜力，但需考虑特征间的共变关系。

Abstract: The way speakers articulate is well known to be variable across individuals
while at the same time subject to anatomical and biomechanical constraints. In
this study, we ask whether articulatory strategy in vowel production can be
sufficiently speaker-specific to form the basis for speaker discrimination. We
conducted Generalised Procrustes Analyses of tongue shape data from 40 English
speakers from the North West of England, and assessed the
speaker-discriminatory potential of orthogonal tongue shape features within the
framework of likelihood ratios. Tongue size emerged as the individual dimension
with the strongest discriminatory power, while tongue shape variation in the
more anterior part of the tongue generally outperformed tongue shape variation
in the posterior part. When considered in combination, shape-only information
may offer comparable levels of speaker specificity to size-and-shape
information, but only when features do not exhibit speaker-level co-variation.

Conclusion: 揭示了示例数量如何通过减少EU提升ICL的可信度和性能，并探索了内部置信度演变的机制。

Abstract: Recent advances in handling long sequences have facilitated the exploration
of long-context in-context learning (ICL). While much of the existing research
emphasizes performance improvements driven by additional in-context examples,
the influence on the trustworthiness of generated responses remains
underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by investigating how increased
examples influence predictive uncertainty, an essential aspect in
trustworthiness. We begin by systematically quantifying the uncertainty of ICL
with varying shot counts, analyzing the impact of example quantity. Through
uncertainty decomposition, we introduce a novel perspective on performance
enhancement, with a focus on epistemic uncertainty (EU). Our results reveal
that additional examples reduce total uncertainty in both simple and complex
tasks by injecting task-specific knowledge, thereby diminishing EU and
enhancing performance. For complex tasks, these advantages emerge only after
addressing the increased noise and uncertainty associated with longer inputs.
Finally, we explore the evolution of internal confidence across layers,
unveiling the mechanisms driving the reduction in uncertainty.

Result: LLMs利用频率偏差进行推理，微调后更依赖此偏差，且频率偏差与文本蕴含相关。

Conclusion: 学习频率模式能提升模型推理性能，但需注意其局限性。

Abstract: While fine-tuning LLMs on NLI corpora improves their inferential performance,
the underlying mechanisms driving this improvement remain largely opaque. In
this work, we conduct a series of experiments to investigate what LLMs actually
learn during fine-tuning. We begin by analyzing predicate frequencies in
premises and hypotheses across NLI datasets and identify a consistent frequency
bias, where predicates in hypotheses occur more frequently than those in
premises for positive instances. To assess the impact of this bias, we evaluate
both standard and NLI fine-tuned LLMs on bias-consistent and bias-adversarial
cases. We find that LLMs exploit frequency bias for inference and perform
poorly on adversarial instances. Furthermore, fine-tuned LLMs exhibit
significantly increased reliance on this bias, suggesting that they are
learning these frequency patterns from datasets. Finally, we compute the
frequencies of hyponyms and their corresponding hypernyms from WordNet,
revealing a correlation between frequency bias and textual entailment. These
findings help explain why learning frequency patterns can enhance model
performance on inference tasks.

Conclusion: LLM推理技术对DTS至关重要，Def-DTS为领域无关的对话处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dialogue Topic Segmentation (DTS) aims to divide dialogues into coherent
segments. DTS plays a crucial role in various NLP downstream tasks, but suffers
from chronic problems: data shortage, labeling ambiguity, and incremental
complexity of recently proposed solutions. On the other hand, Despite advances
in Large Language Models (LLMs) and reasoning strategies, these have rarely
been applied to DTS. This paper introduces Def-DTS: Deductive Reasoning for
Open-domain Dialogue Topic Segmentation, which utilizes LLM-based multi-step
deductive reasoning to enhance DTS performance and enable case study using
intermediate result. Our method employs a structured prompting approach for
bidirectional context summarization, utterance intent classification, and
deductive topic shift detection. In the intent classification process, we
propose the generalizable intent list for domain-agnostic dialogue intent
classification. Experiments in various dialogue settings demonstrate that
Def-DTS consistently outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art approaches,
with each subtask contributing to improved performance, particularly in
reducing type 2 error. We also explore the potential for autolabeling,
emphasizing the importance of LLM reasoning techniques in DTS.

Conclusion: FCKT通过细粒度知识转移有效解决了TSA中的负迁移问题，提升了任务性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the task of targeted sentiment analysis (TSA),
which involves two sub-tasks, i.e., identifying specific aspects from reviews
and determining their corresponding sentiments. Aspect extraction forms the
foundation for sentiment prediction, highlighting the critical dependency
between these two tasks for effective cross-task knowledge transfer. While most
existing studies adopt a multi-task learning paradigm to align task-specific
features in the latent space, they predominantly rely on coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. Such approaches lack fine-grained control over
aspect-sentiment relationships, often assuming uniform sentiment polarity
within related aspects. This oversimplification neglects contextual cues that
differentiate sentiments, leading to negative transfer. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FCKT, a fine-grained cross-task knowledge transfer
framework tailored for TSA. By explicitly incorporating aspect-level
information into sentiment prediction, FCKT achieves fine-grained knowledge
transfer, effectively mitigating negative transfer and enhancing task
performance. Experiments on three datasets, including comparisons with various
baselines and large language models (LLMs), demonstrate the effectiveness of
FCKT. The source code is available on https://github.com/cwei01/FCKT.

### [93] [Visual Cues Enhance Predictive Turn-Taking for Two-Party Human Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21043)
*Sam O'Connor Russell,Naomi Harte*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: MM-VAP是一种结合语音和视觉线索（如面部表情、头部姿势和注视）的多模态预测轮转模型，在视频会议互动中表现优于仅依赖语音的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测轮转模型主要依赖语音，忽略了多模态线索的重要性，尤其是在面对面互动中。

Method: 提出MM-VAP模型，整合语音和视觉特征，并通过按静默时长分组分析轮转行为。

Result: MM-VAP在所有轮转静默时长中均优于仅音频模型，其中面部表情特征贡献最大。

Conclusion: 视觉线索对轮转预测至关重要，未来工作应进一步探索多模态模型的应用。

Abstract: Turn-taking is richly multimodal. Predictive turn-taking models (PTTMs)
facilitate naturalistic human-robot interaction, yet most rely solely on
speech. We introduce MM-VAP, a multimodal PTTM which combines speech with
visual cues including facial expression, head pose and gaze. We find that it
outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-only in videoconferencing interactions
(84% vs. 79% hold/shift prediction accuracy). Unlike prior work which
aggregates all holds and shifts, we group by duration of silence between turns.
This reveals that through the inclusion of visual features, MM-VAP outperforms
a state-of-the-art audio-only turn-taking model across all durations of speaker
transitions. We conduct a detailed ablation study, which reveals that facial
expression features contribute the most to model performance. Thus, our working
hypothesis is that when interlocutors can see one another, visual cues are
vital for turn-taking and must therefore be included for accurate turn-taking
prediction. We additionally validate the suitability of automatic speech
alignment for PTTM training using telephone speech. This work represents the
first comprehensive analysis of multimodal PTTMs. We discuss implications for
future work and make all code publicly available.

TLDR: 论文提出Implicit-VidSRL数据集，用于解决语义角色标注（SRL）中隐含参数缺失的问题，并通过多模态烹饪过程提升上下文推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SRL基准常忽略隐含参数，导致对步骤理解不完整。

Method: 引入Implicit-VidSRL数据集，要求从多模态烹饪过程中推断显式和隐含参数。

Result: 多模态大模型在预测隐含参数时表现不佳，提出的iSRL-Qwen2-VL模型在F1分数上显著优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: Implicit-VidSRL和iSRL-Qwen2-VL为提升多模态上下文推理提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Procedural texts help AI enhance reasoning about context and action
sequences. Transforming these into Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) improves
understanding of individual steps by identifying predicate-argument structure
like {verb,what,where/with}. Procedural instructions are highly elliptic, for
instance, (i) add cucumber to the bowl and (ii) add sliced tomatoes, the second
step's where argument is inferred from the context, referring to where the
cucumber was placed. Prior SRL benchmarks often miss implicit arguments,
leading to incomplete understanding. To address this, we introduce
Implicit-VidSRL, a dataset that necessitates inferring implicit and explicit
arguments from contextual information in multimodal cooking procedures. Our
proposed dataset benchmarks multimodal models' contextual reasoning, requiring
entity tracking through visual changes in recipes. We study recent multimodal
LLMs and reveal that they struggle to predict implicit arguments of what and
where/with from multi-modal procedural data given the verb. Lastly, we propose
iSRL-Qwen2-VL, which achieves a 17% relative improvement in F1-score for
what-implicit and a 14.7% for where/with-implicit semantic roles over GPT-4o.

TLDR: FRANQ是一种新方法，用于检测RAG输出中的幻觉，通过不确定性量化技术区分事实性和忠实性，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在开放域问答中表现优异，但仍易产生幻觉（事实错误输出）。现有方法常混淆事实性与忠实性，导致误判。

Method: 提出FRANQ方法，结合不确定性量化技术，根据输出是否忠实于检索内容来评估事实性。

Result: 在多个数据集和LLM上的实验表明，FRANQ能更准确地检测RAG生成响应中的事实错误。

Conclusion: FRANQ通过区分事实性和忠实性，显著提升了幻觉检测的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with external knowledge retrieval, an
approach known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), have shown strong
performance in open-domain question answering. However, RAG systems remain
susceptible to hallucinations: factually incorrect outputs that may arise
either from inconsistencies in the model's internal knowledge or incorrect use
of the retrieved context. Existing approaches often conflate factuality with
faithfulness to the retrieved context, misclassifying factually correct
statements as hallucinations if they are not directly supported by the
retrieval. In this paper, we introduce FRANQ (Faithfulness-based Retrieval
Augmented UNcertainty Quantification), a novel method for hallucination
detection in RAG outputs. FRANQ applies different Uncertainty Quantification
(UQ) techniques to estimate factuality based on whether a statement is faithful
to the retrieved context or not. To evaluate FRANQ and other UQ techniques for
RAG, we present a new long-form Question Answering (QA) dataset annotated for
both factuality and faithfulness, combining automated labeling with manual
validation of challenging examples. Extensive experiments on long- and
short-form QA across multiple datasets and LLMs show that FRANQ achieves more
accurate detection of factual errors in RAG-generated responses compared to
existing methods.

TLDR: RPM框架通过推理级个性化，提升黑盒大语言模型的输出准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒大语言模型（LLMs）的通用响应忽略了用户偏好和推理风格，现有方法仅关注响应级个性化，未能建模个人思考过程。

Method: RPM框架通过提取用户历史中的特征构建统计用户特定因素，并构建个性化推理路径，在推理阶段通过特征相似性检索对齐的示例。

Result: 实验表明，RPM在多样化任务中优于响应级个性化方法。

Conclusion: 推理级个性化能有效提升黑盒LLMs的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language tasks and are now widely used in
real-world applications. Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without
access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and
ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically
produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning
styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization,
which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying
model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on
response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without
modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM,
a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's
reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs
statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping
response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized
reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the
inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via
feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured
factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow
user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization
enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model
outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive
experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms
response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of
reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在孟加拉语和文化知识方面的表现尚未达到主流语言（如英语）的水平，因此需要专门的评估工具。

Method: 数据集来自大学和职业考试的题库，涵盖文化和语言学知识，并测试了6个专有和3个开源LLMs。

Result: LLMs整体表现尚可，但在孟加拉语音学方面存在困难，表明孟加拉语是一种中等资源语言。

Conclusion: BLUCK是首个专注于孟加拉文化和语言学的多选题评估基准，填补了相关领域的空白。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce BLUCK, a new dataset designed to measure the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Bengali linguistic understanding
and cultural knowledge. Our dataset comprises 2366 multiple-choice questions
(MCQs) carefully curated from compiled collections of several college and job
level examinations and spans 23 categories covering knowledge on Bangladesh's
culture and history and Bengali linguistics. We benchmarked BLUCK using 6
proprietary and 3 open-source LLMs - including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet,
Gemini-1.5-Pro, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, and DeepSeekV3. Our results show that
while these models perform reasonably well overall, they, however, struggles in
some areas of Bengali phonetics. Although current LLMs' performance on Bengali
cultural and linguistic contexts is still not comparable to that of mainstream
languages like English, our results indicate Bengali's status as a mid-resource
language. Importantly, BLUCK is also the first MCQ-based evaluation benchmark
that is centered around native Bengali culture, history, and linguistics.

TLDR: 通过引入四阶段任务（快速思考、验证、慢速思考和总结），改进大型语言模型在问答任务中的推理能力，显著提升准确率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在问答任务中的推理能力虽可通过强化学习提升，但其搜索行为常不精确且缺乏信心，导致冗长回答。受心理学双过程理论启发，提出改进方法。

Method: 设计四阶段任务：快速思考（严格token限制）、验证、慢速思考（更深入思考）和总结（提炼精确步骤）。

Result: Qwen2.5-1.5B准确率从24.9%提升至27.9%，DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B从45.9%提升至49.8%。快速思考模式仅用1000token即达26.8%准确率。

Conclusion: 直觉与深思熟虑推理是互补系统，针对性训练可显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent studies show that the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) can be improved by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
question-answering (QA) tasks in areas such as math and coding. With a long
context length, LLMs may learn to perform search, as indicated by the
self-correction behavior observed in DeepSeek R1. However, this search behavior
is often imprecise and lacks confidence, resulting in long, redundant responses
and highlighting deficiencies in intuition and verification. Inspired by the
Dual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA
task that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within
a strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial
response; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more
deliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the
previous stage into precise steps. Our proposed task improves average accuracy
from 24.9% to 27.9% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 49.8% for
DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone
achieves 26.8% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial
inference efficiency gains. These findings suggest that intuition and
deliberative reasoning are distinct, complementary systems benefiting from
targeted training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域适应方法计算资源消耗大且存在幻觉问题，尤其在工程场景中需要高精度文本生成。

Method: 采用图结构设计，每个节点为小型专家模型，针对特定文本微调。

Result: SLG在Exact Match指标上优于传统方法3倍，微调速度快1.7倍。

Conclusion: SLG为中小型工程公司提供了经济高效的生成式AI解决方案，并可能推动分布式AI系统发展。

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in domain adaptation techniques for large
language models, these methods remain computationally intensive, and the
resulting models can still exhibit hallucination issues. Most existing
adaptation methods do not prioritize reducing the computational resources
required for fine-tuning and inference of language models. Hallucination issues
have gradually decreased with each new model release. However, they remain
prevalent in engineering contexts, where generating well-structured text with
minimal errors and inconsistencies is critical. This work introduces a novel
approach called the Small Language Graph (SLG), which is a lightweight
adaptation solution designed to address the two key challenges outlined above.
The system is structured in the form of a graph, where each node represents a
lightweight expert - a small language model fine-tuned on specific and concise
texts. The results of this study have shown that SLG was able to surpass
conventional fine-tuning methods on the Exact Match metric by 3 times.
Additionally, the fine-tuning process was 1.7 times faster compared to that of
a larger stand-alone language model. These findings introduce a potential for
small to medium-sized engineering companies to confidently use generative AI
technologies, such as LLMs, without the necessity to invest in expensive
computational resources. Also, the graph architecture and the small size of
expert nodes offer a possible opportunity for distributed AI systems, thus
potentially diverting the global need for expensive centralized compute
clusters.

Conclusion: EverGreenQA和EG-E5为LLMs处理时间性问题提供了有效工具，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate in question answering (QA)
tasks. A key yet underexplored factor contributing to this is the temporality
of questions -- whether they are evergreen (answers remain stable over time) or
mutable (answers change). In this work, we introduce EverGreenQA, the first
multilingual QA dataset with evergreen labels, supporting both evaluation and
training. Using EverGreenQA, we benchmark 12 modern LLMs to assess whether they
encode question temporality explicitly (via verbalized judgments) or implicitly
(via uncertainty signals). We also train EG-E5, a lightweight multilingual
classifier that achieves SoTA performance on this task. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical utility of evergreen classification across three applications:
improving self-knowledge estimation, filtering QA datasets, and explaining
GPT-4o retrieval behavior.

Motivation: 传统SGEC系统依赖级联模块，而端到端语音基础模型的兴起为SGEC和反馈生成提供了新思路。

Method: 采用伪标注扩展训练数据（从77小时到2500小时），并基于Whisper模型进行提示训练。

Result: 伪标注显著提升性能，提示训练对反馈生成效果更明显，但模型规模扩大未带来额外增益。

Conclusion: 端到端语音模型在SGEC中表现优异，提示训练和伪标注是有效的改进手段。

Abstract: Spoken Grammatical Error Correction (SGEC) and Feedback (SGECF) are crucial
for second language learners, teachers and test takers. Traditional SGEC
systems rely on a cascaded pipeline consisting of an ASR, a module for
disfluency detection (DD) and removal and one for GEC. With the rise of
end-to-end (E2E) speech foundation models, we investigate their effectiveness
in SGEC and feedback generation. This work introduces a pseudo-labelling
process to address the challenge of limited labelled data, expanding the
training data size from 77 hours to approximately 2500 hours, leading to
improved performance. Additionally, we prompt an E2E Whisper-based SGEC model
with fluent transcriptions, showing a slight improvement in SGEC performance,
with more significant gains in feedback generation. Finally, we assess the
impact of increasing model size, revealing that while pseudo-labelled data does
not yield performance gain for a larger Whisper model, training with prompts
proves beneficial.

Method: 预训练Data2vec2模型于30万小时无标签方言和口音语音数据，并在4万小时监督数据集上进行对齐训练，研究不同投影器和LLM对性能的影响。

Result: 方法在多个方言数据集（如Kespeech）上取得了SOTA结果。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练结合LLM能有效提升中文方言ASR性能，研究将开源以促进可复现性。

Abstract: Large-scale training corpora have significantly improved the performance of
ASR models. Unfortunately, due to the relative scarcity of data, Chinese
accents and dialects remain a challenge for most ASR models. Recent
advancements in self-supervised learning have shown that self-supervised pre-
training, combined with large language models (LLM), can effectively enhance
ASR performance in low-resource scenarios. We aim to investigate the
effectiveness of this paradigm for Chinese dialects. Specifically, we pre-train
a Data2vec2 model on 300,000 hours of unlabeled dialect and accented speech
data and do alignment training on a supervised dataset of 40,000 hours. Then,
we systematically examine the impact of various projectors and LLMs on
Mandarin, dialect, and accented speech recognition performance under this
paradigm. Our method achieved SOTA results on multiple dialect datasets,
including Kespeech. We will open-source our work to promote reproducible
research

Conclusion: 多模态LLMs在L2口语评分中具有潜力，其预训练的音频理解知识有助于提升泛化性能。

Abstract: The growing population of L2 English speakers has increased the demand for
developing automatic graders for spoken language assessment (SLA).
Historically, statistical models, text encoders, and self-supervised speech
models have been utilised for this task. However, cascaded systems suffer from
the loss of information, while E2E graders also have limitations. With the
recent advancements of multi-modal large language models (LLMs), we aim to
explore their potential as L2 oral proficiency graders and overcome these
issues. In this work, we compare various training strategies using regression
and classification targets. Our results show that speech LLMs outperform all
previous competitive baselines, achieving superior performance on two datasets.
Furthermore, the trained grader demonstrates strong generalisation capabilities
in the cross-part or cross-task evaluation, facilitated by the audio
understanding knowledge acquired during LLM pre-training.

Motivation: 多语言大模型的性能通常依赖于模型规模，而剪枝方法虽然能缩小模型规模，但往往伴随性能损失。因此，研究如何在稀疏化下保持多语言性能具有重要意义。

Method: 提出M-Wanda剪枝方法，利用语言感知的激活统计和动态调整层间稀疏度，优化剪枝策略以减少性能损失。

Result: 实验表明，M-Wanda能以最小成本显著提升多语言性能，尤其是在中等稀疏比例下。

Conclusion: M-Wanda是首个针对多语言性能优化的剪枝方法，为未来多语言剪枝研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multilingual LLM performance is often critically dependent on model size.
With an eye on efficiency, this has led to a surge in interest in one-shot
pruning methods that retain the benefits of large-scale pretraining while
shrinking the model size. However, as pruning tends to come with performance
loss, it is important to understand the trade-offs between multilinguality and
sparsification. In this work, we study multilingual performance under different
sparsity constraints and show that moderate ratios already substantially harm
performance. To help bridge this gap, we propose M-Wanda, a pruning method that
models cross-lingual variation by incorporating language-aware activation
statistics into its pruning criterion and dynamically adjusts layerwise
sparsity based on cross-lingual importance. We show that M-Wanda consistently
improves performance at minimal additional costs. We are the first to
explicitly optimize pruning to retain multilingual performance, and hope to
inspire future advances in multilingual pruning.

Abstract: Recently, deep reasoning large language models(LLMs) like DeepSeek-R1 have
made significant progress in tasks such as mathematics and coding. Inspired by
this, several studies have employed reinforcement learning(RL) to enhance
models' deep reasoning capabilities and improve machine translation(MT)
quality. However, the terminology translation, an essential task in MT, remains
unexplored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we propose \textbf{TAT-R1}, a
terminology-aware translation model trained with reinforcement learning and
word alignment. Specifically, we first extract the keyword translation pairs
using a word alignment model. Then we carefully design three types of
rule-based alignment rewards with the extracted alignment relationships. With
those alignment rewards, the RL-trained translation model can learn to focus on
the accurate translation of key information, including terminology in the
source text. Experimental results show the effectiveness of TAT-R1. Our model
significantly improves terminology translation accuracy compared to the
baseline models while maintaining comparable performance on general translation
tasks. In addition, we conduct detailed ablation studies of the
DeepSeek-R1-like training paradigm for machine translation and reveal several
key findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在长链式推理中存在过度思考现象，表现为冗余或重复的思维模式，影响推理效率和效果。

Method: 采用两阶段强化学习框架：第一阶段（GRPO++）通过更多训练步骤提升推理能力；第二阶段（L-GRPO）通过较少训练步骤强制简洁性。

Result: ConciseR在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，生成了更简洁的推理响应。

Conclusion: ConciseR有效解决了LLMs的过度思考问题，提升了推理的简洁性和效率。

Abstract: As test-time scaling becomes a pivotal research frontier in Large Language
Models (LLMs) development, contemporary and advanced post-training
methodologies increasingly focus on extending the generation length of long
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses to enhance reasoning capabilities toward
DeepSeek R1-like performance. However, recent studies reveal a persistent
overthinking phenomenon in state-of-the-art reasoning models, manifesting as
excessive redundancy or repetitive thinking patterns in long CoT responses. To
address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage
reinforcement learning framework for achieving concise reasoning in LLMs, named
ConciseR. Specifically, the first stage, using more training steps, aims to
incentivize the model's reasoning capabilities via Group Relative Policy
Optimization with clip-higher and dynamic sampling components (GRPO++), and the
second stage, using fewer training steps, explicitly enforces conciseness and
improves efficiency via Length-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization
(L-GRPO). Significantly, ConciseR only optimizes response length once all
rollouts of a sample are correct, following the "walk before you run"
principle. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ConciseR model,
which generates more concise CoT reasoning responses, outperforms recent
state-of-the-art reasoning models with zero RL paradigm across AIME 2024,
MATH-500, AMC 2023, Minerva, and Olympiad benchmarks.

surprisingly long texts - up to thousands of tokens - via autoregressive
generation from just one specially trained input embedding. In this work, we
explore whether such reconstruction is possible without autoregression. We show
that frozen LLMs can generate hundreds of accurate tokens in just one forward
pass, when provided with only two learned embeddings. This reveals a surprising
and underexplored capability of LLMs - multi-token generation without iterative
decoding. We investigate the behaviour of these embeddings and provide insight
into the type of information they encode. We also empirically show that
although these representations are not unique for a given text, they form
connected and local regions in embedding space - a property that suggests the
potential of learning a dedicated encoder into that space.

TLDR: LUNGUAGE是一个用于结构化放射学报告生成的基准数据集，支持单报告和多研究纵向评估，并提出了LUNGUAGESCORE评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法仅适用于单报告场景，且依赖粗粒度指标，无法捕捉细粒度临床语义和时间依赖性。

Method: 开发了一个两阶段框架，将生成的报告转换为结构化表示，并提出LUNGUAGESCORE评估指标。

Result: LUNGUAGE包含1,473份标注的胸部X光报告，80份具有纵向标注，LUNGUAGESCORE能有效评估结构化报告。

Conclusion: LUNGUAGE是首个支持序列放射学报告的基准数据集和评估指标，实证结果验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Radiology reports convey detailed clinical observations and capture
diagnostic reasoning that evolves over time. However, existing evaluation
methods are limited to single-report settings and rely on coarse metrics that
fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and temporal dependencies. We
introduce LUNGUAGE,a benchmark dataset for structured radiology report
generation that supports both single-report evaluation and longitudinal
patient-level assessment across multiple studies. It contains 1,473 annotated
chest X-ray reports, each reviewed by experts, and 80 of them contain
longitudinal annotations to capture disease progression and inter-study
intervals, also reviewed by experts. Using this benchmark, we develop a
two-stage framework that transforms generated reports into fine-grained,
schema-aligned structured representations, enabling longitudinal
interpretation. We also propose LUNGUAGESCORE, an interpretable metric that
compares structured outputs at the entity, relation, and attribute level while
modeling temporal consistency across patient timelines. These contributions
establish the first benchmark dataset, structuring framework, and evaluation
metric for sequential radiology reporting, with empirical results demonstrating
that LUNGUAGESCORE effectively supports structured report evaluation. The code

Motivation: 尽管微调显著提升了LLMs的指令跟随能力，但其背后的计算机制仍不明确。研究旨在揭示微调如何通过稀疏组件重新配置LLMs的计算。

Method: 研究使用HexaInst数据集，提出SPARCOM框架，包括识别稀疏组件、评估其功能通用性与独特性，并系统比较其变化。

Result: 实验证明了稀疏组件的功能通用性、独特性及其在指令执行中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解LLMs如何内化指令跟随行为提供了新视角，对可信赖LLM社区具有重要意义。

Abstract: The finetuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
their instruction-following capabilities, yet the underlying computational
mechanisms driving these improvements remain poorly understood. This study
systematically examines how fine-tuning reconfigures LLM computations by
isolating and analyzing instruction-specific sparse components, i.e., neurons
in dense models and both neurons and experts in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures. In particular, we introduce HexaInst, a carefully curated and
balanced instructional dataset spanning six distinct categories, and propose
SPARCOM, a novel analytical framework comprising three key contributions: (1) a
method for identifying these sparse components, (2) an evaluation of their
functional generality and uniqueness, and (3) a systematic comparison of their
alterations. Through experiments, we demonstrate functional generality,
uniqueness, and the critical role of these components in instruction execution.
By elucidating the relationship between fine-tuning-induced adaptations and
sparse computational substrates, this work provides deeper insights into how
LLMs internalize instruction-following behavior for the trustworthy LLM
community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在许多任务中表现出色，但仍存在幻觉问题，导致生成不准确文本。研究旨在探索LLM如何自然捕捉不确定性。

Method: 通过分析LLM潜在空间中的线性概念，研究其隐含的不确定性，并探讨不同类型不确定性的作用。

Result: 发现LLM能捕捉多种不确定性，且这些信息可用于预测任务正确性；模型缩放对捕捉不确定性影响不大。

Conclusion: 通过指令调优或[IDK]-token调优统一不确定性类型，有助于提升模型的正确性预测能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models are known to capture real-world knowledge, allowing
them to excel in many downstream tasks. Despite recent advances, these models
are still prone to what are commonly known as hallucinations, causing them to
emit unwanted and factually incorrect text. In this work, we study how well
LLMs capture uncertainty, without explicitly being trained for that. We show
that, if considering uncertainty as a linear concept in the model's latent
space, it might indeed be captured, even after only pretraining. We further
show that, though unintuitive, LLMs appear to capture several different types
of uncertainty, each of which can be useful to predict the correctness for a
specific task or benchmark. Furthermore, we provide in-depth results such as
demonstrating a correlation between our correction prediction and the model's
ability to abstain from misinformation using words, and the lack of impact of
model scaling for capturing uncertainty. Finally, we claim that unifying the
uncertainty types as a single one using instruction-tuning or [IDK]-token
tuning is helpful for the model in terms of correctness prediction.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究从模型表示角度探讨机器翻译的鲁棒性，通过分析模型对不合语法输入的内部表示及其演变，发现编码器先检测语法错误再修正，并识别出鲁棒性注意力头。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解鲁棒性对构建可靠NLP系统至关重要，但以往研究多关注失败案例或改进鲁棒性，本研究从模型表示角度填补空白。

Method: 采用语法错误检测（GED）探测和表示相似性分析，研究模型对不合语法输入的处理机制。

Result: 编码器先检测语法错误，再将表示修正为正确形式；识别出鲁棒性注意力头，其在处理语法错误时关注可解释语言单元。

Conclusion: 鲁棒性微调使模型更依赖鲁棒性注意力头修正不合语法词表示，为理解模型鲁棒性提供新视角。

Abstract: Understanding robustness is essential for building reliable NLP systems.
Unfortunately, in the context of machine translation, previous work mainly
focused on documenting robustness failures or improving robustness. In
contrast, we study robustness from a model representation perspective by
looking at internal model representations of ungrammatical inputs and how they
evolve through model layers. For this purpose, we perform Grammatical Error
Detection (GED) probing and representational similarity analysis. Our findings
indicate that the encoder first detects the grammatical error, then corrects it
by moving its representation toward the correct form. To understand what
contributes to this process, we turn to the attention mechanism where we
identify what we term Robustness Heads. We find that Robustness Heads attend to
interpretable linguistic units when responding to grammatical errors, and that
when we fine-tune models for robustness, they tend to rely more on Robustness
Heads for updating the ungrammatical word representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知诊断模型在冷启动场景下表现不佳，而现有NLP方法未能充分结合语义理解和认知分析。

Method: LMCD分两阶段：知识扩散（利用LLM生成练习和知识概念的丰富内容）和语义-认知融合（通过因果注意力机制整合文本信息与认知状态）。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上，LMCD在练习冷启动和领域冷启动场景中均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LMCD通过LLM有效解决了认知诊断中的冷启动问题，为个性化学习提供了更精准的评估。

Abstract: Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) has become a critical task in AI-empowered
education, supporting personalized learning by accurately assessing students'
cognitive states. However, traditional CD models often struggle in cold-start
scenarios due to the lack of student-exercise interaction data. Recent
NLP-based approaches leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown
promise by utilizing textual features but fail to fully bridge the gap between
semantic understanding and cognitive profiling. In this work, we propose
Language Models as Zeroshot Cognitive Diagnosis Learners (LMCD), a novel
framework designed to handle cold-start challenges by harnessing large language
models (LLMs). LMCD operates via two primary phases: (1) Knowledge Diffusion,
where LLMs generate enriched contents of exercises and knowledge concepts
(KCs), establishing stronger semantic links; and (2) Semantic-Cognitive Fusion,
where LLMs employ causal attention mechanisms to integrate textual information
and student cognitive states, creating comprehensive profiles for both students
and exercises. These representations are efficiently trained with off-the-shelf
CD models. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that LMCD
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both exercise-cold and
domain-cold settings. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 研究LLMs在医学文本摘要中的性能瓶颈，特别是在高OOV词或高新颖性数据上的表现，并提出词汇适应策略以优化性能。

Method: 通过词汇适应策略（如更新LLM词汇表）、持续预训练策略，并在三个医学摘要数据集上进行实验。

Result: 词汇适应显著提升了LLMs在困难设置下的摘要性能，且人类专家评估显示摘要更相关和忠实。

Conclusion: 词汇适应是优化LLMs在医学领域表现的有效方法，尤其在处理专业词汇时。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) recently achieved great success in medical text
summarization by simply using in-context learning. However, these recent
efforts do not perform fine-grained evaluations under difficult settings where
LLMs might fail. They typically report performance scores over the entire
dataset. Through our benchmarking study, we show that LLMs show a significant
performance drop for data points with high concentration of out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) words or with high novelty. Vocabulary adaptation is an intuitive
solution to this vocabulary mismatch issue where the LLM vocabulary gets
updated with certain expert domain (here, medical) words or subwords. An
interesting finding from our study is that Llama-3.1, even with a vocabulary
size of around 128K tokens, still faces over-fragmentation issue with medical
words. To that end, we show vocabulary adaptation helps improve the LLM
summarization performance even in difficult settings. Through extensive
experimentation of multiple vocabulary adaptation strategies, two continual
pretraining strategies, and three benchmark medical summarization datasets, we
gain valuable insights into the role of vocabulary adaptation strategies for
customizing LLMs to the medical domain. We also performed a human evaluation
study with medical experts where they found that vocabulary adaptation results
in more relevant and faithful summaries. Our codebase is made publicly
available at https://github.com/gb-kgp/LLM-MedicalSummarization-Benchmark.

Motivation: 多跳问答中，密集检索器需要标注的查询-文档对进行微调，但由于查询的高变异性，这成为挑战。

Method: ReSCORE利用大型语言模型捕捉文档与问题的相关性和答案一致性，在迭代问答框架中训练检索器。

Result: 在三个多跳问答基准测试中，ReSCORE显著提升了检索和问答性能。

Conclusion: ReSCORE为无需标注文档的多跳问答提供了一种有效解决方案，并取得了最新性能。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) involves reasoning across multiple
documents to answer complex questions. Dense retrievers typically outperform
sparse methods like BM25 by leveraging semantic embeddings; however, they
require labeled query-document pairs for fine-tuning. This poses a significant
challenge in MHQA due to the high variability of queries (reformulated)
questions throughout the reasoning steps. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce Retriever Supervision with Consistency and Relevance (ReSCORE), a
novel method for training dense retrievers for MHQA without labeled documents.
ReSCORE leverages large language models to capture each documents relevance to
the question and consistency with the correct answer and use them to train a
retriever within an iterative question-answering framework. Experiments on
three MHQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ReSCORE, with
significant improvements in retrieval, and in turn, the state-of-the-art MHQA
performance. Our implementation is available at:

Motivation: 探索像素语言模型在多语言预训练中的潜力，以支持更多样化的语言。

Method: 在四种视觉和语言多样化的语言（英语、印地语、乌克兰语、简体中文）上预训练PIXEL-M4模型。

Result: PIXEL-M4在语义和句法任务中表现优于单语言模型，并能捕捉未见过语言的丰富语言特征。

Conclusion: 多语言预训练显著提升了像素语言模型支持多样化语言的能力。

Abstract: Pixel language models operate directly on images of rendered text,
eliminating the need for a fixed vocabulary. While these models have
demonstrated strong capabilities for downstream cross-lingual transfer,
multilingual pretraining remains underexplored. We introduce PIXEL-M4, a model
pretrained on four visually and linguistically diverse languages: English,
Hindi, Ukrainian, and Simplified Chinese. Multilingual evaluations on semantic
and syntactic tasks show that PIXEL-M4 outperforms an English-only counterpart
on non-Latin scripts. Word-level probing analyses confirm that PIXEL-M4
captures rich linguistic features, even in languages not seen during
pretraining. Furthermore, an analysis of its hidden representations shows that
multilingual pretraining yields a semantic embedding space closely aligned
across the languages used for pretraining. This work demonstrates that
multilingual pretraining substantially enhances the capability of pixel
language models to effectively support a diverse set of languages.

Motivation: 现有高难度代码数据集的稀缺限制了LLM代码推理能力的提升，尤其是缺乏可验证的输入输出测试用例。

Method: 1) 合成新的可解编程问题；2) 引入输入输出测试用例合成管道；3) 为问题添加高质量的长推理解决方案。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，rStar-Coder显著提升了模型性能，如Qwen2.5-7B从17.4%提升至57.3%。

Conclusion: rStar-Coder通过高质量数据集和验证机制，为LLM代码推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Advancing code reasoning in large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally
limited by the scarcity of high-difficulty datasets, especially those with
verifiable input-output test cases necessary for rigorous solution validation
at scale. We introduce rStar-Coder, which significantly improves LLM code
reasoning capabilities by constructing a large-scale, verified dataset of 418K
competition-level code problems, 580K long-reasoning solutions along with rich
test cases of varying difficulty. This is achieved through three core
contributions: (1) we curate competitive programming code problems and oracle
solutions to synthesize new, solvable problems; (2) we introduce a reliable
input-output test case synthesis pipeline that decouples the generation into a
three-step input generation method and a mutual verification mechanism for
effective output labeling; (3) we augment problems with high-quality,
test-case-verified long-reasoning solutions. Extensive experiments on Qwen
models (1.5B-14B) across various code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of rStar-Coder dataset, achieving leading performance comparable to
frontier reasoning LLMs with much smaller model sizes. On LiveCodeBench,
rStar-Coder improves Qwen2.5-7B from 17.4% to an impressive 57.3%, and
Qwen2.5-14B from 23.3% to 62.5%, surpassing o3-mini (low) by3.1%. On the more
challenging USA Computing Olympiad, our 7B model achieves an average pass@1
accuracy of 16.15%, outperforming the frontier-level QWQ-32B. Code and the
dataset will be released at https://github.com/microsoft/rStar.

Result: 人类与AI在分类任务中一致性较低，但AI在不同语义领域表现差异显著。

Conclusion: AI生成的下级类别在心理学和语言学研究中具有潜力，但仍存在局限性。

Abstract: People can categorize the same entity at multiple taxonomic levels, such as
basic (bear), superordinate (animal), and subordinate (grizzly bear). While
prior research has focused on basic-level categories, this study is the first
attempt to examine the organization of categories by analyzing exemplars
produced at the subordinate level. We present a new Italian psycholinguistic
dataset of human-generated exemplars for 187 concrete words. We then use these
data to evaluate whether textual and vision LLMs produce meaningful exemplars
that align with human category organization across three key tasks: exemplar
generation, category induction, and typicality judgment. Our findings show a
low alignment between humans and LLMs, consistent with previous studies.
However, their performance varies notably across different semantic domains.
Ultimately, this study highlights both the promises and the constraints of
using AI-generated exemplars to support psychological and linguistic research.

Abstract: With over 2,000 languages and potentially millions of speakers, Africa
represents one of the richest linguistic regions in the world. Yet, this
diversity is scarcely reflected in state-of-the-art natural language processing
(NLP) systems and large language models (LLMs), which predominantly support a
narrow set of high-resource languages. This exclusion not only limits the reach
and utility of modern NLP technologies but also risks widening the digital
divide across linguistic communities. Nevertheless, NLP research on African
languages is active and growing. In recent years, there has been a surge of
interest in this area, driven by several factors-including the creation of
multilingual language resources, the rise of community-led initiatives, and
increased support through funding programs. In this survey, we analyze 734
research papers on NLP for African languages published over the past five
years, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress across core tasks.
We identify key trends shaping the field and conclude by outlining promising
directions to foster more inclusive and sustainable NLP research for African
languages.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）发展迅速，但其与传统监督机器学习技术在医学数据（尤其是精神病学领域）的结合仍未被充分探索。

Method: 集成LLaMA3（捕捉长程语义结构）、RoBERTa（基于临床叙述微调）和SVM（基于TF-IDF特征），通过多数投票机制聚合模型。

Result: 集成模型优于单一模型，F1分数为0.71，召回率提升且保持高精度。

Conclusion: 混合架构结合LLMs的语义丰富性和传统ML的可解释性，为精神病学文本分类提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), their integration
with traditional supervised machine learning (ML) techniques that have proven
applicability to medical data remains underexplored. This is particularly true
for psychiatric applications, where narrative data often exhibit nuanced
linguistic and contextual complexity, and can benefit from the combination of
multiple models with differing characteristics. In this study, we introduce an
ensemble framework for automatically classifying
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis (binary) using
narrative transcripts. Our approach integrates three complementary models:
LLaMA3, an open-source LLM that captures long-range semantic structure;
RoBERTa, a pre-trained transformer model fine-tuned on labeled clinical
narratives; and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained using
TF-IDF-based lexical features. These models are aggregated through a majority
voting mechanism to enhance predictive robustness. The dataset includes 441
instances, including 352 for training and 89 for validation. Empirical results
show that the ensemble outperforms individual models, achieving an F$_1$ score
of 0.71 (95\% CI: [0.60-0.80]). Compared to the best-performing individual
model (SVM), the ensemble improved recall while maintaining competitive
precision. This indicates the strong sensitivity of the ensemble in identifying
ADHD-related linguistic cues. These findings demonstrate the promise of hybrid
architectures that leverage the semantic richness of LLMs alongside the
interpretability and pattern recognition capabilities of traditional supervised
ML, offering a new direction for robust and generalizable psychiatric text
classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专利权利要求中的模糊性（indefiniteness）是专利申请被拒的常见原因，但目前缺乏相关标注数据集，阻碍了自动检测方法的发展。

Method: 构建了PEDANTIC数据集，通过自动流程从USPTO获取文件，利用LLM提取模糊性原因，并进行人工验证。还采用LLM-as-Judge方法评估模型表现。

Result: LLM模型（如Qwen 2.5 32B和72B）在模糊性预测上表现不佳，但能正确识别原因。数据集为专利AI研究提供了资源。

Conclusion: PEDANTIC是首个针对专利模糊性的标注数据集，支持开发更高效的专利审查模型，并将公开数据和代码。

Abstract: Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention. If there are
ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office. In the US, this is
referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C {\S} 112(b)) and is among the most
frequent reasons for patent application rejection. The development of automatic
methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent
drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been
published to date.
  We introduce PEDANTIC (\underline{P}at\underline{e}nt
\underline{D}efiniteness Ex\underline{a}mi\underline{n}a\underline{ti}on
\underline{C}orpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent
applications relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with
reasons for indefiniteness. We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic
pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness. A human
validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality
annotations. To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement
an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every
model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason. We show that LLM agents
based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression
baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify
the underlying reasons. PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI
researchers, enabling the development of advanced examination models. We will
publicly release the dataset and code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于孟加拉语资源匮乏且需要多步推理，现有模型难以处理复杂的孟加拉语MWPs。缺乏高质量数据集限制了该领域的发展。

Method: 创建了包含8792道复杂孟加拉语MWPs的SOMADHAN数据集，并评估了多种LLMs（如GPT-4o、LLaMA等）在零样本和少样本提示下的性能，结合Chain of Thought（CoT）推理。

Result: CoT提示显著提升了模型性能，LLaMA-3.3 70B在少样本CoT提示下达到88%的准确率。通过LoRA微调，模型能以低成本适应任务。

Conclusion: 研究填补了孟加拉语NLP的空白，提供了高质量数据集和可扩展框架，推动了低资源语言的公平研究和教育技术发展。

Abstract: Solving Bengali Math Word Problems (MWPs) remains a major challenge in
natural language processing (NLP) due to the language's low-resource status and
the multi-step reasoning required. Existing models struggle with complex
Bengali MWPs, largely because no human-annotated Bengali dataset has previously
addressed this task. This gap has limited progress in Bengali mathematical
reasoning. To address this, we created SOMADHAN, a dataset of 8792 complex
Bengali MWPs with manually written, step-by-step solutions. We designed this
dataset to support reasoning-focused evaluation and model development in a
linguistically underrepresented context. Using SOMADHAN, we evaluated a range
of large language models (LLMs) - including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA series
models, Deepseek, and Qwen - through both zero-shot and few-shot prompting with
and without Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. CoT prompting consistently
improved performance over standard prompting, especially in tasks requiring
multi-step logic. LLaMA-3.3 70B achieved the highest accuracy of 88% with
few-shot CoT prompting. We also applied Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune
models efficiently, enabling them to adapt to Bengali MWPs with minimal
computational cost. Our work fills a critical gap in Bengali NLP by providing a
high-quality reasoning dataset and a scalable framework for solving complex
MWPs. We aim to advance equitable research in low-resource languages and

### [122] [Evaluating LLM Adaptation to Sociodemographic Factors: User Profile vs. Dialogue History](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21362)
*Qishuai Zhong,Zongmin Li,Siqi Fan,Aixin Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLM）在用户社会人口特征（如年龄、职业、教育水平）下行为适应性的框架，通过显式用户配置文件或隐式多轮对话历史引入特征，并评估模型行为的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估多关注单轮提示，而实际应用中需基于对话历史进行上下文适应，因此需研究LLM在多轮对话中的行为适应性。

Method: 采用多代理流程构建合成数据集，结合用户配置文件和对话历史，使用VSM 2013问题探测模型的价值表达。

Result: 大多数模型会根据人口特征（尤其是年龄和教育水平）调整表达价值，但一致性不一；推理能力强的模型表现更一致。

Conclusion: 推理能力对LLM的社会人口适应性至关重要，未来研究可进一步优化模型在多轮对话中的行为一致性。

Abstract: Effective engagement by large language models (LLMs) requires adapting
responses to users' sociodemographic characteristics, such as age, occupation,
and education level. While many real-world applications leverage dialogue
history for contextualization, existing evaluations of LLMs' behavioral
adaptation often focus on single-turn prompts. In this paper, we propose a
framework to evaluate LLM adaptation when attributes are introduced either (1)
explicitly via user profiles in the prompt or (2) implicitly through multi-turn
dialogue history. We assess the consistency of model behavior across these
modalities. Using a multi-agent pipeline, we construct a synthetic dataset
pairing dialogue histories with distinct user profiles and employ questions
from the Value Survey Module (VSM 2013) (Hofstede and Hofstede, 2016) to probe
value expression. Our findings indicate that most models adjust their expressed
values in response to demographic changes, particularly in age and education
level, but consistency varies. Models with stronger reasoning capabilities
demonstrate greater alignment, indicating the importance of reasoning in robust
sociodemographic adaptation.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究探讨了LLM在文本修订中对性别角色名词的修改及其理由，评估其是否符合女权主义和跨性别包容的语言改革，并发现LLM对上下文效应的敏感性与人类相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在性别角色名词修订中的行为及其理由，以评估其是否符合女权主义和跨性别包容的语言改革标准。

Method: 通过分析LLM对性别角色名词的修订及其理由，结合社会语言学视角，评估其与语言改革的契合度及对上下文效应的敏感性。

Result: 研究发现LLM在性别角色名词修订中表现出与人类相似的上下文敏感性，并广泛支持女权主义和跨性别包容的语言改革。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明LLM在性别语言修订中具有价值对齐的潜力，但也需进一步探讨其实际应用中的伦理和效果。

Abstract: Within the common LLM use case of text revision, we study LLMs' revision of
gendered role nouns (e.g., outdoorsperson/woman/man) and their justifications
of such revisions. We evaluate their alignment with feminist and
trans-inclusive language reforms for English. Drawing on insight from
sociolinguistics, we further assess if LLMs are sensitive to the same
contextual effects in the application of such reforms as people are, finding
broad evidence of such effects. We discuss implications for value alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出两种方法（PHISH和MESH）以应对韩语中通过语音替换规避仇恨言论检测的问题，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意用户利用语音替换规避检测，现有研究忽视韩语且缺乏架构级防御。

Method: 提出PHISH（利用韩语语音特性）和MESH（在架构中融入语音信息）。

Result: 实验显示方法在扰动和未扰动数据集上均有效。

Conclusion: 方法提升检测性能并反映真实对抗行为。

Abstract: As malicious users increasingly employ phonetic substitution to evade hate
speech detection, researchers have investigated such strategies. However, two
key challenges remain. First, existing studies have overlooked the Korean
language, despite its vulnerability to phonetic perturbations due to its
phonographic nature. Second, prior work has primarily focused on constructing
datasets rather than developing architectural defenses. To address these
challenges, we propose (1) PHonetic-Informed Substitution for Hangul (PHISH)
that exploits the phonological characteristics of the Korean writing system,
and (2) Mixed Encoding of Semantic-pHonetic features (MESH) that enhances the
detector's robustness by incorporating phonetic information at the
architectural level. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methods on both perturbed and unperturbed datasets, suggesting
that they not only improve detection performance but also reflect realistic
adversarial behaviors employed by malicious users.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: AutoJudger是一个基于代理的框架，通过动态选择最具信息量的测试问题，显著降低多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）评估成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态基准的规模和复杂性增加，评估MLLMs的成本越来越高，需要高效解决方案。

Method: AutoJudger结合项目反应理论（IRT）和自主评估代理，动态选择问题，并包含语义感知检索和动态记忆机制。

Result: 在四个多模态基准上的实验表明，AutoJudger仅用4%的数据即可实现90%以上的排名准确性。

Conclusion: AutoJudger显著降低了评估成本，同时保持了高准确性。

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is increasingly
expensive, as the growing size and cross-modality complexity of benchmarks
demand significant scoring efforts. To tackle with this difficulty, we
introduce AutoJudger, an agent-driven framework for efficient and adaptive
benchmarking of MLLMs that tackles this escalating cost. AutoJudger employs the
Item Response Theory (IRT) to estimate the question difficulty and an
autonomous evaluation agent to dynamically select the most informative test
questions based on the model's real-time performance. Specifically, AutoJudger
incorporates two pivotal components: a semantic-aware retrieval mechanism to
ensure that selected questions cover diverse and challenging scenarios across
both vision and language modalities, and a dynamic memory that maintains
contextual statistics of previously evaluated questions to guide coherent and
globally informed question selection throughout the evaluation process.
Extensive experiments on four representative multimodal benchmarks demonstrate
that our adaptive framework dramatically reduces evaluation expenses, i.e.
AutoJudger uses only 4% of the data to achieve over 90% ranking accuracy with
the full benchmark evaluation on MMT-Bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM生成的研究想法常面临可行性和有效性不足的问题，需要数据支持以提升质量。

Method: 引入两种数据增强方式：1）在生成阶段提供元数据引导可行性方向；2）在筛选阶段自动验证假设的合理性。实验基于社会科学领域的气候谈判主题。

Result: 元数据使生成想法的可行性提高20%，自动验证使筛选想法质量提升7%。人类研究表明，数据辅助的LLM想法能启发更高质量的研究提案。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的LLM辅助研究想法生成具有实际应用潜力，尤其在学术场景中。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
generating novel research ideas. However, these ideas often face challenges
related to feasibility and expected effectiveness. This paper explores how
augmenting LLMs with relevant data during the idea generation process can
enhance the quality of generated ideas. We introduce two ways of incorporating
data: (1) providing metadata during the idea generation stage to guide LLMs
toward feasible directions, and (2) adding automatic validation during the idea
selection stage to assess the empirical plausibility of hypotheses within
ideas. We conduct experiments in the social science domain, specifically with
climate negotiation topics, and find that metadata improves the feasibility of
generated ideas by 20%, while automatic validation improves the overall quality
of selected ideas by 7%. A human study shows that LLM-generated ideas, along
with their related data and validation processes, inspire researchers to
propose research ideas with higher quality. Our work highlights the potential
of data-driven research idea generation, and underscores the practical utility
of LLM-assisted ideation in real-world academic settings.

TLDR: 提出DecisionFlow框架，通过结构化推理提升语言模型在高风险决策中的透明性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在高风险领域（如医疗和金融）的决策缺乏透明性和结构化推理，需要改进。

Method: DecisionFlow框架通过构建语义化的决策空间和潜在效用函数，透明地评估权衡。

Result: 在两个高风险基准测试中，DecisionFlow比基线方法准确率提升30%，且结果更一致。

Conclusion: DecisionFlow是结合符号推理与LLM的关键一步，提升决策系统的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: In high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance, effective
decision-making demands not just accurate outcomes but transparent and
explainable reasoning. However, current language models often lack the
structured deliberation needed for such tasks, instead generating decisions and
justifications in a disconnected, post-hoc manner. To address this, we propose
DecisionFlow, a novel decision modeling framework that guides models to reason
over structured representations of actions, attributes, and constraints. Rather
than predicting answers directly from prompts, DecisionFlow builds a
semantically grounded decision space and infers a latent utility function to
evaluate trade-offs in a transparent, utility-driven manner. This process
produces decisions tightly coupled with interpretable rationales reflecting the
model's reasoning. Empirical results on two high-stakes benchmarks show that
DecisionFlow not only achieves up to 30% accuracy gains over strong prompting
baselines but also enhances alignment in outcomes. Our work is a critical step
toward integrating symbolic reasoning with LLMs, enabling more accountable,
explainable, and reliable LLM decision support systems. We release the data and
code at https://github.com/xiusic/DecisionFlow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs生成内容中事实错误的问题，探索其内在的自我监控机制。

Method: 通过分析Transformer残差流中的线性特征，研究LLMs在不同上下文扰动下的表现，并进行模型规模和训练动态的扩展实验。

Result: LLMs在生成时能通过内部特征判断事实正确性，且这种能力在训练中快速出现并在中间层达到峰值。

Conclusion: LLMs具有内在的自我监控能力，增强了其可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Factual incorrectness in generated content is one of the primary concerns in
ubiquitous deployment of large language models (LLMs). Prior findings suggest
LLMs can (sometimes) detect factual incorrectness in their generated content
(i.e., fact-checking post-generation). In this work, we provide evidence
supporting the presence of LLMs' internal compass that dictate the correctness
of factual recall at the time of generation. We demonstrate that for a given
subject entity and a relation, LLMs internally encode linear features in the
Transformer's residual stream that dictate whether it will be able to recall
the correct attribute (that forms a valid entity-relation-attribute triplet).
This self-awareness signal is robust to minor formatting variations. We
investigate the effects of context perturbation via different example selection
strategies. Scaling experiments across model sizes and training dynamics
highlight that self-awareness emerges rapidly during training and peaks in
intermediate layers. These findings uncover intrinsic self-monitoring
capabilities within LLMs, contributing to their interpretability and
reliability.

TLDR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成结构化表格输出时的准确性挑战，并提出了新基准RelationalFactQA用于评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多关注简短事实回答，忽略了生成结构化表格输出的能力，而这一能力在实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 引入RelationalFactQA基准，包含多样化自然语言问题（与SQL配对）和标准表格答案，用于评估LLMs在结构化知识检索中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的LLMs在生成关系型输出时准确率不超过25%，且随着输出维度增加性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在结构化知识合成中的关键局限，RelationalFactQA为未来LLM事实性评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Factuality in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a persistent challenge. Current
benchmarks often assess short factual answers, overlooking the critical ability
to generate structured, multi-record tabular outputs from parametric knowledge.
We demonstrate that this relational fact retrieval is substantially more
difficult than isolated point-wise queries, even when individual facts are
known to the model, exposing distinct failure modes sensitive to output
dimensionality (e.g., number of attributes or records). To systematically
evaluate this under-explored capability, we introduce RelationalFactQA, a new
benchmark featuring diverse natural language questions (paired with SQL) and
gold-standard tabular answers, specifically designed to assess knowledge
retrieval in a structured format. RelationalFactQA enables analysis across
varying query complexities, output sizes, and data characteristics. Our
experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle significantly, not
exceeding 25% factual accuracy in generating relational outputs, with
performance notably degrading as output dimensionality increases. These
findings underscore critical limitations in current LLMs' ability to synthesize
structured factual knowledge and establish RelationalFactQA as a crucial
resource for measuring future progress in LLM factuality.

TLDR: MoGE（分组专家混合）通过分组和平衡专家负载，解决了MoE（专家混合）中专家激活不均衡的问题，显著提升了Ascend NPU上的训练和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE中专家激活不均衡导致系统效率低下，尤其是在多设备并行运行时。

Method: 提出MoGE，通过分组约束专家激活，平衡负载，并构建了Pangu Pro MoE模型。

Result: MoGE显著提升了负载均衡和效率，Pangu Pro MoE在Ascend NPU上表现出色，推理速度达1148-1528 tokens/s。

Conclusion: MoGE和Ascend NPU的结合为大规模稀疏模型提供了高效解决方案，性能优于同类模型。

Abstract: The surgence of Mixture of Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models promises a
small price of execution cost for a much larger model parameter count and
learning capacity, because only a small fraction of parameters are activated
for each input token. However, it is commonly observed that some experts are
activated far more often than others, leading to system inefficiency when
running the experts on different devices in parallel. Therefore, we introduce
Mixture of Grouped Experts (MoGE), which groups the experts during selection
and balances the expert workload better than MoE in nature. It constrains
tokens to activate an equal number of experts within each predefined expert
group. When a model execution is distributed on multiple devices, this
architectural design ensures a balanced computational load across devices,
significantly enhancing throughput, particularly for the inference phase.
Further, we build Pangu Pro MoE on Ascend NPUs, a sparse model based on MoGE
with 72 billion total parameters, 16 billion of which are activated for each
token. The configuration of Pangu Pro MoE is optimized for Ascend 300I Duo and
800I A2 through extensive system simulation studies. Our experiments indicate
that MoGE indeed leads to better expert load balancing and more efficient
execution for both model training and inference on Ascend NPUs. The inference
performance of Pangu Pro MoE achieves 1148 tokens/s per card and can be further
improved to 1528 tokens/s per card by speculative acceleration, outperforming
comparable 32B and 72B Dense models. Furthermore, we achieve an excellent
cost-to-performance ratio for model inference on Ascend 300I Duo.Our studies
show that Ascend NPUs are capable of training Pangu Pro MoE with massive
parallelization to make it a leading model within the sub-100B total parameter
class, outperforming prominent open-source models like GLM-Z1-32B and
Qwen3-32B.

TLDR: RefTool是一个参考引导的框架，通过利用外部结构化材料（如教科书）自动创建工具，解决了LLMs在无预定义工具任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖LLMs的内部知识，无法处理超出其知识范围的任务，因此需要一种能够利用外部参考的工具创建方法。

Method: RefTool包含两个模块：工具创建（生成、验证和组织工具）和工具利用（选择和应用工具）。

Result: 实验表明，RefTool在多个领域的基准测试中平均准确率提升11.3%，且成本高效、通用性强。

Conclusion: RefTool通过外部参考和层次化结构，显著提升了LLMs的推理能力，克服了知识限制。

Abstract: Tools enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex problem-solving tasks, but not all tasks have available tools. In the
absence of predefined tools, prior works have explored instructing LLMs to
generate tools on their own. However, such approaches rely heavily on the
models' internal knowledge and would fail in domains beyond the LLMs' knowledge
scope. To address this limitation, we propose RefTool, a reference-guided
framework for automatic tool creation that leverages structured external
materials such as textbooks. RefTool consists of two modules: (1) tool
creation, where LLMs generate executable tools from reference content, validate
them using illustrative examples, and organize them hierarchically into a
toolbox; and (2) tool utilization, where LLMs navigate the toolbox structure to
select and apply the appropriate tools to solve problems. Experiments on
causality, physics, and chemistry benchmarks demonstrate that RefTool
outperforms existing tool-creation and domain-specific reasoning methods by
11.3% on average accuracy, while being cost-efficient and broadly
generalizable. Analyses reveal that grounding tool creation in references
produces accurate and faithful tools, and that the hierarchical structure
facilitates effective tool selection. RefTool enables LLMs to overcome
knowledge limitations, demonstrating the value of grounding tool creation in
external references for enhanced and generalizable reasoning.

Motivation: 传统IR模型仅基于标准<查询,段落>对训练，难以有效理解和遵循明确的用户指令。

Method: InF-IR生成38,000个表达性三元组，并通过污染指令和查询生成硬负样本，利用高级推理模型验证语义合理性。训练InF-Embed模型，采用对比学习和指令-查询注意力机制。

Result: 在五个指令检索基准测试中，InF-Embed的p-MRR显著优于基线8.1%。

Conclusion: InF-IR语料库和InF-Embed模型显著提升了指令跟随IR的性能，为直接嵌入检索提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern information retrieval (IR) models, trained exclusively on standard
<query, passage> pairs, struggle to effectively interpret and follow explicit
user instructions. We introduce InF-IR, a large-scale, high-quality training
corpus tailored for enhancing retrieval models in Instruction-Following IR.
InF-IR expands traditional training pairs into over 38,000 expressive
<instruction, query, passage> triplets as positive samples. In particular, for
each positive triplet, we generate two additional hard negative examples by
poisoning both instructions and queries, then rigorously validated by an
advanced reasoning model (o3-mini) to ensure semantic plausibility while
maintaining instructional incorrectness. Unlike existing corpora that primarily
support computationally intensive reranking tasks for decoder-only language
models, the highly contrastive positive-negative triplets in InF-IR further
enable efficient representation learning for smaller encoder-only models,
facilitating direct embedding-based retrieval. Using this corpus, we train
InF-Embed, an instruction-aware Embedding model optimized through contrastive
learning and instruction-query attention mechanisms to align retrieval outcomes
precisely with user intents. Extensive experiments across five
instruction-based retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that InF-Embed significantly
surpasses competitive baselines by 8.1% in p-MRR, measuring the
instruction-following capabilities.

Motivation: 现有NLP研究将冲突检测视为通用任务，忽略了关系动态对感知的影响，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用非暴力沟通理论评估LLMs，创建PersonaConflicts数据集，并通过人类标注研究关系背景的影响。

Result: 关系背景显著改变人类对冲突的感知，但模型难以利用这些信息，且高估消息的积极影响。

Conclusion: 个性化关系背景对LLMs作为有效沟通中介至关重要。

Abstract: Conversational breakdowns in close relationships are deeply shaped by
personal histories and emotional context, yet most NLP research treats conflict
detection as a general task, overlooking the relational dynamics that influence
how messages are perceived. In this work, we leverage nonviolent communication
(NVC) theory to evaluate LLMs in detecting conversational breakdowns and
assessing how relationship backstory influences both human and model perception
of conflicts. Given the sensitivity and scarcity of real-world datasets
featuring conflict between familiar social partners with rich personal
backstories, we contribute the PersonaConflicts Corpus, a dataset of N=5,772
naturalistic simulated dialogues spanning diverse conflict scenarios between
friends, family members, and romantic partners. Through a controlled human
study, we annotate a subset of dialogues and obtain fine-grained labels of
communication breakdown types on individual turns, and assess the impact of
backstory on human and model perception of conflict in conversation. We find
that the polarity of relationship backstories significantly shifted human
perception of communication breakdowns and impressions of the social partners,
yet models struggle to meaningfully leverage those backstories in the detection
task. Additionally, we find that models consistently overestimate how
positively a message will make a listener feel. Our findings underscore the
critical role of personalization to relationship contexts in enabling LLMs to
serve as effective mediators in human communication for authentic connection.

Result: 实验表明，潜在语言一致性并非总是对任务表现至关重要，因为模型会在最终层调整内部表示以适应目标语言。

Conclusion: 潜在语言一致性对任务表现的影响有限，模型能够通过调整内部表示适应目标语言。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to process information using a
proficient internal language consistently, referred to as latent language,
which may differ from the input or output languages. However, how the
discrepancy between the latent language and the input and output language
affects downstream task performance remains largely unexplored. While many
studies research the latent language of LLMs, few address its importance in
influencing task performance. In our study, we hypothesize that thinking in
latent language consistently enhances downstream task performance. To validate
this, our work varies the input prompt languages across multiple downstream
tasks and analyzes the correlation between consistency in latent language and
task performance. We create datasets consisting of questions from diverse
domains such as translation and geo-culture, which are influenced by the choice
of latent language. Experimental results across multiple LLMs on translation
and geo-culture tasks, which are sensitive to the choice of language, indicate
that maintaining consistency in latent language is not always necessary for
optimal downstream task performance. This is because these models adapt their
internal representations near the final layers to match the target language,
reducing the impact of consistency on overall performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型虽具并行生成和双向性优势，但推理速度慢且存在token不连贯问题，限制了其应用。

Result: 在开源推理基准测试中，方法组合实现34倍端到端加速，且准确性未受影响。

Conclusion: 首次使扩散语言模型在延迟上与自回归模型相当甚至更快，为其广泛应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Diffusion language models offer parallel token generation and inherent
bidirectionality, promising more efficient and powerful sequence modeling
compared to autoregressive approaches. However, state-of-the-art diffusion
models (e.g., Dream 7B, LLaDA 8B) suffer from slow inference. While they match
the quality of similarly sized Autoregressive (AR) Models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B,
Llama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward
passes, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for
long input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token
generation introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling
heuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising
steps. We address these limitations with two training-free techniques. First,
we propose FreeCache, a Key-Value (KV) approximation caching technique that
reuses stable KV projections across denoising steps, effectively reducing the
computational cost of DLM inference. Second, we introduce Guided Diffusion, a
training-free method that uses a lightweight pretrained autoregressive model to
supervise token unmasking, dramatically reducing the total number of denoising
iterations without sacrificing quality. We conduct extensive evaluations on
open-source reasoning benchmarks, and our combined methods deliver up to a 34x
end-to-end speedup without compromising accuracy. For the first time, diffusion
language models achieve a comparable and even faster latency as the widely
adopted autoregressive models. Our work successfully paved the way for scaling
up the diffusion language model to a broader scope of applications across
different domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的上下文窗口限制阻碍了外部知识输入的扩展，影响了复杂任务的性能提升。

Result: 在∞Bench+等测试集上表现优异，性能显著提升且保持高效率。

Conclusion: ExtAgents为处理大规模外部知识输入提供了有效解决方案，未来研究可进一步优化智能体协调。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of post-training techniques for reasoning and
information seeking, large language models (LLMs) can incorporate a large
quantity of retrieved knowledge to solve complex tasks. However, the limited
context window of LLMs obstructs scaling the amount of external knowledge
input, prohibiting further improvement, especially for tasks requiring
significant amount of external knowledge. Existing context window extension
methods inevitably cause information loss. LLM-based multi-agent methods emerge
as a new paradigm to handle massive input in a distributional manner, where we
identify two core bottlenecks in existing knowledge synchronization and
reasoning processes. In this work, we develop a multi-agent framework,
$\textbf{ExtAgents}$, to overcome the bottlenecks and enable better scalability
in inference-time knowledge integration without longer-context training.
Benchmarked with our enhanced multi-hop question answering test,
$\textbf{$\boldsymbol{\infty}$Bench+}$, and other public test sets including
long survey generation, ExtAgents significantly enhances the performance over
existing non-training methods with the same amount of external knowledge input,
regardless of whether it falls $\textit{within or exceeds the context window}$.
Moreover, the method maintains high efficiency due to high parallelism. Further
study in the coordination of LLM agents on increasing external knowledge input
could benefit real-world applications.

TLDR: 论文通过大规模分析大型语言模型（LLMs）的道德推理痕迹，揭示其在伦理复杂场景中的处理方式，发现LLMs倾向于基于义务论原则，而事后解释则转向功利主义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在医疗、法律和治理中的应用增加，理解其如何处理伦理复杂场景变得至关重要。此前研究主要关注LLMs的道德判断而非推理过程。

Method: 研究利用600多个电车问题作为探针，分析LLMs的道德推理痕迹，并引入分类法系统化其推理模式。

Result: LLMs的思维链倾向于义务论原则，而事后解释则更偏向功利主义。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解LLMs如何处理和表达伦理考量提供了基础，有助于其在高风险决策环境中的安全和可解释部署。

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly navigate applications in healthcare, law, and
governance, understanding how they handle ethically complex scenarios becomes
critical. Previous work has mainly examined the moral judgments in large
language models (LLMs), rather than their underlying moral reasoning process.
In contrast, we focus on a large-scale analysis of the moral reasoning traces
provided by LLMs. Furthermore, unlike prior work that attempted to draw
inferences from only a handful of moral dilemmas, our study leverages over 600
distinct trolley problems as probes for revealing the reasoning patterns that
emerge within different LLMs. We introduce and test a taxonomy of moral
rationales to systematically classify reasoning traces according to two main
normative ethical theories: consequentialism and deontology. Our analysis
reveals that LLM chains-of-thought tend to favor deontological principles based
on moral obligations, while post-hoc explanations shift notably toward
consequentialist rationales that emphasize utility. Our framework provides a
foundation for understanding how LLMs process and articulate ethical
considerations, an important step toward safe and interpretable deployment of
LLMs in high-stakes decision-making environments. Our code is available at

TLDR: UI-Genie是一个自改进框架，通过奖励模型和数据生成策略解决GUI代理中的轨迹验证和高质量训练数据不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GUI代理中轨迹验证困难和高质量训练数据难以扩展的挑战。

Method: 采用图像-文本交错架构的奖励模型（UI-Genie-RM）和自改进管道，结合规则验证、轨迹破坏和硬负样本挖掘生成数据。

Result: UI-Genie在多个GUI代理基准测试中达到最先进性能，并通过三阶段数据模型自改进验证其有效性。

Conclusion: UI-Genie框架开源，为GUI代理研究提供了高质量数据集和工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce UI-Genie, a self-improving framework addressing
two key challenges in GUI agents: verification of trajectory outcome is
challenging and high-quality training data are not scalable. These challenges
are addressed by a reward model and a self-improving pipeline, respectively.
The reward model, UI-Genie-RM, features an image-text interleaved architecture
that efficiently pro- cesses historical context and unifies action-level and
task-level rewards. To sup- port the training of UI-Genie-RM, we develop
deliberately-designed data genera- tion strategies including rule-based
verification, controlled trajectory corruption, and hard negative mining. To
address the second challenge, a self-improvement pipeline progressively expands
solvable complex GUI tasks by enhancing both the agent and reward models
through reward-guided exploration and outcome verification in dynamic
environments. For training the model, we generate UI- Genie-RM-517k and
UI-Genie-Agent-16k, establishing the first reward-specific dataset for GUI
agents while demonstrating high-quality synthetic trajectory gen- eration
without manual annotation. Experimental results show that UI-Genie achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple GUI agent benchmarks with three
generations of data-model self-improvement. We open-source our complete
framework implementation and generated datasets to facilitate further research

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为“Catfish Agent”的角色专用LLM，用于解决多智能体框架中的“Silent Agreement”问题，通过结构化异议提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体框架在临床问答中虽能提升准确性，但存在“Silent Agreement”问题，即智能体过早达成共识而缺乏深入分析。

Method: 引入Catfish Agent，采用复杂性感知和语气校准两种机制，激励智能体在复杂或模糊病例中进行更深入推理。

Result: 在多个医学问答和视觉问答基准测试中，该方法显著优于单智能体和多智能体框架，包括GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1。

Conclusion: Catfish Agent通过结构化异议有效解决了“Silent Agreement”问题，提升了临床问答的诊断准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in clinical
question answering, with recent multi-agent frameworks further improving
diagnostic accuracy via collaborative reasoning. However, we identify a
recurring issue of Silent Agreement, where agents prematurely converge on
diagnoses without sufficient critical analysis, particularly in complex or
ambiguous cases. We present a new concept called Catfish Agent, a
role-specialized LLM designed to inject structured dissent and counter silent
agreement. Inspired by the ``catfish effect'' in organizational psychology, the
Catfish Agent is designed to challenge emerging consensus to stimulate deeper
reasoning. We formulate two mechanisms to encourage effective and context-aware
interventions: (i) a complexity-aware intervention that modulates agent
engagement based on case difficulty, and (ii) a tone-calibrated intervention
articulated to balance critique and collaboration. Evaluations on nine medical
Q&A and three medical VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms both single- and multi-agent LLMs frameworks, including leading
commercial models such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言对齐如何通过高资源语言向低资源语言转移能力，以及通过语言特定神经元更具体地理解LLMs在多语言场景中的机制。

Method: 提出新的细粒度神经元识别算法，分析神经元分布特性，并将LLMs的多语言推理过程分为四个部分。

Result: 系统分析了对齐前后的模型，发现不同类型的神经元分布特性，并研究了“自发多语言对齐”现象。

Conclusion: 通过神经元类型的分析，为理解多语言对齐和LLMs的多语言能力提供了实证结果和宝贵见解。

Abstract: Multilingual Alignment is an effective and representative paradigm to enhance
LLMs' multilingual capabilities, which transfers the capabilities from the
high-resource languages to the low-resource languages. Meanwhile, some
researches on language-specific neurons reveal that there are language-specific
neurons that are selectively activated in LLMs when processing different
languages. This provides a new perspective to analyze and understand LLMs'
mechanisms more specifically in multilingual scenarios. In this work, we
propose a new finer-grained neuron identification algorithm, which detects
language neurons~(including language-specific neurons and language-related
neurons) and language-agnostic neurons. Furthermore, based on the
distributional characteristics of different types of neurons, we divide the
LLMs' internal process for multilingual inference into four parts: (1)
multilingual understanding, (2) shared semantic space reasoning, (3)
multilingual output space transformation, and (4) vocabulary space outputting.
Additionally, we systematically analyze the models before and after alignment
with a focus on different types of neurons. We also analyze the phenomenon of
''Spontaneous Multilingual Alignment''. Overall, our work conducts a
comprehensive investigation based on different types of neurons, providing
empirical results and valuable insights for better understanding multilingual
alignment and multilingual capabilities of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于推理的多目标跟踪任务ReaMOT，并构建了ReaMOT Challenge基准，同时提出了训练无关的ReaTrack框架作为基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RMOT任务对复杂推理性语言指令的适应性不足，需要更挑战性的任务来评估模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出ReaMOT任务和基准，包含多难度推理指令；提出ReaTrack框架，基于LVLM和SAM2实现。

Result: ReaTrack在ReaMOT Challenge上表现有效。

Conclusion: ReaMOT任务和ReaTrack框架为复杂推理性跟踪提供了新方向和基线。

Abstract: Referring Multi-object tracking (RMOT) is an important research field in
computer vision. Its task form is to guide the models to track the objects that
conform to the language instruction. However, the RMOT task commonly requires
clear language instructions, such methods often fail to work when complex
language instructions with reasoning characteristics appear. In this work, we
propose a new task, called Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking (ReaMOT).
ReaMOT is a more challenging task that requires accurate reasoning about
objects that match the language instruction with reasoning characteristic and
tracking the objects' trajectories. To advance the ReaMOT task and evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of tracking models, we construct ReaMOT Challenge, a
reasoning-based multi-object tracking benchmark built upon 12 datasets.
Specifically, it comprises 1,156 language instructions with reasoning
characteristic, 423,359 image-language pairs, and 869 diverse scenes, which is
divided into three levels of reasoning difficulty. In addition, we propose a
set of evaluation metrics tailored for the ReaMOT task. Furthermore, we propose
ReaTrack, a training-free framework for reasoning-based multi-object tracking
based on large vision-language models (LVLM) and SAM2, as a baseline for the
ReaMOT task. Extensive experiments on the ReaMOT Challenge benchmark
demonstrate the effectiveness of our ReaTrack framework.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing models offer increased personalization
opportunities in generative tasks. However, properly evaluating their results
is challenging, and most of the existing metrics lag in terms of alignment with
human judgment and explainability. To tackle these issues, we introduce DICE
(DIfference Coherence Estimator), a model designed to detect localized
differences between the original and the edited image and to assess their
relevance to the given modification request. DICE consists of two key
components: a difference detector and a coherence estimator, both built on an
autoregressive Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and trained using a
strategy that leverages self-supervision, distillation from inpainting
networks, and full supervision. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate each
stage of our pipeline, comparing different MLLMs within the proposed framework.
We demonstrate that DICE effectively identifies coherent edits, effectively
evaluating images generated by different editing models with a strong
correlation with human judgment. We publicly release our source code, models,
and data.

Motivation: 解决运动预测中场景约束和交互行为带来的复杂性，通过逆向信息流提升预测能力。

Method: 使用Transformer模型，通过重新编码边际分布和成对建模生成联合分布，并采用压缩指数幂分布建模位置不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了运动预测性能，还能适应目标指令和场景上下文，展示了良好的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Motion forecasts of road users (i.e., agents) vary in complexity as a
function of scene constraints and interactive behavior. We address this with a
multi-task learning method for motion forecasting that includes a retrocausal
flow of information. The corresponding tasks are to forecast (1) marginal
trajectory distributions for all modeled agents and (2) joint trajectory
distributions for interacting agents. Using a transformer model, we generate
the joint distributions by re-encoding marginal distributions followed by
pairwise modeling. This incorporates a retrocausal flow of information from
later points in marginal trajectories to earlier points in joint trajectories.
Per trajectory point, we model positional uncertainty using compressed
exponential power distributions. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art
results in the Waymo Interaction Prediction dataset and generalizes well to the
Argoverse 2 dataset. Additionally, our method provides an interface for issuing
instructions through trajectory modifications. Our experiments show that
regular training of motion forecasting leads to the ability to follow
goal-based instructions and to adapt basic directional instructions to the
scene context. Code: https://github.com/kit-mrt/future-motion

Conclusion: MMPerspective为诊断和提升视觉语言系统的空间理解能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Understanding perspective is fundamental to human visual perception, yet the
extent to which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) internalize
perspective geometry remains unclear. We introduce MMPerspective, the first
benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding
of perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary
dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark
comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083
question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point
perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship
understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving
transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art
MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence
on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning
and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further
reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective
capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of
chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for
diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems.

Method: 提出双图像扩散模型和基于Chain-of-Thought的图推理器，并开发自动化数据集扩展管道LEGO-Art。

Result: DIPO显著优于基线方法，新数据集PM-X提升了复杂关节物体的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DIPO和PM-X为3D关节物体生成提供了高效解决方案，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: We present DIPO, a novel framework for the controllable generation of
articulated 3D objects from a pair of images: one depicting the object in a
resting state and the other in an articulated state. Compared to the
single-image approach, our dual-image input imposes only a modest overhead for
data collection, but at the same time provides important motion information,
which is a reliable guide for predicting kinematic relationships between parts.
Specifically, we propose a dual-image diffusion model that captures
relationships between the image pair to generate part layouts and joint
parameters. In addition, we introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based graph
reasoner that explicitly infers part connectivity relationships. To further
improve robustness and generalization on complex articulated objects, we
develop a fully automated dataset expansion pipeline, name LEGO-Art, that
enriches the diversity and complexity of PartNet-Mobility dataset. We propose
PM-X, a large-scale dataset of complex articulated 3D objects, accompanied by
rendered images, URDF annotations, and textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DIPO significantly outperforms existing baselines
in both the resting state and the articulated state, while the proposed PM-X
dataset further enhances generalization to diverse and structurally complex
articulated objects. Our code and dataset will be released to the community
upon publication.

Result: 实验表明CCL-LGS优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CCL-LGS有效解决语义冲突，保持类别区分性，提升3D语义理解质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction techniques and vision-language models
have fueled significant progress in 3D semantic understanding, a capability
critical to robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual/augmented reality.
However, methods that rely on 2D priors are prone to a critical challenge:
cross-view semantic inconsistencies induced by occlusion, image blur, and
view-dependent variations. These inconsistencies, when propagated via
projection supervision, deteriorate the quality of 3D Gaussian semantic fields
and introduce artifacts in the rendered outputs. To mitigate this limitation,
we propose CCL-LGS, a novel framework that enforces view-consistent semantic
supervision by integrating multi-view semantic cues. Specifically, our approach
first employs a zero-shot tracker to align a set of SAM-generated 2D masks and
reliably identify their corresponding categories. Next, we utilize CLIP to
extract robust semantic encodings across views. Finally, our Contrastive
Codebook Learning (CCL) module distills discriminative semantic features by
enforcing intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness. In contrast
to previous methods that directly apply CLIP to imperfect masks, our framework
explicitly resolves semantic conflicts while preserving category
discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCL-LGS outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods. Our project page is available at

Result: 在多个驾驶数据集上验证了生成多样化且可控天气效果的能力。

Conclusion: WeatherEdit在自动驾驶模拟中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: In this work, we present WeatherEdit, a novel weather editing pipeline for
generating realistic weather effects with controllable types and severity in 3D
scenes. Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background
editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we
introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a
single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather
effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View
(TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal
and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and
multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a
3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field
to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and
dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based
modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and
flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with
the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects.
Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can
generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity,
highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse
weather. See project page: https://jumponthemoon.github.io/w-edit

Result: 实验证明ControlTac能有效增强触觉数据集并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: ControlTac在真实场景中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensing has been widely used in perception,
reconstruction, and robotic manipulation. However, collecting large-scale
tactile data remains costly due to the localized nature of sensor-object
interactions and inconsistencies across sensor instances. Existing approaches
to scaling tactile data, such as simulation and free-form tactile generation,
often suffer from unrealistic output and poor transferability to downstream
tasks.To address this, we propose ControlTac, a two-stage controllable
framework that generates realistic tactile images conditioned on a single
reference tactile image, contact force, and contact position. With those
physical priors as control input, ControlTac generates physically plausible and
varied tactile images that can be used for effective data augmentation. Through
experiments on three downstream tasks, we demonstrate that ControlTac can
effectively augment tactile datasets and lead to consistent gains. Our three
real-world experiments further validate the practical utility of our approach.

Abstract: The global challenge of sustainable recycling demands automated, fast, and
accurate, state-of-the-art (SOTA) material detection systems that act as a
bedrock for a circular economy. Democratizing access to these cutting-edge
solutions that enable real-time waste analysis is essential for scaling up

\textbf{Electrolyzers-HSI}, a novel multimodal benchmark dataset designed to
accelerate the recovery of critical raw materials through accurate electrolyzer
materials classification. The dataset comprises 55 co-registered
high-resolution RGB images and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data cubes spanning
the 400--2500 nm spectral range, yielding over 4.2 million pixel vectors and
424,169 labeled ones. This enables non-invasive spectral analysis of shredded
electrolyzer samples, supporting quantitative and qualitative material
classification and spectral properties investigation. We evaluate a suite of
baseline machine learning (ML) methods alongside SOTA transformer-based deep
learning (DL) architectures, including Vision Transformer, SpectralFormer, and
the Multimodal Fusion Transformer, to investigate architectural bottlenecks for
further efficiency optimisation when deploying transformers in material
identification. We implement zero-shot detection techniques and majority voting
across pixel-level predictions to establish object-level classification
robustness. In adherence to the FAIR data principles, the electrolyzers-HSI
dataset and accompanying codebase are openly available at

Conclusion: CPathAgent展示了代理诊断方法的有效性，为计算病理学的未来发展指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology have led to the emergence of
numerous foundation models. However, these approaches fail to replicate the
diagnostic process of pathologists, as they either simply rely on
general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for classification or
directly apply multimodal models to generate reports from images. A significant
limitation is their inability to emulate the diagnostic logic employed by
pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification for
overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate
comprehensive diagnoses. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an
innovative agent-based model that mimics pathologists' reasoning processes by
autonomously executing zoom-in/out and navigation operations across pathology
images based on observed visual features. To achieve this, we develop a
multi-stage training strategy unifying patch-level, region-level, and
whole-slide capabilities within a single model, which is essential for
mimicking pathologists, who require understanding and reasoning capabilities
across all three scales. This approach generates substantially more detailed
and interpretable diagnostic reports compared to existing methods, particularly
for huge region understanding. Additionally, we construct an expert-validated
PathMMU-HR$^{2}$, the first benchmark for huge region analysis, a critical
intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, as diagnosticians
typically examine several key regions rather than entire slides at once.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms
existing approaches across three scales of benchmarks, validating the
effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a
promising direction for the future development of computational pathology.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种特征级偏差评估框架，用于在测试集缺乏人口统计标签的情况下评估FER模型的偏差，并引入统计模块确保结果的显著性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FER模型存在对某些人口群体的偏见，但公开数据集中缺乏标注限制了分析范围，伪标签可能扭曲结果。

Method: 提出特征级偏差评估框架，无需人口统计标签，并加入统计模块验证显著性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比依赖伪标签的方法更有效，且揭示了FER模型中显著的年龄、性别和种族偏见。

Conclusion: 该框架为FER模型的公平性评估提供了可靠工具，并指导选择更公平的网络架构。

Abstract: Recent studies on fairness have shown that Facial Expression Recognition
(FER) models exhibit biases toward certain visually perceived demographic
groups. However, the limited availability of human-annotated demographic labels
in public FER datasets has constrained the scope of such bias analysis. To
overcome this limitation, some prior works have resorted to pseudo-demographic
labels, which may distort bias evaluation results. Alternatively, in this
paper, we propose a feature-level bias evaluation framework for evaluating
demographic biases in FER models under the setting where demographic labels are
unavailable in the test set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
more effectively evaluates demographic biases compared to existing approaches
that rely on pseudo-demographic labels. Furthermore, we observe that many
existing studies do not include statistical testing in their bias evaluations,
raising concerns that some reported biases may not be statistically significant
but rather due to randomness. To address this issue, we introduce a
plug-and-play statistical module to ensure the statistical significance of
biased evaluation results. A comprehensive bias analysis based on the proposed
module is then conducted across three sensitive attributes (age, gender, and
race), seven facial expressions, and multiple network architectures on a
large-scale dataset, revealing the prominent demographic biases in FER and
providing insights on selecting a fairer network architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于提示调优的高效个性化手写文本识别框架，通过自监督损失和元学习优化，显著减少了参数更新需求，并在基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手写文本识别方法缺乏对多样书写风格的个性化适应，且现有元学习方法需要标注数据和大量计算资源。

Method: 将个性化问题转化为提示调优任务，结合自监督损失和元学习优化提示初始化，仅需更新少量参数。

Result: 在RIMES和IAM基准测试中表现优于现有方法，参数更新量减少20倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限场景下的个性化手写文本识别提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in handwritten text recognition (HTR) have enabled the
effective conversion of handwritten text to digital formats. However, achieving
robust recognition across diverse writing styles remains challenging.
Traditional HTR methods lack writer-specific personalization at test time due
to limitations in model architecture and training strategies. Existing attempts
to bridge this gap, through gradient-based meta-learning, still require labeled
examples and suffer from parameter-inefficient fine-tuning, leading to
substantial computational and memory overhead. To overcome these challenges, we
propose an efficient framework that formulates personalization as prompt
tuning, incorporating an auxiliary image reconstruction task with a
self-supervised loss to guide prompt adaptation with unlabeled test-time
examples. To ensure self-supervised loss effectively minimizes text recognition
error, we leverage meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization of the
prompts. As a result, our method allows the model to efficiently capture unique
writing styles by updating less than 1% of its parameters and eliminating the
need for time-intensive annotation processes. We validate our approach on the
RIMES and IAM Handwriting Database benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods while using 20x fewer parameters.
We believe this represents a significant advancement in personalized
handwritten text recognition, paving the way for more reliable and practical
deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

*Aniket Roy,Maitreya Suin,Ketul Shah,Rama Chellappa*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: MultLFG是一种无需训练的多LoRA组合框架，通过频域指导实现自适应融合，显著提升多概念生成任务的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在无需训练的情况下难以有效合并多个LoRA适配器，尤其是在涉及复杂视觉元素的组合中。

Method: MultLFG采用基于时间步和频域子带的自适应融合策略，选择性激活相关LoRA。

Result: 在ComposLoRA基准测试中，MultLFG显著提升了组合保真度和图像质量，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MultLFG通过频域指导实现了更准确和一致的多LoRA组合，为生成任务提供了更精细的控制。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained prominence as a computationally
efficient method for fine-tuning generative models, enabling distinct visual
concept synthesis with minimal overhead. However, current methods struggle to
effectively merge multiple LoRA adapters without training, particularly in
complex compositions involving diverse visual elements. We introduce MultLFG, a
novel framework for training-free multi-LoRA composition that utilizes
frequency-domain guidance to achieve adaptive fusion of multiple LoRAs. Unlike
existing methods that uniformly aggregate concept-specific LoRAs, MultLFG
employs a timestep and frequency subband adaptive fusion strategy, selectively
activating relevant LoRAs based on content relevance at specific timesteps and
frequency bands. This frequency-sensitive guidance not only improves spatial
coherence but also provides finer control over multi-LoRA composition, leading
to more accurate and consistent results. Experimental evaluations on the
ComposLoRA benchmark reveal that MultLFG substantially enhances compositional
fidelity and image quality across various styles and concept sets,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in multi-concept generation tasks.
Code will be released.

Motivation: 传统视频Re-ID方法依赖表面相关性（如服装、背景），难以泛化到不同领域、视角和时间变化，因此需要因果推理作为更可靠的方法。

Method: 论文围绕结构因果模型、干预和反事实推理，提出了一种新的因果Re-ID方法分类法，包括生成解耦、领域不变建模和因果Transformer。

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) remains brittle in real-world
deployments despite impressive benchmark performance. Most existing models rely
on superficial correlations such as clothing, background, or lighting that fail
to generalize across domains, viewpoints, and temporal variations. This survey
examines the emerging role of causal reasoning as a principled alternative to
traditional correlation-based approaches in video-based Re-ID. We provide a
structured and critical analysis of methods that leverage structural causal
models, interventions, and counterfactual reasoning to isolate
identity-specific features from confounding factors. The survey is organized
around a novel taxonomy of causal Re-ID methods that spans generative
disentanglement, domain-invariant modeling, and causal transformers. We review
current evaluation metrics and introduce causal-specific robustness measures.
In addition, we assess practical challenges of scalability, fairness,
interpretability, and privacy that must be addressed for real-world adoption.
Finally, we identify open problems and outline future research directions that
integrate causal modeling with efficient architectures and self-supervised
learning. This survey aims to establish a coherent foundation for causal
video-based person Re-ID and to catalyze the next phase of research in this
rapidly evolving domain.

Motivation: 现有方法通常独立处理面部重演和肖像重照明，缺乏协同效应，Total-Editing旨在统一控制外观、运动和光照。

Method: 设计了具有固有分解能力的神经辐射场解码器，并结合基于移动最小二乘的变形场，以增强时空一致性。

Result: 显著提升了肖像编辑的质量和真实感，支持多源应用如光照转移和肖像动画。

Conclusion: Total-Editing通过统一框架实现了更灵活、高质量的肖像编辑。

Abstract: Face reenactment and portrait relighting are essential tasks in portrait
editing, yet they are typically addressed independently, without much synergy.
Most face reenactment methods prioritize motion control and multiview
consistency, while portrait relighting focuses on adjusting shading effects. To
take advantage of both geometric consistency and illumination awareness, we
introduce Total-Editing, a unified portrait editing framework that enables
precise control over appearance, motion, and lighting. Specifically, we design
a neural radiance field decoder with intrinsic decomposition capabilities. This
allows seamless integration of lighting information from portrait images or HDR
environment maps into synthesized portraits. We also incorporate a moving least
squares based deformation field to enhance the spatiotemporal coherence of
avatar motion and shading effects. With these innovations, our unified
framework significantly improves the quality and realism of portrait editing
results. Further, the multi-source nature of Total-Editing supports more
flexible applications, such as illumination transfer from one portrait to
another, or portrait animation with customized backgrounds.

TLDR: OmniIndoor3D是一种基于高斯表示的室内3D重建框架，通过联合优化外观、几何和全景重建，实现高精度的室内场景理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯表示（3DGS）主要用于逼真渲染，缺乏高质量的几何精度，难以满足全景重建需求。

Method: 结合RGB-D图像生成粗略3D重建，初始化3D高斯并指导训练；引入轻量级MLP调整几何属性；提出基于全景先验的高斯基元分布优化策略。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现外观、几何和全景重建的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: OmniIndoor3D填补了室内3D重建的关键空白，为机器人导航提供准确支持。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for comprehensive indoor 3D reconstruction using
Gaussian representations, called OmniIndoor3D. This framework enables accurate
appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction of diverse indoor scenes
captured by a consumer-level RGB-D camera. Since 3DGS is primarily optimized
for photorealistic rendering, it lacks the precise geometry critical for
high-quality panoptic reconstruction. Therefore, OmniIndoor3D first combines
multiple RGB-D images to create a coarse 3D reconstruction, which is then used
to initialize the 3D Gaussians and guide the 3DGS training. To decouple the
optimization conflict between appearance and geometry, we introduce a
lightweight MLP that adjusts the geometric properties of 3D Gaussians. The
introduced lightweight MLP serves as a low-pass filter for geometry
reconstruction and significantly reduces noise in indoor scenes. To improve the
distribution of Gaussian primitives, we propose a densification strategy guided
by panoptic priors to encourage smoothness on planar surfaces. Through the
joint optimization of appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction,
OmniIndoor3D provides comprehensive 3D indoor scene understanding, which
facilitates accurate and robust robotic navigation. We perform thorough
evaluations across multiple datasets, and OmniIndoor3D achieves
state-of-the-art results in appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction.
We believe our work bridges a critical gap in indoor 3D reconstruction. The

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于Mamba的拓扑融合框架，通过骨骼感知模块和增强的卷积结构，解决了Mamba模型在处理3D人体姿态估计中的局限性，显著降低了计算成本并提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在3D人体姿态估计中因自注意力机制复杂度高而面临计算挑战，Mamba模型虽能降低计算开销，但对拓扑结构数据的处理能力不足。

Method: 设计了骨骼感知模块推断骨骼向量方向与长度，增强Mamba的卷积结构以捕捉局部关节关系，并引入时空细化模块建模时空关系。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上实验表明，该方法显著降低计算成本并提高准确性。

Conclusion: 通过融合骨骼拓扑结构，有效解决了Mamba模型的局限性，实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods for 3-D human pose estimation face significant
computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of self-attention
mechanism complexity with sequence length. Recently, the Mamba model has
substantially reduced computational overhead and demonstrated outstanding
performance in modeling long sequences by leveraging state space model (SSM).
However, the ability of SSM to process sequential data is not suitable for 3-D
joint sequences with topological structures, and the causal convolution
structure in Mamba also lacks insight into local joint relationships. To
address these issues, we propose the Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion framework in
this paper. Specifically, the proposed Bone Aware Module infers the direction
and length of bone vectors in the spherical coordinate system, providing
effective topological guidance for the Mamba model in processing joint
sequences. Furthermore, we enhance the convolutional structure within the Mamba
model by integrating forward and backward graph convolutional network, enabling
it to better capture local joint dependencies. Finally, we design a
Spatiotemporal Refinement Module to model both temporal and spatial
relationships within the sequence. Through the incorporation of skeletal
topology, our approach effectively alleviates Mamba's limitations in capturing
human structural relationships. We conduct extensive experiments on the
Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets for testing and comparison, and the results
show that the proposed method greatly reduces computational cost while
achieving higher accuracy. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of each proposed module. The code and models will be released.

Motivation: 现有VLMs在零样本检测常见物体上表现优异，但对分布外类别、任务和成像模态泛化能力不足，需改进对齐方法。

Method: 提出使用包含少量视觉示例和丰富文本描述的标注指令对齐VLMs，并发布Roboflow100-VL数据集进行多模态评估。

Result: 实验显示，GroundingDINO和Qwen2.5-VL在医疗影像数据集上的零样本准确率低于2%，表明需要少样本概念对齐。

Conclusion: 通过少样本对齐方法可显著提升VLMs对新概念的泛化能力，Roboflow100-VL为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve
remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck,
and pedestrian. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize
to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically
found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual
data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation
instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To
this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100
multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found
in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in
zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing
for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like
GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on
challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the
need for few-shot concept alignment. Our code and dataset are available at

TLDR: 该研究提出了一种基于离散余弦变换（DCT）的深度学习模型，用于预测阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停（OSA）患者五年内患高血压的风险，通过整合多导睡眠图信号和频率域特征提取，显著提高了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OSA是高血压的重要风险因素，但目前预测OSA患者五年内患高血压的准确性仍不足。研究旨在通过结合多导睡眠图信号和频率域特征提取，提升预测性能。

Method: 研究采用DCT变换和迁移学习方法，将多导睡眠图信号转换为2D表示，并利用预训练的2D神经网络（如MobileNet、EfficientNet和ResNet）进行特征学习。通过引入DCT层，将特征转换为频率域表示，增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 模型在EfficientNet中最佳截断深度下实现了72.88%的AUC，证明了频率域特征提取和迁移学习在预测OSA患者高血压风险中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了结合DCT和迁移学习的深度学习模型在预测OSA患者高血压风险中的潜力，为临床提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a significant risk factor for hypertension,
primarily due to intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation. Predicting
whether individuals with OSA will develop hypertension within five years
remains a complex challenge. This study introduces a novel deep learning
approach that integrates Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based transfer
learning to enhance prediction accuracy. We are the first to incorporate all
polysomnography signals together for hypertension prediction, leveraging their
collective information to improve model performance. Features were extracted
from these signals and transformed into a 2D representation to utilize
pre-trained 2D neural networks such as MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ResNet
variants. To further improve feature learning, we introduced a DCT layer, which
transforms input features into a frequency-based representation, preserving
essential spectral information, decorrelating features, and enhancing
robustness to noise. This frequency-domain approach, coupled with transfer
learning, is especially beneficial for limited medical datasets, as it
leverages rich representations from pre-trained networks to improve
generalization. By strategically placing the DCT layer at deeper truncation
depths within EfficientNet, our model achieved a best area under the curve
(AUC) of 72.88%, demonstrating the effectiveness of frequency-domain feature
extraction and transfer learning in predicting hypertension risk in OSA
patients over a five-year period.

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖昂贵体素标注或自监督性能不足的问题。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI验证集上达到16.59%的mIoU，仅需10%标注。

Conclusion: OccLE在减少标注成本的同时保持了高性能，为3D语义占用预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an intuitive and efficient scene
understanding and has attracted significant interest in autonomous driving
perception. Existing approaches either rely on full supervision, which demands
costly voxel-level annotations, or on self-supervision, which provides limited
guidance and yields suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we
propose OccLE, a Label-Efficient 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction that takes
images and LiDAR as inputs and maintains high performance with limited voxel
annotations. Our intuition is to decouple the semantic and geometric learning
tasks and then fuse the learned feature grids from both tasks for the final
semantic occupancy prediction. Therefore, the semantic branch distills 2D
foundation model to provide aligned pseudo labels for 2D and 3D semantic
learning. The geometric branch integrates image and LiDAR inputs in cross-plane
synergy based on their inherency, employing semi-supervision to enhance
geometry learning. We fuse semantic-geometric feature grids through Dual Mamba
and incorporate a scatter-accumulated projection to supervise unannotated
prediction with aligned pseudo labels. Experiments show that OccLE achieves
competitive performance with only 10% of voxel annotations, reaching a mIoU of
16.59% on the SemanticKITTI validation set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保持主题一致性和风格对齐方面存在不足，依赖大规模微调或优化，难以泛化或对齐文本描述。

Method: 通过操纵注意力矩阵，从锚定图像获取Queries和Keys，从非锚定图像导入Values，并在自注意力机制中添加跨图像组件。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效解耦风格与主题外观，生成文本对齐且主题一致的图像。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练即可实现风格对齐和主题一致性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In text-to-image models, consistent character generation is the task of
achieving text alignment while maintaining the subject's appearance across
different prompts. However, since style and appearance are often entangled, the
existing methods struggle to preserve consistent subject characteristics while
adhering to varying style prompts. Current approaches for consistent
text-to-image generation typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning on curated
image sets or per-subject optimization, which either fail to generalize across
prompts or do not align well with textual descriptions. Meanwhile,
training-free methods often fail to maintain subject consistency across
different styles. In this work, we introduce a training-free method that
achieves both style alignment and subject consistency. The attention matrices
are manipulated such that Queries and Keys are obtained from the anchor
image(s) that are used to define the subject, while the Values are imported
from a parallel copy that is not subject-anchored. Additionally, cross-image
components are added to the self-attention mechanism by expanding the Key and
Value matrices. To do without shifting from the target style, we align the
statistics of the Value matrices. As is demonstrated in a comprehensive battery
of qualitative and quantitative experiments, our method effectively decouples
style from subject appearance and enables faithful generation of text-aligned
images with consistent characters across diverse styles.

Motivation: 现有方法通常通过微调将视觉条件添加到T2V基础模型中，资源消耗大且仅限于预定义条件设置。

Method: 提出FlexTI2V，通过将条件图像反转为潜在空间噪声表示，并在去噪过程中使用随机块交换策略和动态控制机制。

Result: 实验表明，FlexTI2V显著优于其他无需训练的图像条件方法。

Conclusion: FlexTI2V提供了一种灵活且高效的TI2V生成解决方案。

Abstract: Text-image-to-video (TI2V) generation is a critical problem for controllable
video generation using both semantic and visual conditions. Most existing
methods typically add visual conditions to text-to-video (T2V) foundation
models by finetuning, which is costly in resources and only limited to a few
predefined conditioning settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce a unified
formulation for TI2V generation with flexible visual conditioning. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative training-free approach, dubbed FlexTI2V, that can
condition T2V foundation models on an arbitrary amount of images at arbitrary
positions. Specifically, we firstly invert the condition images to noisy
representation in a latent space. Then, in the denoising process of T2V models,
our method uses a novel random patch swapping strategy to incorporate visual
features into video representations through local image patches. To balance
creativity and fidelity, we use a dynamic control mechanism to adjust the
strength of visual conditioning to each video frame. Extensive experiments
validate that our method surpasses previous training-free image conditioning
methods by a notable margin. We also show more insights of our method by
detailed ablation study and analysis.

TLDR: 研究比较了两种肤色分类方法（ITA和基于$L^*$-$H^*$的方法）在面部情感分析系统中的公平性表现，发现深肤色样本严重不足且公平性差异显著，$L^*$-$H^*$方法更稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨肤色分类方法对公平性评估的影响，尤其是深肤色群体的代表性不足问题。

Method: 使用AffectNet数据集和MobileNet模型，比较ITA和$L^*$-$H^*$方法，并通过Grad-CAM分析模型注意力模式。

Result: 深肤色样本仅占2%，公平性指标（F1-score和TPR）差异显著，$L^*$-$H^*$方法更一致。

Conclusion: 肤色测量方法选择对公平性评估至关重要，ITA可能忽略深肤色群体的差异，建议采用$L^*$-$H^*$方法。

Abstract: Understanding how facial affect analysis (FAA) systems perform across
different demographic groups requires reliable measurement of sensitive
attributes such as ancestry, often approximated by skin tone, which itself is
highly influenced by lighting conditions. This study compares two objective
skin tone classification methods: the widely used Individual Typology Angle
(ITA) and a perceptually grounded alternative based on Lightness ($L^*$) and
Hue ($H^*$). Using AffectNet and a MobileNet-based model, we assess fairness
across skin tone groups defined by each method. Results reveal a severe
underrepresentation of dark skin tones ($\sim 2 \%$), alongside fairness
disparities in F1-score (up to 0.08) and TPR (up to 0.11) across groups. While
ITA shows limitations due to its sensitivity to lighting, the $H^*$-$L^*$
method yields more consistent subgrouping and enables clearer diagnostics
through metrics such as Equal Opportunity. Grad-CAM analysis further highlights
differences in model attention patterns by skin tone, suggesting variation in
feature encoding. To support future mitigation efforts, we also propose a
modular fairness-aware pipeline that integrates perceptual skin tone
estimation, model interpretability, and fairness evaluation. These findings
emphasize the relevance of skin tone measurement choices in fairness assessment
and suggest that ITA-based evaluations may overlook disparities affecting
darker-skinned individuals.

TLDR: Open-Det是一个高效的开放目标检测框架，通过重构检测器和名称生成器，结合视觉-语言对齐机制，显著提升了训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有开放目标检测模型（如GenerateU）需要大规模数据集、收敛慢且性能有限的问题。

Method: 提出Open-Det框架，包括重构检测器和名称生成器、视觉-语言对齐机制、提示蒸馏器和联合损失函数。

Result: 仅用1.5%的数据、20.8%的训练轮次和更少GPU资源，性能提升1.0%（APr）。

Conclusion: Open-Det在效率和性能上均优于现有方法，为开放目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Open-Ended object Detection (OED) is a novel and challenging task that
detects objects and generates their category names in a free-form manner,
without requiring additional vocabularies during inference. However, the
existing OED models, such as GenerateU, require large-scale datasets for
training, suffer from slow convergence, and exhibit limited performance. To
address these issues, we present a novel and efficient Open-Det framework,
consisting of four collaborative parts. Specifically, Open-Det accelerates
model training in both the bounding box and object name generation process by
reconstructing the Object Detector and the Object Name Generator. To bridge the
semantic gap between Vision and Language modalities, we propose a
Vision-Language Aligner with V-to-L and L-to-V alignment mechanisms,
incorporating with the Prompts Distiller to transfer knowledge from the VLM

addition, we design a Masked Alignment Loss to eliminate contradictory

more efficient training. Compared to GenerateU, Open-Det, using only 1.5% of

TLDR: IndustryEQA是首个专注于安全关键仓库场景的EQA基准，填补了工业环境中代理能力评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EQA基准主要关注家庭环境，忽视了工业环境中的安全关键问题和推理过程，限制了代理在真实工业应用中的评估。

Method: 基于NVIDIA Isaac Sim平台，IndustryEQA提供高保真视频、多样化工业资产和危险场景，包含六类丰富注释和额外推理评估。

Result: 包含1344个问答对（971来自小型仓库，373来自大型仓库），并提出综合评估框架和基线模型。

Conclusion: IndustryEQA旨在推动EQA研究，开发更鲁棒、安全感知且适用于复杂工业环境的代理。

Abstract: Existing Embodied Question Answering (EQA) benchmarks primarily focus on
household environments, often overlooking safety-critical aspects and reasoning
processes pertinent to industrial settings. This drawback limits the evaluation
of agent readiness for real-world industrial applications. To bridge this, we
introduce IndustryEQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating embodied
agent capabilities within safety-critical warehouse scenarios. Built upon the
NVIDIA Isaac Sim platform, IndustryEQA provides high-fidelity episodic memory
videos featuring diverse industrial assets, dynamic human agents, and carefully
designed hazardous situations inspired by real-world safety guidelines. The
benchmark includes rich annotations covering six categories: equipment safety,
human safety, object recognition, attribute recognition, temporal
understanding, and spatial understanding. Besides, it also provides extra
reasoning evaluation based on these categories. Specifically, it comprises 971
question-answer pairs generated from small warehouse and 373 pairs from large
ones, incorporating scenarios with and without human. We further propose a
comprehensive evaluation framework, including various baseline models, to
assess their general perception and reasoning abilities in industrial
environments. IndustryEQA aims to steer EQA research towards developing more
robust, safety-aware, and practically applicable embodied agents for complex
industrial environments. Benchmark and codes are available.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: LIAR框架通过选择性低光图像增强和光照感知组件，解决了夜间场景下的3D占用预测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉方法在夜间场景表现不佳，因光照条件差导致能见度低。

Method: LIAR引入选择性低光增强（SLLIE）和光照感知组件（2D-IGS和3D-IDP），分别处理全局和局部光照问题。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上，LIAR在夜间场景表现优异。

Conclusion: LIAR通过光照优化显著提升了夜间3D占用预测性能。

Abstract: Occupancy prediction aims to estimate the 3D spatial distribution of occupied
regions along with their corresponding semantic labels. Existing vision-based
methods perform well on daytime benchmarks but struggle in nighttime scenarios
due to limited visibility and challenging lighting conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{LIAR}, a novel framework that learns
illumination-affined representations. LIAR first introduces Selective Low-light
Image Enhancement (SLLIE), which leverages the illumination priors from daytime
scenes to adaptively determine whether a nighttime image is genuinely dark or
sufficiently well-lit, enabling more targeted global enhancement. Building on
the illumination maps generated by SLLIE, LIAR further incorporates two
illumination-aware components: 2D Illumination-guided Sampling (2D-IGS) and 3D
Illumination-driven Projection (3D-IDP), to respectively tackle local
underexposure and overexposure. Specifically, 2D-IGS modulates feature sampling
positions according to illumination maps, assigning larger offsets to darker
regions and smaller ones to brighter regions, thereby alleviating feature
degradation in underexposed areas. Subsequently, 3D-IDP enhances semantic
understanding in overexposed regions by constructing illumination intensity
fields and supplying refined residual queries to the BEV context refinement
process. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of LIAR under challenging nighttime scenarios. The
source code and pretrained models are available

Method: Scan-and-Print通过扫描选择适合放置元素的补丁，再通过打印混合补丁和顶点生成新样本，同时引入基于顶点的布局表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成高质量布局，并将计算瓶颈降低95.2%。

Conclusion: Scan-and-Print是一种高效且数据友好的布局生成方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In AI-empowered poster design, content-aware layout generation is crucial for
the on-image arrangement of visual-textual elements, e.g., logo, text, and
underlay. To perceive the background images, existing work demanded a high
parameter count that far exceeds the size of available training data, which has
impeded the model's real-time performance and generalization ability. To
address these challenges, we proposed a patch-level data summarization and
augmentation approach, vividly named Scan-and-Print. Specifically, the scan
procedure selects only the patches suitable for placing element vertices to
perform fine-grained perception efficiently. Then, the print procedure mixes up
the patches and vertices across two image-layout pairs to synthesize over 100%
new samples in each epoch while preserving their plausibility. Besides, to
facilitate the vertex-level operations, a vertex-based layout representation is
introduced. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks
demonstrated that Scan-and-Print can generate visually appealing layouts with
state-of-the-art quality while dramatically reducing computational bottleneck
by 95.2%.

Result: 在多个深度伪造检测数据集上表现优于现有域泛化技术。

Conclusion: 梯度对齐策略有效提升模型对域偏移的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in domain generalization for deepfake detection have
attracted significant attention, with previous methods often incorporating
additional modules to prevent overfitting to domain-specific patterns. However,
such regularization can hinder the optimization of the empirical risk
minimization (ERM) objective, ultimately degrading model performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel learning objective that aligns generalization
gradient updates with ERM gradient updates. The key innovation is the
application of perturbations to model parameters, aligning the ascending points
across domains, which specifically enhances the robustness of deepfake
detection models to domain shifts. This approach effectively preserves
domain-invariant features while managing domain-specific characteristics,
without introducing additional regularization. Experimental results on multiple
challenging deepfake detection datasets demonstrate that our gradient alignment
strategy outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques,
confirming the efficacy of our method. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统2D裁剪方法在场景中主体排列不佳时效果有限，而专业摄影师常通过3D透视调整优化构图。论文旨在扩展传统方法，解决透视变换数据集稀缺和评估标准缺失的问题。

Method: 提出了PPC方法，包括自动化构建数据集、生成展示透视变换过程的视频，以及基于人类表现的透视质量评估模型（PQA）。

Result: 实现了无需额外提示或相机轨迹的简洁方法，帮助普通用户提升构图技能。

Conclusion: PPC方法通过3D透视调整和自动化工具，有效弥补了传统2D裁剪的不足，为摄影构图提供了新思路。

Abstract: Traditional photography composition approaches are dominated by 2D
cropping-based methods. However, these methods fall short when scenes contain
poorly arranged subjects. Professional photographers often employ perspective
adjustment as a form of 3D recomposition, modifying the projected 2D
relationships between subjects while maintaining their actual spatial positions
to achieve better compositional balance. Inspired by this artistic practice, we
propose photography perspective composition (PPC), extending beyond traditional
cropping-based methods. However, implementing the PPC faces significant
challenges: the scarcity of perspective transformation datasets and undefined
assessment criteria for perspective quality. To address these challenges, we
present three key contributions: (1) An automated framework for building PPC
datasets through expert photographs. (2) A video generation approach that
demonstrates the transformation process from suboptimal to optimal
perspectives. (3) A perspective quality assessment (PQA) model constructed
based on human performance. Our approach is concise and requires no additional
prompt instructions or camera trajectories, helping and guiding ordinary users
to enhance their composition skills.

Motivation: 传统端到端模型在复杂场景中缺乏结构化推理能力，而现有的视觉语言模型（VLMs）因模块孤立和静态监督限制了多阶段决策能力。

Method: 将自动驾驶任务分解为四个核心任务，每个任务独立建模为视觉语言问答问题，并通过任务特定的奖励模型优化。

Result: DriveRX在公共基准测试中表现优异，行为推理优于GPT-4o，并在复杂或损坏的驾驶条件下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AutoDriveRL框架和DriveRX模型为自动驾驶研究提供了新的结构化推理方法，未来将开源以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires real-time, robust reasoning across perception,
prediction, planning, and behavior. However, conventional end-to-end models
fail to generalize in complex scenarios due to the lack of structured
reasoning. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have been applied to driving
tasks, but they typically rely on isolated modules and static supervision,
limiting their ability to support multi-stage decision-making. We present
AutoDriveRL, a unified training framework that formulates autonomous driving as
a structured reasoning process over four core tasks. Each task is independently
modeled as a vision-language question-answering problem and optimized using
task-specific reward models, enabling fine-grained reinforcement signals at
different reasoning stages. Within this framework, we train DriveRX, a
cross-task reasoning VLM designed for real-time decision-making. DriveRX
achieves strong performance on a public benchmark, outperforming GPT-4o in
behavior reasoning and demonstrating robustness under complex or corrupted
driving conditions. Our analysis further highlights the impact of vision
encoder design and reward-guided reasoning compression. We will release the
AutoDriveRL framework and the DriveRX model to support future research.

Result: 在大规模基准数据集上实验表明，方法显著降低误报率并提升检测精度。

Conclusion: CDN方法在跨域人脸伪造检测中表现出色，具有理论支持的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new cross-domain face forgery detection method
that is insensitive to different and possibly unseen forgery methods while
ensuring an acceptable low false positive rate. Although existing face forgery
detection methods are applicable to multiple domains to some degree, they often
come with a high false positive rate, which can greatly disrupt the usability
of the system. To address this issue, we propose an Contrastive Desensitization
Network (CDN) based on a robust desensitization algorithm, which captures the
essential domain characteristics through learning them from domain
transformation over pairs of genuine face images. One advantage of CDN lies in
that the learnt face representation is theoretical justified with regard to the
its robustness against the domain changes. Extensive experiments over
large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a much
lower false alarm rate with improved detection accuracy compared to several
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Student engagement plays a crucial role in the successful delivery of
educational programs. Automated engagement measurement helps instructors
monitor student participation, identify disengagement, and adapt their teaching
strategies to enhance learning outcomes effectively. This paper identifies two
key challenges in this problem: class imbalance and incorporating order into
engagement levels rather than treating it as mere categories. Then, a novel
approach to video-based student engagement measurement in virtual learning
environments is proposed that utilizes supervised contrastive learning for
ordinal classification of engagement. Various affective and behavioral features
are extracted from video samples and utilized to train ordinal classifiers
within a supervised contrastive learning framework (with a sequential
classifier as the encoder). A key step involves the application of diverse
time-series data augmentation techniques to these feature vectors, enhancing
model training. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using a
publicly available dataset for engagement measurement, DAiSEE, containing
videos of students who participated in virtual learning programs. The results
demonstrate the robust ability of the proposed method for the classification of
the engagement level. This approach promises a significant contribution to
understanding and enhancing student engagement in virtual learning
environments.

Method: TPPT利用文本原型作为稳定锚点，引导视觉提示学习（TPPT-V），并联合优化视觉和文本提示（TPPT-VT），引入关系多样性正则化。

Result: 实验表明TPPT有效减少遗忘并提升新知识学习效果，充分利用了CLIP的内在能力。

Conclusion: TPPT通过简洁设计显著提升持续学习性能，验证了利用CLIP内在指导的有效性。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) enables deep networks to acquire new knowledge while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The powerful generalization ability of
pre-trained models (PTMs), such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training
(CLIP) model, has inspired a range of CL methods targeting new and specialized
tasks, providing rich multi-modal embeddings that support lightweight,
incremental prompt tuning. Existing methods often rely on complex designs built
upon specific assumptions, such as intricate regularization schemes for prompt
pools, specialized routing mechanisms, or multi-stage incrementations, that
introduce additional-and possibly unnecessary-complexity, underutilizing CLIP's
intrinsic capabilities. In this paper, we propose a concise CL approach for
CLIP based on incremental prompt tuning that fully exploits its multi-modal
structure and the stability of textual representations. Our method, Textual
Prototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), introduces textual prototypes not merely
as static classifiers, as in existing methods, but as stable anchors to guide
the learning of visual prompts, thereby shaping the embedding space (i.e.,
TPPT-V). We show that our bidirectional supervision strategy enables more
effective learning of new knowledge while reducing forgetting. To further close
the vision-language gap during CL, we jointly optimizes visual and textual
prompts (i.e., TPPT-VT). We also introduce a relational diversity
regularization on the textual anchors to prevent embedding space collapse and
mitigate correlated forgetting. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting the benefits of
leveraging CLIP's intrinsic guidance for continual adaptation.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for dataset
compression, enabling the synthesis of compact surrogate datasets that
approximate the training utility of large-scale ones. While significant
progress has been achieved in distilling image datasets, extending DD to the
video domain remains challenging due to the high dimensionality and temporal
complexity inherent in video data. Existing video distillation (VD) methods
often suffer from excessive computational costs and struggle to preserve
temporal dynamics, as na\"ive extensions of image-based approaches typically
lead to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a novel uni-level video
dataset distillation framework that directly optimizes synthetic videos with
respect to a pre-trained model. To address temporal redundancy and enhance
motion preservation, we introduce a temporal saliency-guided filtering
mechanism that leverages inter-frame differences to guide the distillation
process, encouraging the retention of informative temporal cues while
suppressing frame-level redundancy. Extensive experiments on standard video
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
bridging the gap between real and distilled video data and offering a scalable
solution for video dataset compression.

Result: 实验表明ReCAP在多种数据集和场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReCAP通过区域置信度优化显著提升了WTTA的适应效率，为实时应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Wild Test-Time Adaptation (WTTA) is proposed to adapt a source model to
unseen domains under extreme data scarcity and multiple shifts. Previous
approaches mainly focused on sample selection strategies, while overlooking the
fundamental problem on underlying optimization. Initially, we critically
analyze the widely-adopted entropy minimization framework in WTTA and uncover
its significant limitations in noisy optimization dynamics that substantially
hinder adaptation efficiency. Through our analysis, we identify region
confidence as a superior alternative to traditional entropy, however, its
direct optimization remains computationally prohibitive for real-time
applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel region-integrated method
ReCAP that bypasses the lengthy process. Specifically, we propose a
probabilistic region modeling scheme that flexibly captures semantic changes in
embedding space. Subsequently, we develop a finite-to-infinite asymptotic
approximation that transforms the intractable region confidence into a
tractable and upper-bounded proxy. These innovations significantly unlock the
overlooked potential dynamics in local region in a concise solution. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of ReCAP over
existing methods across various datasets and wild scenarios.

Conclusion: HIEVT通过分层方法有效解决了UC-EVT任务中的指令理解与动作生成问题。

Abstract: User-Centric Embodied Visual Tracking (UC-EVT) presents a novel challenge for
reinforcement learning-based models due to the substantial gap between
high-level user instructions and low-level agent actions. While recent
advancements in language models (e.g., LLMs, VLMs, VLAs) have improved
instruction comprehension, these models face critical limitations in either
inference speed (LLMs, VLMs) or generalizability (VLAs) for UC-EVT tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Hierarchical Instruction-aware
Embodied Visual Tracking (HIEVT)} agent, which bridges instruction
comprehension and action generation using \textit{spatial goals} as
intermediaries. HIEVT first introduces \textit{LLM-based Semantic-Spatial Goal
Aligner} to translate diverse human instructions into spatial goals that
directly annotate the desired spatial position. Then the \textit{RL-based
Adaptive Goal-Aligned Policy}, a general offline policy, enables the tracker to
position the target as specified by the spatial goal. To benchmark UC-EVT
tasks, we collect over ten million trajectories for training and evaluate
across one seen environment and nine unseen challenging environments. Extensive
experiments and real-world deployments demonstrate the robustness and
generalizability of HIEVT across diverse environments, varying target dynamics,
and complex instruction combinations. The complete project is available at

Abstract: Video temporal understanding is crucial for multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to reason over events in videos. Despite recent advances in general
video understanding, current MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained temporal
reasoning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to address this
issue recently, existing RL approaches remain limited in effectiveness. In this
work, we propose MUSEG, a novel RL-based method that enhances temporal
understanding by introducing timestamp-aware multi-segment grounding. MUSEG
enables MLLMs to align queries with multiple relevant video segments, promoting
more comprehensive temporal reasoning. To facilitate effective learning, we
design a customized RL training recipe with phased rewards that progressively
guides the model toward temporally grounded reasoning. Extensive experiments on
temporal grounding and time-sensitive video QA tasks demonstrate that MUSEG
significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across diverse
temporal understanding scenarios. View our project at

Result: 实验显示性能显著提升，成功率分别提高72%（基于RL的方法）和220%（基于PID的方法）。

Abstract: We introduce a novel self-improving framework that enhances Embodied Visual
Tracking (EVT) with Visual-Language Models (VLMs) to address the limitations of
current active visual tracking systems in recovering from tracking failure. Our
approach combines the off-the-shelf active tracking methods with VLMs'
reasoning capabilities, deploying a fast visual policy for normal tracking and
activating VLM reasoning only upon failure detection. The framework features a
memory-augmented self-reflection mechanism that enables the VLM to
progressively improve by learning from past experiences, effectively addressing
VLMs' limitations in 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate
significant performance improvements, with our framework boosting success rates
by $72\%$ with state-of-the-art RL-based approaches and $220\%$ with PID-based
methods in challenging environments. This work represents the first integration
of VLM-based reasoning to assist EVT agents in proactive failure recovery,
offering substantial advances for real-world robotic applications that require
continuous target monitoring in dynamic, unstructured environments. Project

TLDR: LeDiFlow是一种基于Flow Matching的新型图像生成方法，通过优化先验分布减少ODE求解步骤，显著提升生成效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Models的迭代过程效率低，Flow Matching虽为替代方案，但传统方法依赖高斯先验导致计算复杂度高。

Method: 提出LeDiFlow，利用回归辅助模型学习更优先验分布，结合SOTA transformer架构和潜在空间采样。

Result: LeDiFlow在像素空间加速推理3.75倍，潜在空间模型提升图像质量1.32倍（CMMD指标）。

Conclusion: LeDiFlow通过优化先验分布和概率路径，显著提升Flow Matching的效率和性能。

Abstract: Enhancing the efficiency of high-quality image generation using Diffusion
Models (DMs) is a significant challenge due to the iterative nature of the
process. Flow Matching (FM) is emerging as a powerful generative modeling
paradigm based on a simulation-free training objective instead of a score-based
one used in DMs. Typical FM approaches rely on a Gaussian distribution prior,
which induces curved, conditional probability paths between the prior and
target data distribution. These curved paths pose a challenge for the Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE) solver, requiring a large number of inference calls
to the flow prediction network. To address this issue, we present Learned
Distribution-guided Flow Matching (LeDiFlow), a novel scalable method for
training FM-based image generation models using a better-suited prior
distribution learned via a regression-based auxiliary model. By initializing
the ODE solver with a prior closer to the target data distribution, LeDiFlow
enables the learning of more computationally tractable probability paths. These
paths directly translate to fewer solver steps needed for high-quality image
generation at inference time. Our method utilizes a State-Of-The-Art (SOTA)
transformer architecture combined with latent space sampling and can be trained
on a consumer workstation. We empirically demonstrate that LeDiFlow remarkably
outperforms the respective FM baselines. For instance, when operating directly
on pixels, our model accelerates inference by up to 3.75x compared to the
corresponding pixel-space baseline. Simultaneously, our latent FM model
enhances image quality on average by 1.32x in CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) metric against its respective baseline.

TLDR: Intern-GS利用视觉基础模型增强稀疏视图高斯泼溅，实现高质量场景重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图场景重建因数据有限导致信息不完整，现有方法效果不佳。

Method: Intern-GS结合DUSt3R生成密集高斯点云，并利用视觉基础模型预测深度和外观优化3D高斯。

Result: 在LLFF、DTU等数据集上实现最先进的渲染质量。

Conclusion: Intern-GS有效解决了稀疏视图重建的局限性，提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Sparse-view scene reconstruction often faces significant challenges due to
the constraints imposed by limited observational data. These limitations result
in incomplete information, leading to suboptimal reconstructions using existing
methodologies. To address this, we present Intern-GS, a novel approach that
effectively leverages rich prior knowledge from vision foundation models to
enhance the process of sparse-view Gaussian Splatting, thereby enabling
high-quality scene reconstruction. Specifically, Intern-GS utilizes vision
foundation models to guide both the initialization and the optimization process
of 3D Gaussian splatting, effectively addressing the limitations of sparse
inputs. In the initialization process, our method employs DUSt3R to generate a
dense and non-redundant gaussian point cloud. This approach significantly
alleviates the limitations encountered by traditional structure-from-motion
(SfM) methods, which often struggle under sparse-view constraints. During the
optimization process, vision foundation models predict depth and appearance for
unobserved views, refining the 3D Gaussians to compensate for missing
information in unseen regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Intern-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality across diverse datasets, including
both forward-facing and large-scale scenes, such as LLFF, DTU, and Tanks and
Temples.

TLDR: MoPFormer是一种自监督框架，通过将传感器信号转化为语义化的运动基元并利用Transformer架构提升可解释性和跨数据集泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可穿戴传感器在人类活动识别（HAR）中可解释性差和跨数据集泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）将传感器信号分割并量化为运动基元；2）通过上下文感知嵌入模块和Transformer编码器处理。

Result: 在六个HAR基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并显著提升跨数据集性能。

Conclusion: MoPFormer通过捕捉基础运动模式，提升了HAR的可解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is challenged by
limited interpretability, which significantly impacts cross-dataset
generalization. To address this challenge, we propose Motion-Primitive
Transformer (MoPFormer), a novel self-supervised framework that enhances
interpretability by tokenizing inertial measurement unit signals into
semantically meaningful motion primitives and leverages a Transformer
architecture to learn rich temporal representations. MoPFormer comprises
two-stages. first stage is to partition multi-channel sensor streams into short
segments and quantizing them into discrete "motion primitive" codewords, while
the second stage enriches those tokenized sequences through a context-aware
embedding module and then processes them with a Transformer encoder. The
proposed MoPFormer can be pre-trained using a masked motion-modeling objective
that reconstructs missing primitives, enabling it to develop robust
representations across diverse sensor configurations. Experiments on six HAR
benchmarks demonstrate that MoPFormer not only outperforms state-of-the-art
methods but also successfully generalizes across multiple datasets. Most
importantly, the learned motion primitives significantly enhance both
interpretability and cross-dataset performance by capturing fundamental
movement patterns that remain consistent across similar activities regardless
of dataset origin.

Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型在组合推理任务中表现不足，缺乏任务特定能力，阻碍其成为真正通用的视觉模型。

Method: 引入类似人类的‘理解-思考-回答’过程，无需多次推理或外部工具，支持单次前向传播完成任务。

Result: Griffon-R在VSR、CLEVR等复杂视觉推理基准上表现优异，同时在MMBench和ScienceQA等多模态任务中提升能力。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了基础视觉能力与通用问答之间的鸿沟，为复杂视觉推理提供了可信且可追溯的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable visual
understanding performance on both vision-language and vision-centric tasks.
However, they often fall short in integrating advanced, task-specific
capabilities for compositional reasoning, which hinders their progress toward
truly competent general vision models. To address this, we present a unified
visual reasoning mechanism that enables LMMs to solve complicated compositional
problems by leveraging their intrinsic capabilities (e.g. grounding and visual
understanding capabilities). Different from the previous shortcut learning
mechanism, our approach introduces a human-like
understanding-thinking-answering process, allowing the model to complete all
steps in a single pass forwarding without the need for multiple inferences or
external tools. This design bridges the gap between foundational visual
capabilities and general question answering, encouraging LMMs to generate
faithful and traceable responses for complex visual reasoning. Meanwhile, we
curate 334K visual instruction samples covering both general scenes and
text-rich scenes and involving multiple foundational visual capabilities. Our
trained model, Griffon-R, has the ability of end-to-end automatic
understanding, self-thinking, and reasoning answers. Comprehensive experiments
show that Griffon-R not only achieves advancing performance on complex visual
reasoning benchmarks including VSR and CLEVR, but also enhances multimodal
capabilities across various benchmarks like MMBench and ScienceQA. Data,
models, and codes will be release at

TLDR: PARTONOMY是一个用于像素级部分定位的LMM基准测试，揭示了现有LMM在部分定位能力上的不足，并提出PLUM模型以改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的物体由独特的、特定于物体的部分组成，识别这些部分对于细粒度的组合推理至关重要，但现有LMM在此任务上表现不佳。

Method: 通过构建PARTONOMY基准测试（包含862个部分标签和534个物体标签），并设计PLUM模型（采用跨度标记和反馈循环机制）来解决现有LMM的不足。

Result: 实验显示现有LMM表现较差（如LISA-13B仅5.9% gIoU），而PLUM在多个任务上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: PLUM模型为LMM的细粒度视觉理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: Real-world objects are composed of distinctive, object-specific parts.
Identifying these parts is key to performing fine-grained, compositional
reasoning-yet, large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to perform this
seemingly straightforward task. In this work, we introduce PARTONOMY, an LMM
benchmark designed for pixel-level part grounding. We construct PARTONOMY from
existing part datasets and our own rigorously annotated set of images,
encompassing 862 part labels and 534 object labels for evaluation. Unlike
existing datasets that simply ask models to identify generic parts, PARTONOMY
uses specialized concepts (e.g., agricultural airplane), and challenges models
to compare objects' parts, consider part-whole relationships, and justify
textual predictions with visual segmentations. Our experiments demonstrate
significant limitations in state-of-the-art LMMs (e.g., LISA-13B achieves only
5.9% gIoU), highlighting a critical gap in their part grounding abilities. We
note that existing segmentation-enabled LMMs (segmenting LMMs) have two key
architectural shortcomings: they use special [SEG] tokens not seen during
pretraining which induce distribution shift, and they discard predicted
segmentations instead of using past predictions to guide future ones. To
address these deficiencies, we train several part-centric LMMs and propose
PLUM, a novel segmenting LMM that uses span tagging instead of segmentation
tokens and that conditions on prior predictions in a feedback loop. We find
that pretrained PLUM outperforms existing segmenting LMMs on reasoning
segmentation, VQA, and visual hallucination benchmarks. In addition, PLUM
finetuned on our proposed Explanatory Part Segmentation task is competitive
with segmenting LMMs trained on significantly more segmentation data. Our work
opens up new avenues towards enabling fine-grained, grounded visual
understanding in LMMs.

Motivation: 现有方法在组合图像检索（CIR）任务中难以准确表示图像和文本修改，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出ConText-CIR框架，采用Text Concept-Consistency损失函数，并设计合成数据生成流程。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（如CIRR和CIRCO）上实现了监督和零样本设置下的新最佳性能。

Conclusion: ConText-CIR框架通过改进表示能力和数据生成方法，显著提升了CIR任务的性能。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image
specified by a query image and a relative text that describes a semantic
modification to the query image. Existing methods in CIR struggle to accurately
represent the image and the text modification, resulting in subpar performance.
To address this limitation, we introduce a CIR framework, ConText-CIR, trained
with a Text Concept-Consistency loss that encourages the representations of
noun phrases in the text modification to better attend to the relevant parts of
the query image. To support training with this loss function, we also propose a
synthetic data generation pipeline that creates training data from existing CIR
datasets or unlabeled images. We show that these components together enable
stronger performance on CIR tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art in composed
image retrieval in both the supervised and zero-shot settings on multiple
benchmark datasets, including CIRR and CIRCO. Source code, model checkpoints,
and our new datasets are available at https://github.com/mvrl/ConText-CIR.

TLDR: MetaSlot是一种改进的Slot Attention变体，通过动态调整对象数量，解决了传统方法中固定槽数导致的对象分割问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Object-Centric Learning方法因固定槽数导致对象被分割为多个部分，影响表示效果。

Method: MetaSlot通过维护对象原型代码库、去除重复槽和注入噪声优化Slot Attention。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中，MetaSlot显著提升了性能并生成更可解释的槽表示。

Conclusion: MetaSlot是一种通用且高效的Slot Attention改进方法，适用于现有OCL架构。

Abstract: Learning object-level, structured representations is widely regarded as a key
to better generalization in vision and underpins the design of next-generation
Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs). Mainstream Object-Centric Learning (OCL)
methods adopt Slot Attention or its variants to iteratively aggregate objects'
super-pixels into a fixed set of query feature vectors, termed slots. However,
their reliance on a static slot count leads to an object being represented as
multiple parts when the number of objects varies. We introduce MetaSlot, a
plug-and-play Slot Attention variant that adapts to variable object counts.
MetaSlot (i) maintains a codebook that holds prototypes of objects in a dataset
by vector-quantizing the resulting slot representations; (ii) removes duplicate
slots from the traditionally aggregated slots by quantizing them with the
codebook; and (iii) injects progressively weaker noise into the Slot Attention
iterations to accelerate and stabilize the aggregation. MetaSlot is a general
Slot Attention variant that can be seamlessly integrated into existing OCL
architectures. Across multiple public datasets and tasks--including object
discovery and recognition--models equipped with MetaSlot achieve significant
performance gains and markedly interpretable slot representations, compared
with existing Slot Attention variants.

Motivation: 现有方法在多模态环境中复制DeepSeek R1的推理能力时存在局限性，如推理与答案不一致、模型不稳定和数据效率低。

Method: TACO基于GRPO，引入Think-Answer Consistency和Rollback Resample Strategy，并结合自适应学习计划和Test-Time-Resolution-Scaling方案。

Result: 在REC和VQA任务中，TACO显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: TACO通过改进推理一致性和稳定性，以及优化数据效率，在多模态视觉推理中取得了显著进展。

Abstract: DeepSeek R1 has significantly advanced complex reasoning for large language
models (LLMs). While recent methods have attempted to replicate R1's reasoning
capabilities in multimodal settings, they face limitations, including
inconsistencies between reasoning and final answers, model instability and
crashes during long-chain exploration, and low data learning efficiency. To
address these challenges, we propose TACO, a novel reinforcement learning
algorithm for visual reasoning. Building on Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO), TACO introduces Think-Answer Consistency, which tightly
couples reasoning with answer consistency to ensure answers are grounded in
thoughtful reasoning. We also introduce the Rollback Resample Strategy, which
adaptively removes problematic samples and reintroduces them to the sampler,
enabling stable long-chain exploration and future learning opportunities.
Additionally, TACO employs an adaptive learning schedule that focuses on
moderate difficulty samples to optimize data efficiency. Furthermore, we
propose the Test-Time-Resolution-Scaling scheme to address performance
degradation due to varying resolutions during reasoning while balancing
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution benchmarks for REC and VQA tasks show that fine-tuning
LVLMs leads to significant performance improvements.

Motivation: 传统目标攻击方法局限于每个模型一个类别，且需为每个目标重新训练，多目标攻击虽改进但仍依赖训练数据，存在数据泄漏问题。

Method: CD-MTA采用基于图像的输入条件和类无关损失，减少对类嵌入的依赖，提升泛化能力。

Result: 在ImageNet等数据集上，CD-MTA在标准和跨域场景中优于现有方法，且无需访问训练数据。

Conclusion: CD-MTA通过去类语义依赖，实现了对未见类别的泛化攻击能力。

Abstract: We present Cross-Domain Multi-Targeted Attack (CD-MTA), a method for
generating adversarial examples that mislead image classifiers toward any
target class, including those not seen during training. Traditional targeted
attacks are limited to one class per model, requiring expensive retraining for
each target. Multi-targeted attacks address this by introducing a perturbation
generator with a conditional input to specify the target class. However,
existing methods are constrained to classes observed during training and
require access to the black-box model's training data--introducing a form of
data leakage that undermines realistic evaluation in practical black-box
scenarios. We identify overreliance on class embeddings as a key limitation,
leading to overfitting and poor generalization to unseen classes. To address
this, CD-MTA replaces class-level supervision with an image-based conditional
input and introduces class-agnostic losses that align the perturbed and target
images in the feature space. This design removes dependence on class semantics,
thereby enabling generalization to unseen classes across datasets. Experiments
on ImageNet and seven other datasets show that CD-MTA outperforms prior
multi-targeted attacks in both standard and cross-domain settings--without
accessing the black-box model's training data.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖手工先验，难以捕捉复杂数据。扩散模型虽强，但存在计算量大和收敛不佳的问题。

Method: 提出DMILO（中间层优化）和DMILO-PGD（结合投影梯度下降），扩展模型范围并优化收敛。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在多种图像数据集上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: DMILO和DMILO-PGD有效解决了扩散模型在逆问题中的常见挑战。

Abstract: Inverse problems (IPs) involve reconstructing signals from noisy
observations. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted priors, which
can fail to capture the complexity of real-world data. The advent of
pre-trained generative models has introduced new paradigms, offering improved
reconstructions by learning rich priors from data. Among these, diffusion
models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful framework, achieving remarkable
reconstruction performance across numerous IPs. However, existing DM-based
methods frequently encounter issues such as heavy computational demands and
suboptimal convergence. In this work, building upon the idea of the recent work
DMPlug~\cite{wang2024dmplug}, we propose two novel methods, DMILO and
DMILO-PGD, to address these challenges. Our first method, DMILO, employs
intermediate layer optimization (ILO) to alleviate the memory burden inherent
in DMPlug. Additionally, by introducing sparse deviations, we expand the range
of DMs, enabling the exploration of underlying signals that may lie outside the
range of the diffusion model. We further propose DMILO-PGD, which integrates
ILO with projected gradient descent (PGD), thereby reducing the risk of
suboptimal convergence. We provide an intuitive theoretical analysis of our
approach under appropriate conditions and validate its superiority through
extensive experiments on diverse image datasets, encompassing both linear and
nonlinear IPs. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of DMILO and DMILO-PGD
in addressing common challenges in DM-based IP solvers.

Result: RLRF显著提升SVG生成的准确性、效率和语义一致性。

Conclusion: RLRF为高质量SVG生成提供了一种有效方法，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) offer a powerful format for representing
visual designs as interpretable code. Recent advances in vision-language models
(VLMs) have enabled high-quality SVG generation by framing the problem as a
code generation task and leveraging large-scale pretraining. VLMs are
particularly suitable for this task as they capture both global semantics and
fine-grained visual patterns, while transferring knowledge across vision,
natural language, and code domains. However, existing VLM approaches often
struggle to produce faithful and efficient SVGs because they never observe the
rendered images during training. Although differentiable rendering for
autoregressive SVG code generation remains unavailable, rendered outputs can
still be compared to original inputs, enabling evaluative feedback suitable for
reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce RLRF(Reinforcement Learning from
Rendering Feedback), an RL method that enhances SVG generation in
autoregressive VLMs by leveraging feedback from rendered SVG outputs. Given an
input image, the model generates SVG roll-outs that are rendered and compared
to the original image to compute a reward. This visual fidelity feedback guides
the model toward producing more accurate, efficient, and semantically coherent
SVGs. RLRF significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning, addressing common
failure modes and enabling precise, high-quality SVG generation with strong
structural understanding and generalization.

Result: 实验表明，RAP在多种扩散模型上显著提升了稀有概念生成效果，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RAP通过因果路径导航和动态提示切换，有效提升了扩散模型在稀有概念生成上的表现。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in high-fidelity image
generation but often falter when synthesizing rare concepts, i.e., prompts that
are infrequently observed in the training distribution. In this paper, we
introduce RAP, a principled framework that treats rare concept generation as
navigating a latent causal path: a progressive, model-aligned trajectory
through the generative space from frequent concepts to rare targets. Rather
than relying on heuristic prompt alternation, we theoretically justify that
rare prompt guidance can be approximated by semantically related frequent
prompts. We then formulate prompt switching as a dynamic process based on score
similarity, enabling adaptive stage transitions. Furthermore, we reinterpret
prompt alternation as a second-order denoising mechanism, promoting smooth
semantic progression and coherent visual synthesis. Through this causal lens,
we align input scheduling with the model's internal generative dynamics.
Experiments across diverse diffusion backbones demonstrate that RAP
consistently enhances rare concept generation, outperforming strong baselines
in both automated evaluations and human studies.

Result: 在VBench 2.0基准测试中表现优异，尤其在复杂场景和动态变化中生成高质量长视频。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了长视频生成的指令跟随能力和质量，计划公开数据集和模型。

Abstract: Generating long videos that can show complex stories, like movie scenes from
scripts, has great promise and offers much more than short clips. However,
current methods that use autoregression with diffusion models often struggle
because their step-by-step process naturally leads to a serious error
accumulation (drift). Also, many existing ways to make long videos focus on
single, continuous scenes, making them less useful for stories with many events
and changes. This paper introduces a new approach to solve these problems.
First, we propose a novel way to annotate datasets at the frame-level,
providing detailed text guidance needed for making complex, multi-scene long
videos. This detailed guidance works with a Frame-Level Attention Mechanism to
make sure text and video match precisely. A key feature is that each part
(frame) within these windows can be guided by its own distinct text prompt. Our
training uses Diffusion Forcing to provide the model with the ability to handle
time flexibly. We tested our approach on difficult VBench 2.0 benchmarks
("Complex Plots" and "Complex Landscapes") based on the WanX2.1-T2V-1.3B model.
The results show our method is better at following instructions in complex,
changing scenes and creates high-quality long videos. We plan to share our
dataset annotation methods and trained models with the research community.

Conclusion: 通过因果分析和BAFFM模块，有效解决了场景偏差问题，提升了图像融合性能。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to combine complementary information from multiple source
images to generate more comprehensive scene representations. Existing methods
primarily rely on the stacking and design of network architectures to enhance
the fusion performance, often ignoring the impact of dataset scene bias on
model training. This oversight leads the model to learn spurious correlations
between specific scenes and fusion weights under conventional likelihood
estimation framework, thereby limiting fusion performance. To solve the above
problems, this paper first re-examines the image fusion task from the causality
perspective, and disentangles the model from the impact of bias by constructing
a tailored causal graph to clarify the causalities among the variables in image
fusion task. Then, the Back-door Adjustment based Feature Fusion Module (BAFFM)
is proposed to eliminate confounder interference and enable the model to learn
the true causal effect. Finally, Extensive experiments on three standard
datasets prove that the proposed method significantly surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in infrared and visible image fusion.

*Jingjun Yang,Liangwei Fan,Jinpu Zhang,Xiangkai Lian,Hui Shen,Dewen Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种名为SpikeFET的全脉冲帧事件跟踪框架，通过卷积局部特征提取和Transformer全局建模的协同整合，高效融合帧和事件数据，显著降低功耗并提升跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前融合方法在复杂环境中实现高性能视觉对象跟踪时，计算开销大且难以高效提取事件流中的稀疏异步信息，未能充分利用事件驱动脉冲范式的能效优势。

Method: 提出SpikeFET框架，结合卷积局部特征提取和Transformer全局建模；引入随机拼图模块（RPM）消除位置偏差；提出时空正则化（STR）策略增强时空一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SpikeFET在跟踪精度上优于现有方法，同时显著降低功耗，实现了性能与效率的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: SpikeEFT框架成功解决了帧和事件数据融合中的计算效率和能效问题，为复杂环境下的视觉对象跟踪提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of image and event streams offers a promising approach for
achieving robust visual object tracking in complex environments. However,
current fusion methods achieve high performance at the cost of significant
computational overhead and struggle to efficiently extract the sparse,
asynchronous information from event streams, failing to leverage the
energy-efficient advantages of event-driven spiking paradigms. To address this
challenge, we propose the first fully Spiking Frame-Event Tracking framework
called SpikeFET. This network achieves synergistic integration of convolutional
local feature extraction and Transformer-based global modeling within the
spiking paradigm, effectively fusing frame and event data. To overcome the
degradation of translation invariance caused by convolutional padding, we
introduce a Random Patchwork Module (RPM) that eliminates positional bias
through randomized spatial reorganization and learnable type encoding while
preserving residual structures. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal
Regularization (STR) strategy that overcomes similarity metric degradation from
asymmetric features by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency among temporal
template features in latent space. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior tracking
accuracy over existing methods while significantly reducing power consumption,
attaining an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. The code will
be released.

*Jason Chui,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种新的概率化BA方法（ProBA），无需相机位姿或焦距的先验知识，通过建模和传播2D观测与3D场景结构的不确定性，实现更鲁棒的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BA方法依赖准确的初始估计和已知相机内参，限制了其在不确定或未知内参情况下的适用性。

Method: 使用3D高斯代替点状地标，引入不确定性感知的重投影损失，并通过Bhattacharyya系数强制几何一致性。

Result: 实验表明，ProBA在挑战性现实条件下优于传统方法，减少了陷入局部极小的可能性。

Conclusion: ProBA无需强初始化和已知内参，提升了SLAM系统在非结构化环境中的实用性。

Abstract: Classical Bundle Adjustment (BA) methods require accurate initial estimates
for convergence and typically assume known camera intrinsics, which limits
their applicability when such information is uncertain or unavailable. We
propose a novel probabilistic formulation of BA (ProBA) that explicitly models
and propagates uncertainty in both the 2D observations and the 3D scene
structure, enabling optimization without any prior knowledge of camera poses or
focal length. Our method uses 3D Gaussians instead of point-like landmarks and
we introduce uncertainty-aware reprojection losses by projecting the 3D
Gaussians onto the 2D image space, and enforce geometric consistency across
multiple 3D Gaussians using the Bhattacharyya coefficient to encourage overlap
between their corresponding Gaussian distributions. This probabilistic
framework leads to more robust and reliable optimization, even in the presence
of outliers in the correspondence set, reducing the likelihood of converging to
poor local minima. Experimental results show that \textit{ProBA} outperforms
traditional methods in challenging real-world conditions. By removing the need
for strong initialization and known intrinsics, ProBA enhances the practicality
of SLAM systems deployed in unstructured environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部动作生成方法（如音频或文本信号）无法提供精确的时间控制，时间线控制可以填补这一空白。

Method: 通过Toeplitz逆协方差聚类标注面部动作时间区间，并基于标注数据提出扩散生成模型，支持文本引导的动作生成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能准确标注面部动作区间，并生成与时间线精确对齐的自然面部动作。

Conclusion: 时间线控制为面部动作生成提供了更精细的控制方式，结合文本引导扩展了应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new control signal for facial motion generation:
timeline control. Compared to audio and text signals, timelines provide more
fine-grained control, such as generating specific facial motions with precise
timing. Users can specify a multi-track timeline of facial actions arranged in
temporal intervals, allowing precise control over the timing of each action. To
model the timeline control capability, We first annotate the time intervals of
facial actions in natural facial motion sequences at a frame-level granularity.
This process is facilitated by Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-based Clustering to
minimize human labor. Based on the annotations, we propose a diffusion-based
generation model capable of generating facial motions that are natural and
accurately aligned with input timelines. Our method supports text-guided motion
generation by using ChatGPT to convert text into timelines. Experimental
results show that our method can annotate facial action intervals with
satisfactory accuracy, and produces natural facial motions accurately aligned
with timelines.

*Chaeyoung Jung,Youngjoon Jang,Joon Son Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为AVCD的新型解码框架，用于抑制多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题，通过动态识别主导模态和注意力掩码生成扰动输出，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的幻觉问题是一个主要挑战，尤其是在涉及音频、视频和语言的复杂交互中，现有方法难以适应。

Method: 提出Audio-Visual Contrastive Decoding (AVCD)，利用注意力分布动态识别非主导模态，并通过注意力掩码生成扰动输出；同时引入熵引导的自适应解码以提高效率。

Result: 在AVHBench数据集上，AVCD显著提升了VideoLLaMA2和video-SALMONN的准确率，分别提高了6%和11%。

Conclusion: AVCD在多模态解码中表现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为抑制模态诱导的幻觉提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a major challenge in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). To address this, various contrastive decoding (CD) methods have been
proposed that contrasts original logits with hallucinated logits generated from
perturbed inputs. While CD has shown promise in vision-language models (VLMs),
it is not well-suited for AV-LLMs, where hallucinations often emerge from both
unimodal and cross-modal combinations involving audio, video, and language.
These intricate interactions call for a more adaptive and modality-aware
decoding strategy. In this paper, we propose Audio-Visual Contrastive Decoding
(AVCD)-a novel, training-free decoding framework designed to model trimodal
interactions and suppress modality-induced hallucinations in AV-LLMs. Unlike
previous CD methods in VLMs that corrupt a fixed modality, AVCD leverages
attention distributions to dynamically identify less dominant modalities and
applies attentive masking to generate perturbed output logits. To support CD in
a trimodal setting, we also reformulate the original CD framework to jointly
handle audio, visual, and textual inputs. Finally, to improve efficiency, we
introduce entropy-guided adaptive decoding, which selectively skips unnecessary
decoding steps based on the model's confidence in its predictions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AVCD consistently outperforms existing decoding
methods. Especially, on the AVHBench dataset, it improves accuracy by 6% for
VideoLLaMA2 and 11% for video-SALMONN, demonstrating strong robustness and
generalizability.

in-context learning. By using examples in a prompt as well as a query, they are
capable of performing tasks such as few-shot, one-shot, or zero-shot learning
to output the corresponding answer to this query. One area of interest to us is
that these transformer models have been shown to be capable of learning the
general class of certain functions, such as linear functions and small 2-layer
neural networks, on random data (Garg et al, 2023). We aim to extend this to
the image space to analyze their capability to in-context learn more complex
functions on the image space, such as convolutional neural networks and other
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出Fork-Merge Decoding（FMD）方法，通过推理阶段的分支-合并策略解决音频-视觉大语言模型中的模态偏差问题，无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频-视觉大语言模型（AV-LLMs）在联合处理多模态特征时可能引入模态偏差，导致模型过度依赖某一模态。

Method: FMD在推理阶段先通过早期解码层分别处理音频和视频输入（分支阶段），再合并隐藏状态进行联合推理（合并阶段）。

Result: 在VideoLLaMA2和video-SALMONN模型上，FMD在音频、视频及音频-视觉联合推理任务中均表现提升。

Conclusion: FMD通过推理时干预有效提升了多模态理解的鲁棒性，无需额外训练或架构修改。

Abstract: The goal of this work is to enhance balanced multimodal understanding in
audio-visual large language models (AV-LLMs) by addressing modality bias
without requiring additional training. In current AV-LLMs, audio and video
features are typically processed jointly in the decoder. While this strategy
facilitates unified multimodal understanding, it may introduce modality bias,
where the model tends to over-rely on one modality due to imbalanced training
signals. To mitigate this, we propose Fork-Merge Decoding (FMD), a simple yet
effective inference-time strategy that requires no additional training or
architectural modifications. FMD first performs modality-specific reasoning by
processing audio-only and video-only inputs through the early decoder layers (a
fork phase), and then merges the resulting hidden states for joint reasoning in
the remaining layers (a merge phase). This approach promotes balanced modality
contributions and leverages complementary information across modalities. We
evaluate our method on two representative AV-LLMs, VideoLLaMA2 and
video-SALMONN, using three benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
consistent performance improvements on tasks focused on audio, video, and
combined audio-visual reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of
inference-time interventions for robust multimodal understanding.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a stereo radargrammetry method using deep learning
from airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images.Deep learning-based methods
are considered to suffer less from geometric image modulation, while there is
no public SAR image dataset used to train such methods.We create a SAR image
dataset and perform fine-tuning of a deep learning-based image correspondence
method.The proposed method suppresses the degradation of image quality by pixel

Abstract: Fire detection in dynamic environments faces continuous challenges, including
the interference of illumination changes, many false detections or missed

TLDR: CoDA框架通过频率组合统一模型压缩与域适应，结合量化感知训练和测试时适应，显著提升压缩模型在域偏移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代设备上的神经网络需在资源受限且域偏移不可预测的环境下运行，但现有方法仅单独处理压缩或域适应问题。

Method: CoDA采用量化感知训练（QAT）学习低频特征，测试时利用全频信息进行源无关的域适应，高频特征作为域特定线索。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C和ImageNet-C基准测试中，CoDA显著提升压缩模型性能，分别比全精度基线提高7.96%和5.37%。

Conclusion: CoDA为资源受限设备提供了一种高效统一的压缩与域适应解决方案，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Modern on-device neural network applications must operate under resource
constraints while adapting to unpredictable domain shifts. However, this
combined challenge-model compression and domain adaptation-remains largely
unaddressed, as prior work has tackled each issue in isolation: compressed
networks prioritize efficiency within a fixed domain, whereas large, capable
models focus on handling domain shifts. In this work, we propose CoDA, a
frequency composition-based framework that unifies compression and domain
adaptation. During training, CoDA employs quantization-aware training (QAT)
with low-frequency components, enabling a compressed model to selectively learn
robust, generalizable features. At test time, it refines the compact model in a
source-free manner (i.e., test-time adaptation, TTA), leveraging the
full-frequency information from incoming data to adapt to target domains while
treating high-frequency components as domain-specific cues. LFC are aligned
with the trained distribution, while HFC unique to the target distribution are
solely utilized for batch normalization. CoDA can be integrated synergistically
into existing QAT and TTA methods. CoDA is evaluated on widely used
domain-shift benchmarks, including CIFAR10-C and ImageNet-C, across various
model architectures. With significant compression, it achieves accuracy
improvements of 7.96%p on CIFAR10-C and 5.37%p on ImageNet-C over the
full-precision TTA baseline.

Result: 在R2R基准测试中取得最优性能，且参数量更少。

Conclusion: ATD通过语言形式的自适应想象，实现了高效可靠的导航策略，为VLN任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires the agent to navigate by
following natural instructions under partial observability, making it difficult
to align perception with language. Recent methods mitigate this by imagining
future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high
computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively
imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more
reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive
Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a
large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain
architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the
right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To
achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently
activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of
logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce
a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject
them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the
reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We
conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves
state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. The code is

Abstract: Transparent and reflective objects pose significant challenges for depth

downstream robotic perception and manipulation tasks. To address this issue, we
propose HTMNet, a novel hybrid model integrating Transformer, CNN, and Mamba
architectures. The encoder is constructed based on a dual-branch
Transformer-CNN framework, while the multi-scale fusion module leverages a
Transformer-Mamba architecture, which also serves as the foundation for the
decoder design. We introduce a novel multimodal fusion module grounded in
self-attention mechanisms and state space models, marking the first application
of the Mamba architecture in the field of transparent object depth completion
and revealing its promising potential. Additionally, we design an innovative
multi-scale fusion module for the decoder that combines channel attention,
spatial attention, and multi-scale feature extraction techniques to effectively
integrate multi-scale features through a down-fusion strategy. Extensive

state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance, validating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Conclusion: DGAD通过解耦几何和外观处理，为通用对象组合提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: General object composition (GOC) aims to seamlessly integrate a target object
into a background scene with desired geometric properties, while simultaneously
preserving its fine-grained appearance details. Recent approaches derive
semantic embeddings and integrate them into advanced diffusion models to enable
geometry-editable generation. However, these highly compact embeddings encode
only high-level semantic cues and inevitably discard fine-grained appearance
details. We introduce a Disentangled Geometry-editable and
Appearance-preserving Diffusion (DGAD) model that first leverages semantic
embeddings to implicitly capture the desired geometric transformations and then
employs a cross-attention retrieval mechanism to align fine-grained appearance
features with the geometry-edited representation, facilitating both precise
geometry editing and faithful appearance preservation in object composition.
Specifically, DGAD builds on CLIP/DINO-derived and reference networks to
extract semantic embeddings and appearance-preserving representations, which
are then seamlessly integrated into the encoding and decoding pipelines in a
disentangled manner. We first integrate the semantic embeddings into
pre-trained diffusion models that exhibit strong spatial reasoning capabilities
to implicitly capture object geometry, thereby facilitating flexible object
manipulation and ensuring effective editability. Then, we design a dense
cross-attention mechanism that leverages the implicitly learned object geometry
to retrieve and spatially align appearance features with their corresponding
regions, ensuring faithful appearance consistency. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DGAD framework.

Abstract: We present HuMoCon, a novel motion-video understanding framework designed for

key challenges in motion concept discovery for understanding and reasoning,
including the lack of explicit multi-modality feature alignment and the loss of
high-frequency information in masked autoencoding frameworks. Our approach
integrates a feature alignment strategy that leverages video for contextual

Abstract: Improving label quality in medical image segmentation is costly, but its

improve in-domain performance, gains remain unclear if below a small threshold.
For pre-training, label quality has minimal impact, suggesting that models
rather transfer general concepts than detailed annotations. These findings
provide guidance on when improving label quality is worth the effort.

Result: QwT-v2在减少额外开销的同时，精度与QwT相当或更高，且兼容大多数硬件平台。

Conclusion: QwT-v2是一种高效、兼容性强的网络量化改进方法。

Abstract: Network quantization is arguably one of the most practical network
compression approaches for reducing the enormous resource consumption of modern
deep neural networks. They usually require diverse and subtle design choices
for specific architecture and tasks. Instead, the QwT method is a simple and
general approach which introduces lightweight additional structures to improve
quantization. But QwT incurs extra parameters and latency. More importantly,
QwT is not compatible with many hardware platforms. In this paper, we propose
QwT-v2, which not only enjoys all advantages of but also resolves major defects
of QwT. By adopting a very lightweight channel-wise affine compensation (CWAC)
module, QwT-v2 introduces significantly less extra parameters and computations
compared to QwT, and at the same time matches or even outperforms QwT in
accuracy. The compensation module of QwT-v2 can be integrated into quantization
inference engines with little effort, which not only effectively removes the
extra costs but also makes it compatible with most existing hardware platforms.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的方法ISAC，通过实例优先建模解决多实例场景中对象合并或遗漏的问题，显著提高了多类和多实例准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在多实例场景中表现不佳，容易合并或遗漏对象，而现有方法缺乏对实例个体化的处理。

Method: ISAC采用实例优先建模方法，结合层次化树状提示机制，解耦多对象实例并分别对齐语义标签。

Result: ISAC在无需外部模型的情况下，实现了52%的多类平均准确率和83%的多实例平均准确率。

Conclusion: ISAC通过实例解耦和语义对齐，显著提升了多实例场景的生成效果。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating single-instance scenes but
struggle with multi-instance scenarios, often merging or omitting objects.
Unlike previous training-free approaches that rely solely on semantic-level
guidance without addressing instance individuation, our training-free method,
Instance-to-Semantic Attention Control (ISAC), explicitly resolves incomplete
instance formation and semantic entanglement through an instance-first modeling
approach. This enables ISAC to effectively leverage a hierarchical,
tree-structured prompt mechanism, disentangling multiple object instances and
individually aligning them with their corresponding semantic labels. Without
employing any external models, ISAC achieves up to 52% average multi-class
accuracy and 83% average multi-instance accuracy by effectively forming
disentangled instances. The code will be made available upon publication.

TLDR: 提出Point Mamba Adapter（PMA），通过整合预训练模型中间层的互补信息，提升点云理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅利用预训练模型的最终输出，忽略了中间层的丰富信息，未能充分发挥预训练模型的潜力。

Method: PMA构建有序特征序列，利用Mamba融合多层级语义；提出G2PG动态优化空间顺序。

Result: 在多个点云数据集上的实验表明，PMA通过融合中间层特征显著提升了点云理解能力。

Conclusion: PMA通过有效整合多层级信息，将点云理解能力提升至新水平。

Abstract: Applying pre-trained models to assist point cloud understanding has recently
become a mainstream paradigm in 3D perception. However, existing application
strategies are straightforward, utilizing only the final output of the
pre-trained model for various task heads. It neglects the rich complementary
information in the intermediate layer, thereby failing to fully unlock the
potential of pre-trained models. To overcome this limitation, we propose an
orthogonal solution: Point Mamba Adapter (PMA), which constructs an ordered
feature sequence from all layers of the pre-trained model and leverages Mamba
to fuse all complementary semantics, thereby promoting comprehensive point
cloud understanding. Constructing this ordered sequence is non-trivial due to
the inherent isotropy of 3D space. Therefore, we further propose a
geometry-constrained gate prompt generator (G2PG) shared across different
layers, which applies shared geometric constraints to the output gates of the
Mamba and dynamically optimizes the spatial order, thus enabling more effective
integration of multi-layer information. Extensive experiments conducted on
challenging point cloud datasets across various tasks demonstrate that our PMA
elevates the capability for point cloud understanding to a new level by fusing
diverse complementary intermediate features. Code is available at

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，DSOcc在基于相机的方法中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DSOcc通过深度和语义信息有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了3D语义占用预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an efficient and
cost-effective solution for perceiving surrounding scenes in autonomous
driving. However, existing works rely on explicit occupancy state inference,
leading to numerous incorrect feature assignments, and insufficient samples
restrict the learning of occupancy class inference. To address these
challenges, we propose leveraging Depth awareness and Semantic aid to boost
camera-based 3D semantic Occupancy prediction (DSOcc). We jointly perform
occupancy state and occupancy class inference, where soft occupancy confidence
is calculated through non-learning method and multiplied with image features to
make the voxel representation aware of depth, enabling adaptive implicit
occupancy state inference. Rather than focusing on improving feature learning,
we directly utilize well-trained image semantic segmentation and fuse multiple
frames with their occupancy probabilities to aid occupancy class inference,
thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DSOcc
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset among
camera-based methods.

Result: 在自建数据集上验证了OrienText的有效性，并优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OrienText显著提升了文本在复杂表面上的生成质量。

Abstract: Textual content in images is crucial in e-commerce sectors, particularly in
marketing campaigns, product imaging, advertising, and the entertainment
industry. Current text-to-image (T2I) generation diffusion models, though
proficient at producing high-quality images, often struggle to incorporate text
accurately onto complex surfaces with varied perspectives, such as angled views
of architectural elements like buildings, banners, or walls. In this paper, we
introduce the Surface Oriented Textual Image Generation (OrienText) method,
which leverages region-specific surface normals as conditional input to T2I
generation diffusion model. Our approach ensures accurate rendering and correct
orientation of the text within the image context. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the OrienText method on a self-curated dataset of images and
compare it against the existing textual image generation methods.

Conclusion: RF4D通过雷达和时间建模，显著提升了动态户外场景的新视角合成性能，为恶劣环境下的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Neural fields (NFs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in scene
reconstruction, powering various tasks such as novel view synthesis. However,
existing NF methods relying on RGB or LiDAR inputs often exhibit severe
fragility to adverse weather, particularly when applied in outdoor scenarios
like autonomous driving. In contrast, millimeter-wave radar is inherently
robust to environmental changes, while unfortunately, its integration with NFs
remains largely underexplored. Besides, as outdoor driving scenarios frequently
involve moving objects, making spatiotemporal modeling essential for temporally
consistent novel view synthesis. To this end, we introduce RF4D, a radar-based
neural field framework specifically designed for novel view synthesis in
outdoor dynamic scenes. RF4D explicitly incorporates temporal information into
its representation, significantly enhancing its capability to model moving
objects. We further introduce a feature-level flow module that predicts latent
temporal offsets between adjacent frames, enforcing temporal coherence in
dynamic scene modeling. Moreover, we propose a radar-specific power rendering
formulation closely aligned with radar sensing physics, improving synthesis
accuracy and interoperability. Extensive experiments on public radar datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RF4D in terms of radar measurement
synthesis quality and occupancy estimation accuracy, achieving especially
pronounced improvements in dynamic outdoor scenarios.

Abstract: Personalized diffusion models have shown remarkable success in Text-to-Image
(T2I) generation by enabling the injection of user-defined concepts into
diverse contexts. However, balancing concept fidelity with contextual alignment
remains a challenging open problem. In this work, we propose an RL-based
approach that leverages the diverse outputs of T2I models to address this
issue. Our method eliminates the need for human-annotated scores by generating
a synthetic paired dataset for DPO-like training using external quality
metrics. These better-worse pairs are specifically constructed to improve both
concept fidelity and prompt adherence. Moreover, our approach supports flexible
adjustment of the trade-off between image fidelity and textual alignment.
Through multi-step training, our approach outperforms a naive baseline in
convergence speed and output quality. We conduct extensive qualitative and

Result: 实验表明，直接使用现成VLM效果不佳，场景挖掘具有独特挑战。

Conclusion: RefAV为场景挖掘提供了新方法，但需进一步优化VLM以适应此类任务。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) collect and pseudo-label terabytes of multi-modal
data localized to HD maps during normal fleet testing. However, identifying
interesting and safety-critical scenarios from uncurated driving logs remains a
significant challenge. Traditional scenario mining techniques are error-prone
and prohibitively time-consuming, often relying on hand-crafted structured
queries. In this work, we revisit spatio-temporal scenario mining through the
lens of recent vision-language models (VLMs) to detect whether a described
scenario occurs in a driving log and, if so, precisely localize it in both time
and space. To address this problem, we introduce RefAV, a large-scale dataset
of 10,000 diverse natural language queries that describe complex multi-agent
interactions relevant to motion planning derived from 1000 driving logs in the
Argoverse 2 Sensor dataset. We evaluate several referential multi-object
trackers and present an empirical analysis of our baselines. Notably, we find
that naively repurposing off-the-shelf VLMs yields poor performance, suggesting
that scenario mining presents unique challenges. Our code and dataset are

Motivation: 计算机视觉应用中处理大量包含个人信息的视觉数据时，隐私保护成为重要问题。现有隐私法规要求个人数据处理需获得同意，限制了高质量数据集的收集。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 使用RetinaNet进行面部检测；2) 使用VGG-Face提取特征；3) 利用BrushNet扩散模型生成自然且不可识别的面部图像。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练GAN，通过扩散模型实现了高效且隐私保护的面部匿名化。

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of computer vision applications necessitates
handling vast amounts of visual data, often containing personal information.
While this technology offers significant benefits, it should not compromise
privacy. Data privacy regulations emphasize the need for individual consent for
processing personal data, hindering researchers' ability to collect
high-quality datasets containing the faces of the individuals. This paper
presents a deep learning-based face anonymization pipeline to overcome this
challenge. Unlike most of the existing methods, our method leverages recent
advancements in diffusion-based inpainting models, eliminating the need for
training Generative Adversarial Networks. The pipeline employs a three-stage
approach: face detection with RetinaNet, feature extraction with VGG-Face, and
realistic face generation using the state-of-the-art BrushNet diffusion model.
BrushNet utilizes the entire image, face masks, and text prompts specifying
desired facial attributes like age, ethnicity, gender, and expression. This
enables the generation of natural-looking images with unrecognizable
individuals, facilitating the creation of privacy-compliant datasets for
computer vision research.

Motivation: 现实应用中，客户端数据多为无标签且存在领域偏移，传统SSFL假设数据分布相同，限制了实用性。

Method: 提出UAP框架，包括服务器模型训练和客户端特征对齐两阶段，无需额外通信开销。

Result: 在标准领域泛化基准数据集上，UAP实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: UAP有效提升了SSFL在领域偏移下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (SSFL) is gaining popularity over
conventional Federated Learning in many real-world applications. Due to the
practical limitation of limited labeled data on the client side, SSFL considers
that participating clients train with unlabeled data, and only the central
server has the necessary resources to access limited labeled data, making it an
ideal fit for real-world applications (e.g., healthcare). However, traditional
SSFL assumes that the data distributions in the training phase and testing
phase are the same. In practice, however, domain shifts frequently occur,
making it essential for SSFL to incorporate generalization capabilities and
enhance their practicality. The core challenge is improving model
generalization to new, unseen domains while the client participate in SSFL.
However, the decentralized setup of SSFL and unsupervised client training
necessitates innovation to achieve improved generalization across domains. To
achieve this, we propose a novel framework called the Unified Alignment
Protocol (UAP), which consists of an alternating two-stage training process.
The first stage involves training the server model to learn and align the
features with a parametric distribution, which is subsequently communicated to
clients without additional communication overhead. The second stage proposes a
novel training algorithm that utilizes the server feature distribution to align
client features accordingly. Our extensive experiments on standard domain
generalization benchmark datasets across multiple model architectures reveal
that proposed UAP successfully achieves SOTA generalization performance in SSFL
setting.

Abstract: Internal representations are crucial for understanding deep neural networks,
such as their properties and reasoning patterns, but remain difficult to
interpret. While mapping from feature space to input space aids in interpreting
the former, existing approaches often rely on crude approximations. We propose
using a conditional diffusion model - a pretrained high-fidelity diffusion
model conditioned on spatially resolved feature maps - to learn such a mapping
in a probabilistic manner. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach
across various pretrained image classifiers from CNNs to ViTs, showing
excellent reconstruction capabilities. Through qualitative comparisons and
robustness analysis, we validate our method and showcase possible applications,
such as the visualization of concept steering in input space or investigations
of the composite nature of the feature space. This approach has broad potential
for improving feature space understanding in computer vision models.

Abstract: Video generation using diffusion models is highly computationally intensive,
with 3D attention in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models accounting for over
80\% of the total computational resources. In this work, we introduce {\bf
RainFusion}, a novel training-free sparse attention method that exploits
inherent sparsity nature in visual data to accelerate attention computation

determined online with negligible overhead (\textasciitilde\,0.2\%) with our
proposed {\bf ARM} (Adaptive Recognition Module) during inference. Our proposed
{\bf RainFusion} is a plug-and-play method, that can be seamlessly integrated

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了坑洞检测和面积估计的精度与鲁棒性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Road potholes pose a serious threat to driving safety and comfort, making
their detection and assessment a critical task in fields such as autonomous
driving. When driving vehicles, the operators usually avoid large potholes and
approach smaller ones at reduced speeds to ensure safety. Therefore, accurately
estimating pothole area is of vital importance. Most existing vision-based
methods rely on distance priors to construct geometric models. However, their
performance is susceptible to variations in camera angles and typically relies
on the assumption of a flat road surface, potentially leading to significant
errors in complex real-world environments. To address these problems, a robust
pothole area estimation framework that integrates object detection and
monocular depth estimation in a video stream is proposed in this paper. First,
to enhance pothole feature extraction and improve the detection of small
potholes, ACSH-YOLOv8 is proposed with ACmix module and the small object
detection head. Then, the BoT-SORT algorithm is utilized for pothole tracking,
while DepthAnything V2 generates depth maps for each frame. With the obtained
depth maps and potholes labels, a novel Minimum Bounding Triangulated Pixel
(MBTP) method is proposed for pothole area estimation. Finally, Kalman Filter
based on Confidence and Distance (CDKF) is developed to maintain consistency of
estimation results across consecutive frames. The results show that ACSH-YOLOv8
model achieves an AP(50) of 76.6%, representing a 7.6% improvement over YOLOv8.
Through CDKF optimization across consecutive frames, pothole predictions become
more robust, thereby enhancing the method's practical applicability.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了3D生成中的一致性问题，为联合生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the availability of large-scale 3D datasets and advancements in 3D
generative models, the complexity and uneven quality of 3D geometry and texture
data continue to hinder the performance of 3D generation techniques. In most
existing approaches, 3D geometry and texture are generated in separate stages
using different models and non-unified representations, frequently leading to
unsatisfactory coherence between geometry and texture. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for joint generation of 3D geometry
and texture. Specifically, we focus in generate a versatile 2.5D
representations that can be seamlessly transformed between 2D and 3D. Our
approach begins by integrating multiview RGB, normal, and coordinate images
into a unified representation, termed as 2.5D latents. Next, we adapt
pre-trained 2D foundation models for high-fidelity 2.5D generation, utilizing
both text and image conditions. Finally, we introduce a lightweight 2.5D-to-3D
refiner-decoder framework that efficiently generates detailed 3D
representations from 2.5D images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model not only excels in generating high-quality 3D objects with coherent
structure and color from text and image inputs but also significantly
outperforms existing methods in geometry-conditioned texture generation.

Result: 在质量和多视角一致性上优于现有方法，且速度更快。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、高质量地实现了3D场景风格化，同时保持多视角一致性。

Abstract: Stylizing 3D scenes instantly while maintaining multi-view consistency and
faithfully resembling a style image remains a significant challenge. Current
state-of-the-art 3D stylization methods typically involve computationally
intensive test-time optimization to transfer artistic features into a
pretrained 3D representation, often requiring dense posed input images. In
contrast, leveraging recent advances in feed-forward reconstruction models, we
demonstrate a novel approach to achieve direct 3D stylization in less than a
second using unposed sparse-view scene images and an arbitrary style image. To
address the inherent decoupling between reconstruction and stylization, we
introduce a branched architecture that separates structure modeling and
appearance shading, effectively preventing stylistic transfer from distorting
the underlying 3D scene structure. Furthermore, we adapt an identity loss to
facilitate pre-training our stylization model through the novel view synthesis
task. This strategy also allows our model to retain its original reconstruction
capabilities while being fine-tuned for stylization. Comprehensive evaluations,
using both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, demonstrate that our approach
produces high-quality stylized 3D content that achieve a superior blend of
style and scene appearance, while also outperforming existing methods in terms
of multi-view consistency and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RLHF和DPO容易过拟合文本信息或加剧幻觉，而负样本增强仅部分解决问题，缺乏列表偏好优化的应用。

Method: LPOI通过掩码图像中的关键对象，并在正负样本间插值生成渐进图像序列，训练模型按对象可见性排序。

Result: 在MMHalBench、AMBER和Object HalBench上的实验表明，LPOI在减少幻觉和提升VLM性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LPOI无需额外标注，通过对象掩码和插值自动构建排序列表，有效减少幻觉并保持视觉保真度。

Abstract: Aligning large VLMs with human preferences is a challenging task, as methods
like RLHF and DPO often overfit to textual information or exacerbate
hallucinations. Although augmenting negative image samples partially addresses
these pitfalls, no prior work has employed listwise preference optimization for
VLMs, due to the complexity and cost of constructing listwise image samples. In
this work, we propose LPOI, the first object-aware listwise preference
optimization developed for reducing hallucinations in VLMs. LPOI identifies and
masks a critical object in the image, and then interpolates the masked region
between the positive and negative images to form a sequence of incrementally
more complete images. The model is trained to rank these images in ascending
order of object visibility, effectively reducing hallucinations while retaining
visual fidelity. LPOI requires no extra annotations beyond standard pairwise
preference data, as it automatically constructs the ranked lists through object
masking and interpolation. Comprehensive experiments on MMHalBench, AMBER, and
Object HalBench confirm that LPOI outperforms existing preference optimization
methods in reducing hallucinations and enhancing VLM performance. We make the
code available at https://github.com/fatemehpesaran310/lpoi.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为TEMU-VTOFF的新架构，用于解决虚拟试脱（VTOFF）任务中的两大挑战：服装特征与遮挡和复杂姿态的解耦，以及多类别服装的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟试脱（VTOFF）任务旨在从穿着服装的个体照片中生成标准化的服装产品图像，但现有方法在解耦服装特征和泛化多类别服装方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出TEMU-VTOFF架构，采用双DiT主干和修改的多模态注意力机制，结合图像、文本和掩码等多模态输入，并引入对齐模块以优化生成细节。

Result: 在VITON-HD和Dress Code数据集上的实验表明，TEMU-VTOFF在视觉质量和服装保真度方面均达到新的最优水平。

Conclusion: TEMU-VTOFF为VTOFF任务提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了生成图像的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: While virtual try-on (VTON) systems aim to render a garment onto a target
person image, this paper tackles the novel task of virtual try-off (VTOFF),
which addresses the inverse problem: generating standardized product images of
garments from real-world photos of clothed individuals. Unlike VTON, which must
resolve diverse pose and style variations, VTOFF benefits from a consistent and
well-defined output format -- typically a flat, lay-down-style representation
of the garment -- making it a promising tool for data generation and dataset
enhancement. However, existing VTOFF approaches face two major limitations: (i)
difficulty in disentangling garment features from occlusions and complex poses,
often leading to visual artifacts, and (ii) restricted applicability to
single-category garments (e.g., upper-body clothes only), limiting
generalization. To address these challenges, we present Text-Enhanced
MUlti-category Virtual Try-Off (TEMU-VTOFF), a novel architecture featuring a
dual DiT-based backbone with a modified multimodal attention mechanism for
robust garment feature extraction. Our architecture is designed to receive
garment information from multiple modalities like images, text, and masks to
work in a multi-category setting. Finally, we propose an additional alignment
module to further refine the generated visual details. Experiments on VITON-HD
and Dress Code datasets show that TEMU-VTOFF sets a new state-of-the-art on the
VTOFF task, significantly improving both visual quality and fidelity to the
target garments.

TLDR: 提出DualParal方法，通过并行化帧和模型层分布到多GPU，结合块式去噪和特征缓存，显著降低长视频生成的延迟和内存成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DiT视频扩散模型在生成长视频时的高延迟和内存消耗问题。

Method: 采用分布式推理策略DualParal，并行处理帧和模型层，结合块式去噪、特征缓存和协调噪声初始化。

Result: 在8×RTX 4090 GPU上，生成1,025帧视频时延迟降低6.54倍，内存成本降低1.48倍。

Conclusion: DualParal方法实现了高效、无伪影的无限长视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based video diffusion models generate
high-quality videos at scale but incur prohibitive processing latency and
memory costs for long videos. To address this, we propose a novel distributed
inference strategy, termed DualParal. The core idea is that, instead of
generating an entire video on a single GPU, we parallelize both temporal frames
and model layers across GPUs. However, a naive implementation of this division
faces a key limitation: since diffusion models require synchronized noise
levels across frames, this implementation leads to the serialization of
original parallelisms. We leverage a block-wise denoising scheme to handle
this. Namely, we process a sequence of frame blocks through the pipeline with
progressively decreasing noise levels. Each GPU handles a specific block and
layer subset while passing previous results to the next GPU, enabling
asynchronous computation and communication. To further optimize performance, we
incorporate two key enhancements. Firstly, a feature cache is implemented on
each GPU to store and reuse features from the prior block as context,
minimizing inter-GPU communication and redundant computation. Secondly, we
employ a coordinated noise initialization strategy, ensuring globally
consistent temporal dynamics by sharing initial noise patterns across GPUs
without extra resource costs. Together, these enable fast, artifact-free, and
infinitely long video generation. Applied to the latest diffusion transformer
video generator, our method efficiently produces 1,025-frame videos with up to
6.54$\times$ lower latency and 1.48$\times$ lower memory cost on 8$\times$RTX
4090 GPUs.

Motivation: 现有模型在长期地球观测分析中表现有限，主要集中于单时相或双时相影像，无法满足长期城市动态分析的需求。

Method: DVL-Suite包含15,063张高分辨率多时相影像，覆盖42个美国大城市，分为DVL-Bench（7个城市理解任务）和DVL-Instruct（指令调优数据集），并开发了基线模型DVLChat。

Result: 评估了17个先进多模态大语言模型，发现其在长期时间理解和定量分析方面的局限性。DVLChat能够通过语言交互实现图像级问答和像素级分割。

Conclusion: DVL-Suite填补了长期城市动态分析的空白，并通过DVLChat展示了多模态模型在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
visual understanding, but their application to long-term Earth observation
analysis remains limited, primarily focusing on single-temporal or bi-temporal
imagery. To address this gap, we introduce DVL-Suite, a comprehensive framework
for analyzing long-term urban dynamics through remote sensing imagery. Our
suite comprises 15,063 high-resolution (1.0m) multi-temporal images spanning 42
megacities in the U.S. from 2005 to 2023, organized into two components:
DVL-Bench and DVL-Instruct. The DVL-Bench includes seven urban understanding
tasks, from fundamental change detection (pixel-level) to quantitative analyses
(regional-level) and comprehensive urban narratives (scene-level), capturing
diverse urban dynamics including expansion/transformation patterns, disaster
assessment, and environmental challenges. We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art
multimodal large language models and reveal their limitations in long-term
temporal understanding and quantitative analysis. These challenges motivate the
creation of DVL-Instruct, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset designed to
enhance models' capabilities in multi-temporal Earth observation. Building upon
this dataset, we develop DVLChat, a baseline model capable of both image-level
question-answering and pixel-level segmentation, facilitating a comprehensive
understanding of city dynamics through language interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常仅使用有限3D模态，导致场景表示不完整和解释准确性降低，且不同查询依赖不同模态，统一处理效果不佳。

Method: Uni3D-MoE整合多种3D模态（如RGB、深度图像、BEV地图、点云和体素表示），通过稀疏MoE模型中的可学习路由机制动态选择专家，每个专家专长于处理特定模态。

Result: 在标准3D场景理解基准和专用数据集上的广泛评估验证了Uni3D-MoE的有效性。

Conclusion: Uni3D-MoE通过自适应多模态融合显著提升了3D场景理解的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated considerable potential for comprehensive 3D scene understanding.
However, existing approaches typically utilize only one or a limited subset of
3D modalities, resulting in incomplete representations of 3D scenes and reduced
interpretive accuracy. Furthermore, different types of queries inherently
depend on distinct modalities, indicating that uniform processing of all
modality tokens may fail to effectively capture query-specific context. To
address these challenges, we propose Uni3D-MoE, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE)-based 3D MLLM designed to enable adaptive 3D multimodal fusion.
Specifically, Uni3D-MoE integrates a comprehensive set of 3D modalities,
including multi-view RGB and depth images, bird's-eye-view (BEV) maps, point
clouds, and voxel representations. At its core, our framework employs a
learnable routing mechanism within the sparse MoE-based large language model,
dynamically selecting appropriate experts at the token level. Each expert
specializes in processing multimodal tokens based on learned modality
preferences, thus facilitating flexible collaboration tailored to diverse
task-specific requirements. Extensive evaluations on standard 3D scene
understanding benchmarks and specialized datasets demonstrate the efficacy of
Uni3D-MoE.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂灾害场景（如多样灾害类型、地理区域和卫星传感器）中表现不佳，亟需专用数据集支持。

Method: 构建了包含26,988对双时相卫星图像和123k指令对的DisasterM3数据集，涵盖多灾害、多传感器和多任务特点，并评估了14种VLM模型。

Result: 现有模型在灾害任务中表现不佳，但通过DisasterM3微调的四种VLM模型在所有任务中均取得稳定提升，并具备跨传感器和跨灾害的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DisasterM3为灾害场景下的VLM应用提供了有效支持，未来可进一步优化模型性能。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made great achievements in Earth
vision. However, complex disaster scenes with diverse disaster types,
geographic regions, and satellite sensors have posed new challenges for VLM
applications. To fill this gap, we curate a remote sensing vision-language
dataset (DisasterM3) for global-scale disaster assessment and response.
DisasterM3 includes 26,988 bi-temporal satellite images and 123k instruction
pairs across 5 continents, with three characteristics: 1) Multi-hazard:
DisasterM3 involves 36 historical disaster events with significant impacts,
which are categorized into 10 common natural and man-made disasters.
2)Multi-sensor: Extreme weather during disasters often hinders optical sensor
imaging, making it necessary to combine Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery
for post-disaster scenes. 3) Multi-task: Based on real-world scenarios,
DisasterM3 includes 9 disaster-related visual perception and reasoning tasks,
harnessing the full potential of VLM's reasoning ability with progressing from
disaster-bearing body recognition to structural damage assessment and object
relational reasoning, culminating in the generation of long-form disaster
reports. We extensively evaluated 14 generic and remote sensing VLMs on our
benchmark, revealing that state-of-the-art models struggle with the disaster
tasks, largely due to the lack of a disaster-specific corpus, cross-sensor gap,
and damage object counting insensitivity. Focusing on these issues, we
fine-tune four VLMs using our dataset and achieve stable improvements across
all tasks, with robust cross-sensor and cross-disaster generalization
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像超分辨率训练中需要大量计算和存储资源的问题，同时探索数据集压缩在ISR领域的潜力。

Method: 采用随机局部傅里叶特征提取和多级特征分布匹配，优化全局和局部特征分布，生成高质量合成训练数据。

Result: 压缩后的数据集（10%数据量）在训练多种ISR模型时表现接近或优于原始数据集，且训练稳定性良好。

Conclusion: IDC框架首次在ISR领域实现了高效数据压缩，为资源受限场景提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning based image Super-Resolution (ISR) relies on large training
datasets to optimize model generalization; this requires substantial
computational and storage resources during training. While dataset condensation
has shown potential in improving data efficiency and privacy for high-level
computer vision tasks, it has not yet been fully exploited for ISR. In this
paper, we propose a novel Instance Data Condensation (IDC) framework
specifically for ISR, which achieves instance-level data condensation through
Random Local Fourier Feature Extraction and Multi-level Feature Distribution
Matching. This aims to optimize feature distributions at both global and local
levels and obtain high-quality synthesized training content with fine detail.
This framework has been utilized to condense the most commonly used training
dataset for ISR, DIV2K, with a 10% condensation rate. The resulting synthetic
dataset offers comparable or (in certain cases) even better performance
compared to the original full dataset and excellent training stability when
used to train various popular ISR models. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first time that a condensed/synthetic dataset (with a 10% data volume) has
demonstrated such performance. The source code and the synthetic dataset have
been made available at https://github.com/.

Result: 新求解器在10步内使SiT-XL/2和FlowDCN-XL/2的FID分别达2.40和2.35，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 搜索的求解器在多种模型架构和分辨率中表现优异，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation quality but at the
cost of numerous function evaluations. Recently, advanced ODE-based solvers
have been developed to mitigate the substantial computational demands of
reverse-diffusion solving under limited sampling steps. However, these solvers,
heavily inspired by Adams-like multistep methods, rely solely on t-related
Lagrange interpolation. We show that t-related Lagrange interpolation is
suboptimal for diffusion model and reveal a compact search space comprised of
time steps and solver coefficients. Building on our analysis, we propose a
novel differentiable solver search algorithm to identify more optimal solver.
Equipped with the searched solver, rectified-flow models, e.g., SiT-XL/2 and
FlowDCN-XL/2, achieve FID scores of 2.40 and 2.35, respectively, on ImageNet256
with only 10 steps. Meanwhile, DDPM model, DiT-XL/2, reaches a FID score of
2.33 with only 10 steps. Notably, our searched solver outperforms traditional
solvers by a significant margin. Moreover, our searched solver demonstrates
generality across various model architectures, resolutions, and model sizes.

Abstract: The task of reassembly is a significant challenge across multiple domains,
including archaeology, genomics, and molecular docking, requiring the precise
placement and orientation of elements to reconstruct an original structure. In
this work, we address key limitations in state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods
for reassembly, namely i) scalability; ii) multimodality; and iii) real-world
applicability: beyond square or simple geometric shapes, realistic and complex
erosion, or other real-world problems. We propose ReassembleNet, a method that
reduces complexity by representing each input piece as a set of contour
keypoints and learning to select the most informative ones by Graph Neural
Networks pooling inspired techniques. ReassembleNet effectively lowers
computational complexity while enabling the integration of features from
multiple modalities, including both geometric and texture data. Further
enhanced through pretraining on a semi-synthetic dataset. We then apply
diffusion-based pose estimation to recover the original structure. We improve
on prior methods by 55% and 86% for RMSE Rotation and Translation,
respectively.

Abstract: In latest years plethora of identity-preserving adapters for a personalized

that they are dominantly trained jointly with base diffusion models, which
suffer from slow multi-step inference. This work aims to tackle the challenge
of training-free adaptation of pretrained ID-adapters to diffusion models

mechanisms in decoupled blocks to improve identity similarity and fidelity, we

Motivation: 解决当前方法在复杂真实场景（如MVTec AD 2基准）中性能下降的问题。

Method: 1. Swin-Cropping预处理策略；2. 数据增强（噪声和光照模拟）；3. 结合传统统计二值化和MEBin的自适应二值化策略，并使用SAM优化分割结果。

Result: 在Test_private和Test_private_mixed上分别实现了29.2%和29.82%的SegF1提升。

Conclusion: RoBiS框架显著提升了无监督异常检测在复杂场景中的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Robust unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) in real-world scenarios is an
important task. Current methods exhibit severe performance degradation on the
MVTec AD 2 benchmark due to its complex real-world challenges. To solve this
problem, we propose a robust framework RoBiS, which consists of three core
modules: (1) Swin-Cropping, a high-resolution image pre-processing strategy to
preserve the information of small anomalies through overlapping window
cropping. (2) The data augmentation of noise addition and lighting simulation
is carried out on the training data to improve the robustness of AD model. We
use INP-Former as our baseline, which could generate better results on the
various sub-images. (3) The traditional statistical-based binarization strategy
(mean+3std) is combined with our previous work, MEBin (published in CVPR2025),
for joint adaptive binarization. Then, SAM is further employed to refine the
segmentation results. Compared with some methods reported by the MVTec AD 2,
our RoBiS achieves a 29.2% SegF1 improvement (from 21.8% to 51.00%) on
Test_private and 29.82% SegF1 gains (from 16.7% to 46.52%) on

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为NAG的高效、无需训练的负向引导方法，用于解决扩散模型中负向引导在少步采样中的失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在扩散模型中，负向引导（抑制不需要的属性）是一个基础挑战，尤其是在少步采样情况下。现有的Classifier-Free Guidance（CFG）在标准设置下表现良好，但在激进的采样步数压缩下会失效。

Method: NAG通过在注意力空间中使用L1归一化和精化的外推方法，实现了高效的负向引导。该方法无需训练，适用于多种架构、采样模式和模态。

Result: 实验表明，NAG在文本对齐（CLIP Score）、保真度（FID, PFID）和人类感知质量（ImageReward）方面均有显著提升。用户研究也证实了对NAG引导输出的明显偏好。

Conclusion: NAG作为一种模型无关的推理时方法，无需重新训练，为现代扩散框架提供了高效的负向引导解决方案。

Abstract: Negative guidance -- explicitly suppressing unwanted attributes -- remains a
fundamental challenge in diffusion models, particularly in few-step sampling
regimes. While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) works well in standard settings,
it fails under aggressive sampling step compression due to divergent
predictions between positive and negative branches. We present Normalized
Attention Guidance (NAG), an efficient, training-free mechanism that applies
extrapolation in attention space with L1-based normalization and refinement.
NAG restores effective negative guidance where CFG collapses while maintaining
fidelity. Unlike existing approaches, NAG generalizes across architectures
(UNet, DiT), sampling regimes (few-step, multi-step), and modalities (image,
video), functioning as a \textit{universal} plug-in with minimal computational
overhead. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate consistent
improvements in text alignment (CLIP Score), fidelity (FID, PFID), and
human-perceived quality (ImageReward). Our ablation studies validate each
design component, while user studies confirm significant preference for
NAG-guided outputs. As a model-agnostic inference-time approach requiring no
retraining, NAG provides effortless negative guidance for all modern diffusion
frameworks -- pseudocode in the Appendix!

Method: FSA框架包含两个关键技术：1) 高频增强（通过傅里叶变换和频率选择性放大）；2) 分层梯度融合（多尺度梯度分解与融合）。

Result: 实验表明，FSA在多种黑盒防御模型上均优于现有方法，攻击成功率平均提升23.6%。

Conclusion: FSA通过频域和空域的结合，显著提升了对抗攻击的效果，为黑盒防御模型的安全性提出了新的挑战。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have become a significant challenge in the security of
machine learning models, particularly in the context of black-box defense
strategies. Existing methods for enhancing adversarial transferability
primarily focus on the spatial domain. This paper presents Frequency-Space
Attack (FSA), a new adversarial attack framework that effectively integrates
frequency-domain and spatial-domain transformations. FSA combines two key
techniques: (1) High-Frequency Augmentation, which applies Fourier transform
with frequency-selective amplification to diversify inputs and emphasize the
critical role of high-frequency components in adversarial attacks, and (2)
Hierarchical-Gradient Fusion, which merges multi-scale gradient decomposition
and fusion to capture both global structures and fine-grained details,
resulting in smoother perturbations. Our experiment demonstrates that FSA
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various black-box
models. Notably, our proposed FSA achieves an average attack success rate
increase of 23.6% compared with BSR (CVPR 2024) on eight black-box defense
models.

Abstract: Event cameras offer high temporal resolution and power efficiency, making
them well-suited for edge AI applications. However, their high event rates
present challenges for data transmission and processing. Subsampling methods
provide a practical solution, but their effect on downstream visual tasks
remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically evaluate six
hardware-friendly subsampling methods using convolutional neural networks for
event video classification on various benchmark datasets. We hypothesize that
events from high-density regions carry more task-relevant information and are
therefore better suited for subsampling. To test this, we introduce a simple
causal density-based subsampling method, demonstrating improved classification
accuracy in sparse regimes. Our analysis further highlights key factors
affecting subsampling performance, including sensitivity to hyperparameters and
failure cases in scenarios with large event count variance. These findings
provide insights for utilization of hardware-efficient subsampling strategies
that balance data efficiency and task accuracy. The code for this paper will be
released at: https://github.com/hesamaraghi/event-camera-subsampling-methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
general-purpose robot control through natural language instructions. However,
their high inference cost-stemming from large-scale token computation and
autoregressive decoding-poses significant challenges for real-time deployment
and edge applications. While prior work has primarily focused on architectural
optimization, we take a different perspective by identifying a dual form of
redundancy in VLA models: (i) high similarity across consecutive action steps,
and (ii) substantial redundancy in visual tokens. Motivated by these
observations, we propose FlashVLA, the first training-free and plug-and-play
acceleration framework that enables action reuse in VLA models. FlashVLA
improves inference efficiency through a token-aware action reuse mechanism that
avoids redundant decoding across stable action steps, and an information-guided
visual token selection strategy that prunes low-contribution tokens. Extensive
experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that FlashVLA reduces FLOPs by 55.7%
and latency by 36.0%, with only a 0.7% drop in task success rate. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of FlashVLA in enabling lightweight, low-latency
VLA inference without retraining.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Sci-Fi的新框架，通过改进的机制实现起始帧和结束帧的对称约束，解决了现有方法中不对称控制导致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频帧插值中通过直接微调或忽略训练引入结束帧约束，但由于机制与起始帧相同且训练不足，导致控制强度不对称，影响生成效果。

Method: 提出Sci-Fi框架，采用轻量级模块EF-Net编码结束帧并扩展为时序自适应特征，以更强的注入机制实现对称约束。

Result: 实验证明Sci-Fi能生成更和谐的过渡帧，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Sci-Fi通过对称约束机制有效解决了帧插值中的不一致问题，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Frame inbetweening aims to synthesize intermediate video sequences
conditioned on the given start and end frames. Current state-of-the-art methods
mainly extend large-scale pre-trained Image-to-Video Diffusion models (I2V-DMs)
by incorporating end-frame constraints via directly fine-tuning or omitting
training. We identify a critical limitation in their design: Their injections
of the end-frame constraint usually utilize the same mechanism that originally
imposed the start-frame (single image) constraint. However, since the original
I2V-DMs are adequately trained for the start-frame condition in advance,
naively introducing the end-frame constraint by the same mechanism with much
less (even zero) specialized training probably can't make the end frame have a
strong enough impact on the intermediate content like the start frame. This
asymmetric control strength of the two frames over the intermediate content
likely leads to inconsistent motion or appearance collapse in generated frames.
To efficiently achieve symmetric constraints of start and end frames, we
propose a novel framework, termed Sci-Fi, which applies a stronger injection
for the constraint of a smaller training scale. Specifically, it deals with the
start-frame constraint as before, while introducing the end-frame constraint by
an improved mechanism. The new mechanism is based on a well-designed
lightweight module, named EF-Net, which encodes only the end frame and expands
it into temporally adaptive frame-wise features injected into the I2V-DM. This
makes the end-frame constraint as strong as the start-frame constraint,
enabling our Sci-Fi to produce more harmonious transitions in various
scenarios. Extensive experiments prove the superiority of our Sci-Fi compared
with other baselines.

Motivation: 传统欧几里得空间方法无法有效捕捉特征的层次关系，导致异常检测性能不佳。

Method: 将特征表示投影到双曲空间，基于置信度聚合特征，并分类为健康或异常样本。

Result: 双曲空间方法在多个医学基准数据集上表现优于欧几里得方法，AUROC分数更高，且对参数变化和少样本场景具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 双曲空间是医学异常检测的有力替代方案，具有潜力。

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection has emerged as a promising solution to challenges
in data availability and labeling constraints. Traditional methods extract
features from different layers of pre-trained networks in Euclidean space;
however, Euclidean representations fail to effectively capture the hierarchical
relationships within these features, leading to suboptimal anomaly detection
performance. We propose a novel yet simple approach that projects feature
representations into hyperbolic space, aggregates them based on confidence
levels, and classifies samples as healthy or anomalous. Our experiments
demonstrate that hyperbolic space consistently outperforms Euclidean-based
frameworks, achieving higher AUROC scores at both image and pixel levels across
multiple medical benchmark datasets. Additionally, we show that hyperbolic
space exhibits resilience to parameter variations and excels in few-shot
scenarios, where healthy images are scarce. These findings underscore the
potential of hyperbolic space as a powerful alternative for medical anomaly
detection. The project website can be found at

Motivation: 遮挡边界（OBE）和单目深度估计（MDE）相互促进，但现有方法未充分利用其协同作用。

Method: 提出MoDOT网络，结合CASM模块和OBDCL损失函数，联合估计深度和遮挡边界。

Result: 在合成数据集和NYUD-v2上达到SOTA，深度迁移效果媲美竞争对手。

Conclusion: 联合估计深度和遮挡边界有效，MoDOT设计显著提升性能，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Occlusion Boundary Estimation (OBE) identifies boundaries arising from both
inter-object occlusions and self-occlusion within individual objects,
distinguishing intrinsic object edges from occlusion-induced contours to
improve scene understanding and 3D reconstruction capacity. This is closely
related to Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE), which infers depth from a single
image, as occlusion boundaries provide critical geometric cues for resolving
depth ambiguities, while depth priors can conversely refine occlusion reasoning
in complex scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel network, MoDOT, that first
jointly estimates depth and OBs. We propose CASM, a cross-attention multi-scale
strip convolution module, leverages mid-level OB features to significantly
enhance depth prediction. Additionally, we introduce an occlusion-aware loss
function, OBDCL, which encourages sharper and more accurate depth boundaries.
Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the
mutual benefits of jointly estimating depth and OB, and highlight the
effectiveness of our model design. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) on both our proposed synthetic datasets and one popular real dataset,
NYUD-v2, significantly outperforming multi-task baselines. Besides, without
domain adaptation, results on real-world depth transfer are comparable to the
competitors, while preserving sharp occlusion boundaries for geometric
fidelity. We will release our code, pre-trained models, and datasets to support
future research in this direction.

Motivation: 现有VLM-based VQA方法处理整张图像导致冗余视觉令牌，增加计算和内存负担。

Method: CROP采用定位和剪枝两步：1) 定位相关区域；2) 通过PLC和ILP策略剪枝令牌。

Result: CROP在多种VQA任务中表现优异，超越现有剪枝方法。

Conclusion: CROP为视觉令牌压缩提供高效方案，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Current VLM-based VQA methods often process entire images, leading to
excessive visual tokens that include redundant information irrelevant to the
posed question. This abundance of unnecessary image details creates numerous
visual tokens, drastically increasing memory and computational requirements in
VLMs. To address this, we propose Contextual Region-Oriented Visual Token
Pruning (CROP), a novel framework to compress visual tokens through a two-step
process: Localization and Pruning. Specifically, CROP first employs an
efficient model to identify the contextual region relevant to the input query.
Subsequently, two distinct strategies are introduced for pruning: (1) Pre-LLM
Compression (PLC), which adaptively compresses different image regions with
varying ratios, and (2) Inner-LLM Pruning (ILP), a training-free method that
prunes tokens within early LLM layers guided by the identified contextual
region. Extensive experiments on a wide range of VQA tasks demonstrate that
CROP significantly outperforms existing visual token pruning methods and
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code and datasets will be made
available.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis for underwater scene reconstruction presents unique
challenges due to complex light-media interactions. Optical scattering and
absorption in water body bring inhomogeneous medium attenuation interference
that disrupts conventional volume rendering assumptions of uniform propagation
medium. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers real-time rendering
capabilities, it struggles with underwater inhomogeneous environments where
scattering media introduce artifacts and inconsistent appearance. In this
study, we propose a physics-based framework that disentangles object appearance
from water medium effects through tailored Gaussian modeling. Our approach
introduces appearance embeddings, which are explicit medium representations for
backscatter and attenuation, enhancing scene consistency. In addition, we
propose a distance-guided optimization strategy that leverages pseudo-depth
maps as supervision with depth regularization and scale penalty terms to
improve geometric fidelity. By integrating the proposed appearance and medium
modeling components via an underwater imaging model, our approach achieves both
high-quality novel view synthesis and physically accurate scene restoration.
Experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in rendering quality and
restoration accuracy over existing methods. The project page is available at

Abstract: We present Plenodium (plenoptic medium), an effective and efficient 3D
representation framework capable of jointly modeling both objects and
participating media. In contrast to existing medium representations that rely
solely on view-dependent modeling, our novel plenoptic medium representation
incorporates both directional and positional information through spherical
harmonics encoding, enabling highly accurate underwater scene reconstruction.
To address the initialization challenge in degraded underwater environments, we
propose the pseudo-depth Gaussian complementation to augment COLMAP-derived
point clouds with robust depth priors. In addition, a depth ranking regularized
loss is developed to optimize the geometry of the scene and improve the ordinal
consistency of the depth maps. Extensive experiments on real-world underwater
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in 3D
reconstruction. Furthermore, we conduct a simulated dataset with ground truth
and the controllable scattering medium to demonstrate the restoration
capability of our method in underwater scenarios. Our code and dataset are

Conclusion: DiMoSR验证了特征调制与注意力机制的互补作用，为高效网络设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Balancing reconstruction quality versus model efficiency remains a critical
challenge in lightweight single image super-resolution (SISR). Despite the
prevalence of attention mechanisms in recent state-of-the-art SISR approaches
that primarily emphasize or suppress feature maps, alternative architectural
paradigms warrant further exploration. This paper introduces DiMoSR (Dilated

representation through modulation to complement attention in lightweight SISR
networks. The proposed approach leverages multi-branch dilated convolutions to
capture rich contextual information over a wider receptive field while
maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that
DiMoSR outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight methods across diverse
benchmark datasets, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM metrics with comparable or
reduced computational complexity. Through comprehensive ablation studies, this
work not only validates the effectiveness of DiMoSR but also provides critical
insights into the interplay between attention mechanisms and feature modulation
to guide future research in efficient network design. The code and model

Method: 采用U-Net模型，结合监督学习和自监督学习（SSL）预训练，利用Sentinel-2图像在荷兰六个湿地区域进行训练。

Abstract: Accurate wetland land-cover classification is essential for environmental
monitoring, biodiversity assessment, and sustainable ecosystem management.
However, the scarcity of annotated data, especially for high-resolution
satellite imagery, poses a significant challenge for supervised learning
approaches. To tackle this issue, this study presents a methodology for wetland
land-cover segmentation and classification that adopts both supervised and
self-supervised learning (SSL). We train a U-Net model from scratch on
Sentinel-2 imagery across six wetland regions in the Netherlands, achieving a
baseline model accuracy of 85.26%.
  Addressing the limited availability of labeled data, the results show that
SSL pretraining with an autoencoder can improve accuracy, especially for the
high-resolution imagery where it is more difficult to obtain labeled data,
reaching an accuracy of 88.23%.
  Furthermore, we introduce a framework to scale manually annotated
high-resolution labels to medium-resolution inputs. While the quantitative
performance between resolutions is comparable, high-resolution imagery provides
significantly sharper segmentation boundaries and finer spatial detail.
  As part of this work, we also contribute a curated Sentinel-2 dataset with
Dynamic World labels, tailored for wetland classification tasks and made
publicly available.

Motivation: Transformer在3D姿态估计中因自注意力的二次复杂度导致计算成本高，且现有方法未能有效消除序列冗余。

Method: 引入SCT通过离散余弦变换压缩序列长度，提出LPG补充结构信息，并设计双流网络建模空间关系和运动轨迹。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上达到SOTA性能（如MPJPE 37.7mm），计算效率高。

Conclusion: SCT和LPG有效减少了冗余和计算成本，双流网络提升了性能，实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Abstract: Transformer-based 3D human pose estimation methods suffer from high
computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention with
respect to sequence length. Additionally, pose sequences often contain
significant redundancy between frames. However, recent methods typically fail
to improve model capacity while effectively eliminating sequence redundancy. In
this work, we introduce the Spectral Compression Transformer (SCT) to reduce
sequence length and accelerate computation. The SCT encoder treats hidden
features between blocks as Temporal Feature Signals (TFS) and applies the
Discrete Cosine Transform, a Fourier transform-based technique, to determine
the spectral components to be retained. By filtering out certain high-frequency
noise components, SCT compresses the sequence length and reduces redundancy. To
further enrich the input sequence with prior structural information, we propose
the Line Pose Graph (LPG) based on line graph theory. The LPG generates
skeletal position information that complements the input 2D joint positions,
thereby improving the model's performance. Finally, we design a dual-stream
network architecture to effectively model spatial joint relationships and the
compressed motion trajectory within the pose sequence. Extensive experiments on
two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved computational
efficiency. For example, on the Human3.6M dataset, our method achieves an MPJPE
of 37.7mm while maintaining a low computational cost. Furthermore, we perform
ablation studies on each module to assess its effectiveness. The code and
models will be released.

classification pipeline, merging MPN with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks,
achieves remarkable 93% accuracy while maintaining exceptional class-wise
balance. The perfect F1 score attained for our target class exemplifies
attention's power in adaptive feature refinement. For segmentation tasks, we
seamlessly integrate identical attention blocks within U-Net architecture using

Motivation: 现有视频虚拟试穿方法在时空一致性、服装细节重建和动态一致性方面存在局限，影响了试穿效果的真实性和稳定性。

Method: 采用扩散Transformer替代U-Net，结合全自注意力建模时空一致性；设计粗到细的服装保留策略，并在去噪阶段引入多条件；使用掩码感知损失优化服装区域保真度。

Conclusion: MagicTryOn通过改进架构和策略，显著提升了视频虚拟试穿的时空一致性和服装细节保留能力。

Abstract: Video Virtual Try-On (VVT) aims to simulate the natural appearance of
garments across consecutive video frames, capturing their dynamic variations
and interactions with human body motion. However, current VVT methods still
face challenges in terms of spatiotemporal consistency and garment content
preservation. First, they use diffusion models based on the U-Net, which are
limited in their expressive capability and struggle to reconstruct complex
details. Second, they adopt a separative modeling approach for spatial and
temporal attention, which hinders the effective capture of structural
relationships and dynamic consistency across frames. Third, their expression of
garment details remains insufficient, affecting the realism and stability of
the overall synthesized results, especially during human motion. To address the
above challenges, we propose MagicTryOn, a video virtual try-on framework built
upon the large-scale video diffusion Transformer.We replace the U-Net
architecture with a diffusion Transformer and combine full self-attention to
jointly model the spatiotemporal consistency of videos. We design a
coarse-to-fine garment preservation strategy. The coarse strategy integrates
garment tokens during the embedding stage, while the fine strategy incorporates
multiple garment-based conditions, such as semantics, textures, and contour
lines during the denoising stage. Moreover, we introduce a mask-aware loss to
further optimize garment region fidelity. Extensive experiments on both image
and video try-on datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SOTA
methods in comprehensive evaluations and generalizes to in-the-wild scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在静态图像OCR中表现良好，但在视频OCR中因运动模糊、时间变化等因素效果不佳，需要更全面的基准测试来指导模型训练。

Method: 提出了MME-VideoOCR基准，包含10类任务、25个具体任务和44种场景，涵盖1,464个视频和2,000个标注QA对，评估了18种MLLMs。

Result: 最佳模型（Gemini-2.5 Pro）准确率仅为73.7%，现有MLLMs在单帧任务中表现良好，但在需要跨帧理解和时空推理的任务中表现有限。

Conclusion: 视频OCR需要高分辨率视觉输入和足够的时间覆盖，现有MLLMs需改进以应对动态视频场景的挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable accuracy
in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from static images. However, their
efficacy in video OCR is significantly diminished due to factors such as motion
blur, temporal variations, and visual effects inherent in video content. To
provide clearer guidance for training practical MLLMs, we introduce the
MME-VideoOCR benchmark, which encompasses a comprehensive range of video OCR
application scenarios. MME-VideoOCR features 10 task categories comprising 25
individual tasks and spans 44 diverse scenarios. These tasks extend beyond text
recognition to incorporate deeper comprehension and reasoning of textual
content within videos. The benchmark consists of 1,464 videos with varying
resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, along with 2,000 meticulously
curated, manually annotated question-answer pairs. We evaluate 18
state-of-the-art MLLMs on MME-VideoOCR, revealing that even the best-performing
model (Gemini-2.5 Pro) achieves an accuracy of only 73.7%. Fine-grained
analysis indicates that while existing MLLMs demonstrate strong performance on
tasks where relevant texts are contained within a single or few frames, they
exhibit limited capability in effectively handling tasks that demand holistic
video comprehension. These limitations are especially evident in scenarios that
require spatio-temporal reasoning, cross-frame information integration, or
resistance to language prior bias. Our findings also highlight the importance
of high-resolution visual input and sufficient temporal coverage for reliable
OCR in dynamic video scenarios.

Conclusion: HoliTom展示了内外结合剪枝策略在视频LLM高效推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Video large language models (video LLMs) excel at video comprehension but
face significant computational inefficiency due to redundant video tokens.
Existing token pruning methods offer solutions. However, approaches operating
within the LLM (inner-LLM pruning), such as FastV, incur intrinsic
computational overhead in shallow layers. In contrast, methods performing token
pruning before the LLM (outer-LLM pruning) primarily address spatial redundancy
within individual frames or limited temporal windows, neglecting the crucial
global temporal dynamics and correlations across longer video sequences. This
leads to sub-optimal spatio-temporal reduction and does not leverage video
compressibility fully. Crucially, the synergistic potential and mutual
influence of combining these strategies remain unexplored. To further reduce
redundancy, we introduce HoliTom, a novel training-free holistic token merging
framework. HoliTom employs outer-LLM pruning through global redundancy-aware
temporal segmentation, followed by spatial-temporal merging to reduce visual
tokens by over 90%, significantly alleviating the LLM's computational burden.
Complementing this, we introduce a robust inner-LLM token similarity-based
merging approach, designed for superior performance and compatibility with
outer-LLM pruning. Evaluations demonstrate our method's promising
efficiency-performance trade-off on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, reducing computational
costs to 6.9% of FLOPs while maintaining 99.1% of the original performance.
Furthermore, we achieve a 2.28x reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and a
1.32x acceleration in decoding throughput, highlighting the practical benefits
of our integrated pruning approach for efficient video LLMs inference.

Result: CNN和ViT在训练中经历三个阶段，且存在错误修正现象，两者表现有明显差异。

Conclusion: DSI为理解深度视觉网络相似性感知提供了系统方法，揭示了CNN和ViT的差异和共性。

Abstract: Similarity manifests in various forms, including semantic similarity that is
particularly important, serving as an approximation of human object
categorization based on e.g. shared functionalities and evolutionary traits. It
also offers practical advantages in computational modeling via lexical
structures such as WordNet with constant and interpretable similarity. As in
the domain of deep vision, there is still not enough focus on the phenomena
regarding the similarity perception emergence. We introduce Deep Similarity
Inspector (DSI) -- a systematic framework to inspect how deep vision networks
develop their similarity perception and its alignment with semantic similarity.
Our experiments show that both Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers' (ViTs) develop a rich similarity perception during training with
3 phases (initial similarity surge, refinement, stabilization), with clear
differences between CNNs and ViTs. Besides the gradual mistakes elimination,
the mistakes refinement phenomenon can be observed.

TLDR: AgriFM是一种专为农业作物制图设计的多源遥感基础模型，通过改进的Video Swin Transformer架构实现多尺度时空特征提取，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感基础模型在作物制图中存在不足，无法同时处理多尺度时空信息。

Method: 采用改进的Video Swin Transformer架构，同步时空下采样，结合多源卫星数据（MODIS、Landsat-8/9、Sentinel-2）进行预训练。

Result: AgriFM在所有下游任务中表现优于传统深度学习和现有遥感基础模型。

Conclusion: AgriFM通过统一处理多尺度时空信息，显著提升了作物制图的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate crop mapping fundamentally relies on modeling multi-scale
spatiotemporal patterns, where spatial scales range from individual field
textures to landscape-level context, and temporal scales capture both
short-term phenological transitions and full growing-season dynamics.
Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising
potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified
spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop
mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the
multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information
by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present
AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed
for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the
necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction,
leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture
where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations.
This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series
satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three
satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is
pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image
samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates
a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned
spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over
conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose
RSFMs across all downstream tasks. Codes will be available at

TLDR: YOLO-SPCI是一种基于YOLOv8的改进检测框架，通过引入轻量级SPCI模块提升多尺度特征表示，在遥感图像检测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像中的目标检测面临尺度变化大、目标分布密集和背景杂乱等挑战，现有检测器缺乏明确的多尺度特征优化机制。

Method: 提出SPCI模块，包含选择性流门（SSG）、视角融合模块（PFM）和类别判别模块（CDM），嵌入YOLOv8的P3和P5阶段。

Result: 在NWPU VHR-10数据集上，YOLO-SPCI性能优于现有先进检测器。

Conclusion: YOLO-SPCI通过SPCI模块有效提升特征表示，适用于高分辨率遥感图像检测。

Abstract: Object detection in remote sensing imagery remains a challenging task due to
extreme scale variation, dense object distributions, and cluttered backgrounds.
While recent detectors such as YOLOv8 have shown promising results, their
backbone architectures lack explicit mechanisms to guide multi-scale feature
refinement, limiting performance on high-resolution aerial data. In this work,
we propose YOLO-SPCI, an attention-enhanced detection framework that introduces
a lightweight Selective-Perspective-Class Integration (SPCI) module to improve
feature representation. The SPCI module integrates three components: a
Selective Stream Gate (SSG) for adaptive regulation of global feature flow, a
Perspective Fusion Module (PFM) for context-aware multi-scale integration, and
a Class Discrimination Module (CDM) to enhance inter-class separability. We
embed two SPCI blocks into the P3 and P5 stages of the YOLOv8 backbone,
enabling effective refinement while preserving compatibility with the original
neck and head. Experiments on the NWPU VHR-10 dataset demonstrate that
YOLO-SPCI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art detectors.

TLDR: 论文提出了Video-Holmes基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂视频推理中的表现，发现现有模型在信息整合方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准主要评估视觉感知和基础能力，无法完全模拟真实世界的复杂推理过程，因此需要更全面的评测工具。

Method: 通过手动标注270部悬疑短片，设计1,837个问题，涵盖7项任务，要求模型主动定位并整合分散的视觉线索。

Result: 最佳模型Gemini-2.5-Pro准确率仅45%，多数模型低于40%，显示模型在信息整合方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: Video-Holmes可作为多模态推理的“Holmes测试”，推动模型更接近人类推理能力，并突显该领域的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in CoT reasoning and RL post-training have been reported to
enhance video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This progress naturally raises a
question: can these models perform complex video reasoning in a manner
comparable to human experts? However, existing video benchmarks primarily
evaluate visual perception and grounding abilities, with questions that can be
answered based on explicit prompts or isolated visual cues. Such benchmarks do
not fully capture the intricacies of real-world reasoning, where humans must
actively search for, integrate, and analyze multiple clues before reaching a
conclusion. To address this issue, we present Video-Holmes, a benchmark
inspired by the reasoning process of Sherlock Holmes, designed to evaluate the
complex video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Video-Holmes consists of 1,837
questions derived from 270 manually annotated suspense short films, which spans
seven carefully designed tasks. Each task is constructed by first identifying
key events and causal relationships within films, and then designing questions
that require models to actively locate and connect multiple relevant visual
clues scattered across different video segments. Our comprehensive evaluation
of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals that, while these models generally excel at
visual perception, they encounter substantial difficulties with integrating
information and often miss critical clues. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves an accuracy of only 45%, with most models
scoring below 40%. We aim that Video-Holmes can serve as a "Holmes-test" for
multimodal reasoning, motivating models to reason more like humans and
emphasizing the ongoing challenges in this field. The benchmark is released in
https://github.com/TencentARC/Video-Holmes.

Motivation: 超高分辨率遥感图像数据稀缺且存在令牌爆炸问题，限制了多模态基础模型的应用。

Method: 提出背景令牌剪枝和锚定令牌选择策略，减少内存占用并保留关键语义。

Result: GeoLLaVA-8K在XLRS-Bench上达到新最优性能。

Conclusion: GeoLLaVA-8K为处理超高分辨率遥感图像提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing (RS) imagery offers valuable data
for Earth observation but pose challenges for existing multimodal foundation
models due to two key bottlenecks: (1) limited availability of UHR training
data, and (2) token explosion caused by the large image size. To address data
scarcity, we introduce SuperRS-VQA (avg. 8,376$\times$8,376) and HighRS-VQA
(avg. 2,000$\times$1,912), the highest-resolution vision-language datasets in
RS to date, covering 22 real-world dialogue tasks. To mitigate token explosion,
our pilot studies reveal significant redundancy in RS images: crucial
information is concentrated in a small subset of object-centric tokens, while
pruning background tokens (e.g., ocean or forest) can even improve performance.
Motivated by these findings, we propose two strategies: Background Token
Pruning and Anchored Token Selection, to reduce the memory footprint while
preserving key semantics.Integrating these techniques, we introduce
GeoLLaVA-8K, the first RS-focused multimodal large language model capable of
handling inputs up to 8K$\times$8K resolution, built on the LLaVA framework.
Trained on SuperRS-VQA and HighRS-VQA, GeoLLaVA-8K sets a new state-of-the-art
on the XLRS-Bench.

Abstract: This work presents a novel text-to-vector graphics generation approach,
Dream3DVG, allowing for arbitrary viewpoint viewing, progressive detail
optimization, and view-dependent occlusion awareness. Our approach is a
dual-branch optimization framework, consisting of an auxiliary 3D Gaussian
Splatting optimization branch and a 3D vector graphics optimization branch. The
introduced 3DGS branch can bridge the domain gaps between text prompts and
vector graphics with more consistent guidance. Moreover, 3DGS allows for
progressive detail control by scheduling classifier-free guidance, facilitating
guiding vector graphics with coarse shapes at the initial stages and finer
details at later stages. We also improve the view-dependent occlusions by
devising a visibility-awareness rendering module. Extensive results on 3D
sketches and 3D iconographies, demonstrate the superiority of the method on
different abstraction levels of details, cross-view consistency, and
occlusion-aware stroke culling.

TLDR: ZigzagPointMamba提出了一种基于zigzag扫描路径和语义孪生掩码策略的方法，解决了PointMamba在点云自监督学习中的空间连续性和局部语义建模问题，显著提升了下游任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PointMamba方法依赖复杂的令牌排序和随机掩码，破坏了空间连续性和局部语义相关性，需要一种更高效的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出ZigzagPointMamba，采用zigzag扫描路径全局排序点云令牌，并引入语义孪生掩码策略（SMS）以增强局部语义建模。

Result: 在多个下游任务中表现优异，如ShapeNetPart分割任务提升1.59% mIoU，ModelNet40分类任务提升0.4%准确率等。

Conclusion: ZigzagPointMamba通过改进空间连续性和语义建模，显著提升了点云自监督学习的性能。

Abstract: State Space models (SSMs) such as PointMamba enable efficient feature
extraction for point cloud self-supervised learning with linear complexity,
outperforming Transformers in computational efficiency. However, existing
PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking,
which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose
ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a
simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing
spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point
tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in
self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese
Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate
reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens.
This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust
global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights
significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on
ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for
classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for
the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of
ScanObjectNN. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现实场景中噪声普遍存在，导致现有多视图聚类方法性能下降，因此需要一种噪声鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出AIRMVC框架，包括基于GMM的噪声识别、混合校正策略和噪声鲁棒的对比机制。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，AIRMVC在噪声场景下优于现有算法。

Conclusion: AIRMVC通过噪声识别和校正，显著提升了多视图聚类的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representation learning capabilities, deep multi-view
clustering methods have demonstrated reliable performance by effectively
integrating multi-source information from diverse views in recent years. Most
existing methods rely on the assumption of clean views. However, noise is
pervasive in real-world scenarios, leading to a significant degradation in
performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel multi-view clustering
framework for the automatic identification and rectification of noisy data,
termed AIRMVC. Specifically, we reformulate noisy identification as an anomaly
identification problem using GMM. We then design a hybrid rectification
strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of noisy data based on the
identification results. Furthermore, we introduce a noise-robust contrastive
mechanism to generate reliable representations. Additionally, we provide a
theoretical proof demonstrating that these representations can discard noisy
information, thereby improving the performance of downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that AIRMVC outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of robustness in noisy scenarios. The code
of AIRMVC are available at https://github.com/xihongyang1999/AIRMVC on Github.

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD和Eyecandies数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Mentor3AD通过多模态导师学习显著提升了3D异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal feature reconstruction is a promising approach for 3D anomaly
detection, leveraging the complementary information from dual modalities. We
further advance this paradigm by utilizing multi-modal mentor learning, which
fuses intermediate features to further distinguish normal from feature
differences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called
Mentor3AD, which utilizes multi-modal mentor learning. By leveraging the shared
features of different modalities, Mentor3AD can extract more effective features
and guide feature reconstruction, ultimately improving detection performance.
Specifically, Mentor3AD includes a Mentor of Fusion Module (MFM) that merges
features extracted from RGB and 3D modalities to create a mentor feature.
Additionally, we have designed a Mentor of Guidance Module (MGM) to facilitate
cross-modal reconstruction, supported by the mentor feature. Lastly, we
introduce a Voting Module (VM) to more accurately generate the final anomaly
score. Extensive comparative and ablation studies on MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies
have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Motivation: 现有唇同步方法依赖参考帧和掩码修复，限制了其对身份一致性、姿态变化、面部遮挡和风格化内容的鲁棒性。音频信号提供的条件较弱，原始视频的唇形泄漏也会影响同步质量。

Method: OmniSync采用基于扩散变换器的无掩码训练范式，提出流匹配渐进噪声初始化，并开发动态时空分类器自由引导机制（DS-CFG）。

Result: 实验表明，OmniSync在视觉质量和唇同步准确性上显著优于现有方法，适用于真实和AI生成视频。

Conclusion: OmniSync通过创新方法解决了唇同步中的关键挑战，为多样化的视觉场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Lip synchronization is the task of aligning a speaker's lip movements in
video with corresponding speech audio, and it is essential for creating
realistic, expressive video content. However, existing methods often rely on
reference frames and masked-frame inpainting, which limit their robustness to
identity consistency, pose variations, facial occlusions, and stylized content.
In addition, since audio signals provide weaker conditioning than visual cues,
lip shape leakage from the original video will affect lip sync quality. In this
paper, we present OmniSync, a universal lip synchronization framework for
diverse visual scenarios. Our approach introduces a mask-free training paradigm
using Diffusion Transformer models for direct frame editing without explicit
masks, enabling unlimited-duration inference while maintaining natural facial
dynamics and preserving character identity. During inference, we propose a
flow-matching-based progressive noise initialization to ensure pose and
identity consistency, while allowing precise mouth-region editing. To address
the weak conditioning signal of audio, we develop a Dynamic Spatiotemporal
Classifier-Free Guidance (DS-CFG) mechanism that adaptively adjusts guidance
strength over time and space. We also establish the AIGC-LipSync Benchmark, the
first evaluation suite for lip synchronization in diverse AI-generated videos.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniSync significantly outperforms prior
methods in both visual quality and lip sync accuracy, achieving superior
results in both real-world and AI-generated videos.

Result: ACTIVE-O3在开放世界任务和特定领域场景中表现优异，并展示了零样本推理能力。

Conclusion: ACTIVE-O3为MLLMs的主动感知研究提供了简单代码库和评估协议。

Abstract: Active vision, also known as active perception, refers to the process of
actively selecting where and how to look in order to gather task-relevant
information. It is a critical component of efficient perception and
decision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and
decision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention.
However, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence,
there is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn
active perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic
definition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the
recently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a
special case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search
efficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose
ACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on
top of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We
further establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across
both general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding,
and domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote
sensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive
segmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot
reasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit
reasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and
evaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in
MLLMs.

Motivation: 当前方法在同时编码高分辨率和缩略图图像时，生成大量图像标记，结合RoPE的长程衰减特性，阻碍了高分辨率标记与缩略图标记以及文本与图像的交互。

Method: 提出ID-Align，通过重新排序位置ID，使高分辨率标记继承对应缩略图标记的ID，并限制位置索引的过度扩展。

Result: 在LLaVA-Next框架下，ID-Align在MMBench关系推理任务上提升了6.09%，并在多个基准测试中表现显著。

Conclusion: ID-Align有效解决了高分辨率与缩略图标记交互问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Currently, a prevalent approach for enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
performance is to encode both the high-resolution version and the thumbnail of
an image simultaneously. While effective, this method generates a large number
of image tokens. When combined with the widely used Rotary Position Embedding
(RoPE), its long-term decay property hinders the interaction between
high-resolution tokens and thumbnail tokens, as well as between text and image.
To address these issues, we propose ID-Align, which alleviates these problems
by reordering position IDs. In this method, high-resolution tokens inherit IDs
from their corresponding thumbnail token while constraining the overexpansion
of positional indices. Our experiments conducted within the LLaVA-Next
framework demonstrate that ID-Align achieves significant improvements,
including a 6.09% enhancement on MMBench's relation reasoning tasks and notable
gains across multiple benchmarks. Our code is available at the following link:

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现优异，但常出现幻觉问题，即在图像中不存在的内容上过度自信。现有方法在开放性和长文本生成场景中难以保持准确性。

Method: CAAC框架通过视觉令牌校准（VTC）平衡视觉令牌的注意力，并通过自适应注意力重缩放（AAR）根据模型置信度强化视觉基础。

Result: 在CHAIR、AMBER和POPE基准测试中，CAAC表现优于基线方法，尤其在长文本生成中显著减少幻觉。

Conclusion: CAAC通过针对空间感知偏差和模态偏差的校准，有效提升了视觉语言模型在生成任务中的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve impressive performance on
multimodal tasks but often suffer from hallucination, and confidently describe
objects or attributes not present in the image. Current inference-time
interventions, while training-free, struggle to maintain accuracy in open-ended
and long-form generation scenarios. We introduce the Confidence-Aware Attention
Calibration (CAAC) framework to address this challenge by targeting two key
biases: spatial perception bias, which distributes attention disproportionately
across image tokens, and modality bias, which shifts focus from visual to
textual inputs over time. CAAC employs a two-step approach: Visual-Token
Calibration (VTC) to balance attention across visual tokens, and Adaptive
Attention Re-Scaling (AAR) to reinforce visual grounding based on the model's
confidence. This confidence-driven adjustment ensures consistent visual
alignment during generation. Experiments on CHAIR, AMBER, and POPE benchmarks
demonstrate that CAAC outperforms baselines, particularly in long-form
generations, effectively reducing hallucination.

coarse-to-fine 1D token sequence aligns well with the autoregressive inference
mechanism, providing a more natural and efficient way for the AR model to
generate complex visual content. Our compact 1D AR model achieves high-quality
image synthesis with significantly fewer tokens than previous approaches, i.e.
VAR/VQGAN. We further propose a parallel inference mechanism with
self-correction that accelerates generation speed by approximately 8x while
reducing accumulation sampling error inherent in teacher-forcing supervision.
On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, our method achieves 2.96 gFID with 128
tokens, outperforming VAR (3.3 FID) and FlexVAR (3.05 FID), which both require
680 tokens in their AR models. Moreover, due to the significantly reduced token
count and parallel inference mechanism, our method runs nearly 2x faster
inference speed compared to VAR and FlexVAR. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate DetailFlow's superior generation quality and efficiency compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 提出的强化学习框架有效解决了多组件流程设计的效率与泛化问题，为自动化文本到图像生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has evolved beyond single monolithic models to
complex multi-component pipelines. These combine fine-tuned generators,
adapters, upscaling blocks and even editing steps, leading to significant
improvements in image quality. However, their effective design requires
substantial expertise. Recent approaches have shown promise in automating this
process through large language models (LLMs), but they suffer from two critical
limitations: extensive computational requirements from generating images with
hundreds of predefined pipelines, and poor generalization beyond memorized
training examples. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based framework
that addresses these inefficiencies. Our approach first trains an ensemble of
reward models capable of predicting image quality scores directly from
prompt-workflow combinations, eliminating the need for costly image generation
during training. We then implement a two-phase training strategy: initial
workflow vocabulary training followed by GRPO-based optimization that guides
the model toward higher-performing regions of the workflow space. Additionally,
we incorporate a classifier-free guidance based enhancement technique that
extrapolates along the path between the initial and GRPO-tuned models, further
improving output quality. We validate our approach through a set of
comparisons, showing that it can successfully create new flows with greater
diversity and lead to superior image quality compared to existing baselines.

Motivation: 现有方法在单图像场景或固有分解技术上表现有限，难以处理多视角一致性、复杂场景和多样光照条件。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的前馈架构，直接建模光照和阴影，避免了基于扩散方法的迭代偏差，并使用Hilbert曲线映射将2D输入与3D高斯场景表示对齐。

Conclusion: MV-CoLight为AR和具身智能应用中的对象合成提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Object compositing offers significant promise for augmented reality (AR) and
embodied intelligence applications. Existing approaches predominantly focus on
single-image scenarios or intrinsic decomposition techniques, facing challenges
with multi-view consistency, complex scenes, and diverse lighting conditions.
Recent inverse rendering advancements, such as 3D Gaussian and diffusion-based
methods, have enhanced consistency but are limited by scalability, heavy data
requirements, or prolonged reconstruction time per scene. To broaden its
applicability, we introduce MV-CoLight, a two-stage framework for
illumination-consistent object compositing in both 2D images and 3D scenes. Our
novel feed-forward architecture models lighting and shadows directly, avoiding
the iterative biases of diffusion-based methods. We employ a Hilbert
curve-based mapping to align 2D image inputs with 3D Gaussian scene
representations seamlessly. To facilitate training and evaluation, we further
introduce a large-scale 3D compositing dataset. Experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art harmonized results across standard benchmarks and our dataset,
as well as casually captured real-world scenes demonstrate the framework's
robustness and wide generalization.

Conclusion: 噪声对齐策略能更好地保留模型先验，同时提升生成效果。

Abstract: Generating multiple distinct subjects remains a challenge for existing
text-to-image diffusion models. Complex prompts often lead to subject leakage,
causing inaccuracies in quantities, attributes, and visual features. Preventing
leakage among subjects necessitates knowledge of each subject's spatial
location. Recent methods provide these spatial locations via an external layout
control. However, enforcing such a prescribed layout often conflicts with the
innate layout dictated by the sampled initial noise, leading to misalignment
with the model's prior. In this work, we introduce a new approach that predicts
a spatial layout aligned with the prompt, derived from the initial noise, and
refines it throughout the denoising process. By relying on this noise-induced
layout, we avoid conflicts with externally imposed layouts and better preserve
the model's prior. Our method employs a small neural network to predict and
refine the evolving noise-induced layout at each denoising step, ensuring clear
boundaries between subjects while maintaining consistency. Experimental results
show that this noise-aligned strategy achieves improved text-image alignment
and more stable multi-subject generation compared to existing layout-guided
techniques, while preserving the rich diversity of the model's original
distribution.

Specifically, starting from image-to-video generation, users can control the

identity references to enter the scene, guided by user-specified motion
trajectory. To support this task, we introduce a new dataset curated
semi-automatically, a comprehensive evaluation protocol targeting this setting,
and an efficient identity-preserving motion-controllable video Diffusion
Transformer architecture. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach

Conclusion: FOA-Attack通过全局和局部特征的最优对齐，显著提升了对抗样本的可转移性，尤其在闭源模型中效果突出。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain vulnerable to transferable
adversarial examples. While existing methods typically achieve targeted attacks
by aligning global features-such as CLIP's [CLS] token-between adversarial and
target samples, they often overlook the rich local information encoded in patch
tokens. This leads to suboptimal alignment and limited transferability,
particularly for closed-source models. To address this limitation, we propose a
targeted transferable adversarial attack method based on feature optimal
alignment, called FOA-Attack, to improve adversarial transfer capability.
Specifically, at the global level, we introduce a global feature loss based on
cosine similarity to align the coarse-grained features of adversarial samples
with those of target samples. At the local level, given the rich local
representations within Transformers, we leverage clustering techniques to
extract compact local patterns to alleviate redundant local features. We then
formulate local feature alignment between adversarial and target samples as an
optimal transport (OT) problem and propose a local clustering optimal transport
loss to refine fine-grained feature alignment. Additionally, we propose a
dynamic ensemble model weighting strategy to adaptively balance the influence
of multiple models during adversarial example generation, thereby further
improving transferability. Extensive experiments across various models
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods, especially in transferring to closed-source MLLMs.

Conclusion: 为下一代全自动海报生成模型指明方向。

Abstract: Academic poster generation is a crucial yet challenging task in scientific
communication, requiring the compression of long-context interleaved documents
into a single, visually coherent page. To address this challenge, we introduce
the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent
conference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on
(i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual
Coherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic
and informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably
(iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by
VLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose
PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser
distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns
text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and
spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by
executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and
ensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o
outputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and
poor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary
aesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual
semantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the
Qwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across
nearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens. It transforms a 22-page paper
into a finalized yet editable .pptx poster - all for just $0.005. These
findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated
poster-generation models. The code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在跨视角空间推理任务中存在局限性，尤其是从非相机视角（如人类视角）进行推理时表现不佳。

Method: 设计了ViewSpatial-Bench基准测试，包含五种任务类型，并开发了自动化3D标注流程生成精确方向标签。通过微调模型在多视角空间数据集上提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，模型在相机视角任务中表现尚可，但在人类视角任务中准确性下降。通过微调，整体性能提升了46.24%。

Conclusion: ViewSpatial-Bench为空间智能提供了关键基准，证明了建模3D空间关系能显著增强视觉语言模型的空间理解能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
understanding and reasoning about visual content, but significant challenges
persist in tasks requiring cross-viewpoint understanding and spatial reasoning.
We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric
spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to
allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of
reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark
designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition
evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D
annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive
evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant
performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on
camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a
human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset,
we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks,
highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial
benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides
empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs'
corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.

Result: PH-Reg有效减少异常令牌，在零样本和线性探测任务中提升了分割和深度预测性能。

Conclusion: PH-Reg是一种高效的方法，无需重新训练即可改进预训练ViT的性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual processing tasks, demonstrating excellent scalability with increased
training data and model size. However, recent work has identified the emergence
of artifact tokens in ViTs that are incongruous with the local semantics. These
anomalous tokens degrade ViT performance in tasks that require fine-grained
localization or structural coherence. An effective mitigation of this issue is
to the addition of register tokens to ViTs, which implicitly "absorb" the
artifact term during training. Given the availability of various large-scale
pre-trained ViTs, in this paper we aim at equipping them with such register
tokens without the need of re-training them from scratch, which is infeasible
considering their size. Specifically, we propose Post Hoc Registers (PH-Reg),
an efficient self-distillation method that integrates registers into an
existing ViT without requiring additional labeled data and full retraining.
PH-Reg initializes both teacher and student networks from the same pre-trained
ViT. The teacher remains frozen and unmodified, while the student is augmented
with randomly initialized register tokens. By applying test-time augmentation
to the teacher's inputs, we generate denoised dense embeddings free of
artifacts, which are then used to optimize only a small subset of unlocked
student weights. We show that our approach can effectively reduce the number of
artifact tokens, improving the segmentation and depth prediction of the student
ViT under zero-shot and linear probing.

Abstract: Large multimodal foundation models, particularly in the domains of language
and vision, have significantly advanced various tasks, including robotics,
autonomous driving, information retrieval, and grounding. However, many of
these models perceive objects as indivisible, overlooking the components that
constitute them. Understanding these components and their associated
affordances provides valuable insights into an object's functionality, which is
fundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a
novel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part
segmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the
performance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks
within everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that
task-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for
state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark,
we introduce a simple baseline that achieves a twofold performance improvement
through fine-tuning with our dataset. With our dataset and benchmark, we aim to
facilitate research on task-oriented part segmentation and enhance the
applicability of VLMs across various domains, including robotics, virtual

Abstract: We propose GRGS, a generalizable and relightable 3D Gaussian framework for
high-fidelity human novel view synthesis under diverse lighting conditions.
Unlike existing methods that rely on per-character optimization or ignore
physical constraints, GRGS adopts a feed-forward, fully supervised strategy
that projects geometry, material, and illumination cues from multi-view 2D
observations into 3D Gaussian representations. Specifically, to reconstruct
lighting-invariant geometry, we introduce a Lighting-aware Geometry Refinement
(LGR) module trained on synthetically relit data to predict accurate depth and
surface normals. Based on the high-quality geometry, a Physically Grounded
Neural Rendering (PGNR) module is further proposed to integrate neural
prediction with physics-based shading, supporting editable relighting with
shadows and indirect illumination. Besides, we design a 2D-to-3D projection
training scheme that leverages differentiable supervision from ambient
occlusion, direct, and indirect lighting maps, which alleviates the
computational cost of explicit ray tracing. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRGS achieves superior visual quality, geometric consistency, and
generalization across characters and lighting conditions.

Conclusion: SWE-rebench为交互式软件工程任务提供了高质量数据和污染无关的评估基准，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: LLM-based agents have shown promising capabilities in a growing range of
software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, advancing this field faces two
critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially
data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with
development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes
of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code
generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive
tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive
SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks
quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these
limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to
continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub
repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset
comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for
reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous
supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a
contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare
results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and
show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to
contamination issues.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了结构推理和语义推理在代码漏洞分析中的重要性，导致对大语言模型的可靠性评估不全面。

Method: 设计了SV-TrustEval-C基准，通过结构推理（代码元素关系）和语义推理（逻辑一致性）两个维度评估模型。

Result: 当前大语言模型在复杂代码关系理解上表现不佳，漏洞分析更多依赖模式匹配而非逻辑推理。

Conclusion: SV-TrustEval-C基准有效，并揭示了大语言模型在推理能力和可信度上需改进的关键领域。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve in understanding and generating code,
accurately evaluating their reliability in analyzing source code
vulnerabilities becomes increasingly vital. While studies have examined LLM
capabilities in tasks like vulnerability detection and repair, they often
overlook the importance of both structure and semantic reasoning crucial for
trustworthy vulnerability analysis. To address this gap, we introduce
SV-TrustEval-C, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' abilities for
vulnerability analysis of code written in the C programming language through
two key dimensions: structure reasoning - assessing how models identify
relationships between code elements under varying data and control flow
complexities; and semantic reasoning - examining their logical consistency in
scenarios where code is structurally and semantically perturbed. Our results
show that current LLMs are far from satisfactory in understanding complex code
relationships and that their vulnerability analyses rely more on pattern
matching than on robust logical reasoning. These findings underscore the
effectiveness of the SV-TrustEval-C benchmark and highlight critical areas for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world
vulnerability analysis tasks. Our initial benchmark dataset is publicly
available.

Conclusion: SWE-Judge是一种可扩展且可靠的替代方案，有望减少对人工评估的依赖。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been
increasingly used to support software developers by generating software
artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately
assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant
challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is
labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, other existing
automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but
they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated
software artifacts.
  In this paper, we present SWE-Judge, the first evaluation metric for
LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the
correctness of generated software artifacts. SWE-Judge first defines five
distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented as an independent judge. A
dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of
judges to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate
SWE-Judge across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks,
including CoNaLa, Card2Code, HumanEval-X, APPS, APR-Assess, and Summary-Assess.
These benchmarks span three SE tasks: code generation, automated program
repair, and code summarization. Experimental results demonstrate that SWE-Judge
consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with
improvements ranging from 5.9% to 183.8% over existing automatic metrics.
Furthermore, SWE-Judge reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are
comparable to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair
tasks. These findings underscore SWE-Judge's potential as a scalable and
reliable alternative to human evaluation.

Abstract: Citations play a fundamental role in the scientific ecosystem, serving as a
foundation for tracking the flow of knowledge, acknowledging prior work, and
assessing scholarly influence. In scientometrics, they are also central to the
construction of quantitative indicators. Not all citations, however, serve the
same function: some provide background, others introduce methods, or compare
results. Therefore, understanding citation intent allows for a more nuanced
interpretation of scientific impact. In this paper, we adopted a GAN-based
method to classify citation intents. Our results revealed that the proposed
method achieves competitive classification performance, closely matching
state-of-the-art results with substantially fewer parameters. This demonstrates
the effectiveness and efficiency of leveraging GAN architectures combined with
contextual embeddings in intent classification task. We also investigated
whether filtering citation intents affects the centrality of papers in citation
networks. Analyzing the network constructed from the unArXiv dataset, we found
that paper rankings can be significantly influenced by citation intent. All
four centrality metrics examined- degree, PageRank, closeness, and betweenness
- were sensitive to the filtering of citation types. The betweenness centrality
displayed the greatest sensitivity, showing substantial changes in ranking when
specific citation intents were removed.

Motivation: 解决颅内场电位记录中任务相关信号稀疏分布且与无关信号纠缠的问题。

Method: 结合空间上下文引导的时空建模识别功能组，并使用解耦产品量化（DPQ）解缠目标功能组内的神经动态。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，BrainStratify显著优于以往解码方法。

Conclusion: BrainStratify为颅内记录的语音解码提供了鲁棒且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Decoding speech directly from neural activity is a central goal in
brain-computer interface (BCI) research. In recent years, exciting advances
have been made through the growing use of intracranial field potential
recordings, such as stereo-ElectroEncephaloGraphy (sEEG) and
ElectroCorticoGraphy (ECoG). These neural signals capture rich population-level
activity but present key challenges: (i) task-relevant neural signals are
sparsely distributed across sEEG electrodes, and (ii) they are often entangled
with task-irrelevant neural signals in both sEEG and ECoG. To address these
challenges, we introduce a unified Coarse-to-Fine neural disentanglement
framework, BrainStratify, which includes (i) identifying functional groups
through spatial-context-guided temporal-spatial modeling, and (ii)
disentangling distinct neural dynamics within the target functional group using
Decoupled Product Quantization (DPQ). We evaluate BrainStratify on two
open-source sEEG datasets and one (epidural) ECoG dataset, spanning tasks like
vocal production and speech perception. Extensive experiments show that
BrainStratify, as a unified framework for decoding speech from intracranial
neural signals, significantly outperforms previous decoding methods. Overall,
by combining data-driven stratification with neuroscience-inspired modularity,
BrainStratify offers a robust and interpretable solution for speech decoding
from intracranial recordings.

Motivation: 解决无配对数据集中风格迁移时内容保真度不足的问题，特别是在生物医学领域需要高精度结构保留的任务中。

Method: 采用U-Net生成器、近似双向谱归一化和注意力机制，结合图像尺度增强训练。

Result: 在生物医学任务中成功实现内容保真，首次用无配对数据分离免疫荧光图像中的叠加信号。

Conclusion: Ui2i在需要高内容保真度的任务中表现优异，为无配对图像翻译提供了新方法。

Abstract: This work introduces Ui2i, a novel model for unpaired image-to-image
translation, trained on content-wise unpaired datasets to enable style transfer
across domains while preserving content. Building on CycleGAN, Ui2i
incorporates key modifications to better disentangle content and style
features, and preserve content integrity. Specifically, Ui2i employs
U-Net-based generators with skip connections to propagate localized shallow
features deep into the generator. Ui2i removes feature-based normalization
layers from all modules and replaces them with approximate bidirectional
spectral normalization -- a parameter-based alternative that enhances training
stability. To further support content preservation, channel and spatial
attention mechanisms are integrated into the generators. Training is
facilitated through image scale augmentation. Evaluation on two biomedical
tasks -- domain adaptation for nuclear segmentation in immunohistochemistry
(IHC) images and unmixing of biological structures superimposed in
single-channel immunofluorescence (IF) images -- demonstrates Ui2i's ability to
preserve content fidelity in settings that demand more accurate structural
preservation than typical translation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Ui2i
is the first approach capable of separating superimposed signals in IF images
using real, unpaired training data.

Conclusion: 提出多中心标准化协议和临床整合路线图，以推动视网膜筛查在精准预防和早期干预中的应用。

Abstract: Retinal imaging has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive modality for
detecting and quantifying biomarkers of systemic diseases-ranging from diabetes
and hypertension to Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disorders but
current insights remain dispersed across platforms and specialties. Recent
technological advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT/OCTA) and adaptive
optics (AO) now deliver ultra-high-resolution scans (down to 5 {\mu}m ) with
superior contrast and spatial integration, allowing early identification of
microvascular abnormalities and neurodegenerative changes. At the same time,
AI-driven and machine learning (ML) algorithms have revolutionized the analysis
of large-scale retinal datasets, increasing sensitivity and specificity; for
example, deep learning models achieve > 90 \% sensitivity for diabetic
retinopathy and AUC = 0.89 for the prediction of cardiovascular risk from
fundus photographs. The proliferation of mobile health technologies and
telemedicine platforms further extends access, reduces costs, and facilitates
community-based screening and longitudinal monitoring. Despite these
breakthroughs, translation into routine practice is hindered by heterogeneous
imaging protocols, limited external validation of AI models, and integration
challenges within clinical workflows. In this review, we systematically
synthesize the latest OCT/OCT and AO developments, AI/ML approaches, and
mHealth/Tele-ophthalmology initiatives and quantify their diagnostic
performance across disease domains. Finally, we propose a roadmap for
multicenter protocol standardization, prospective validation trials, and
seamless incorporation of retinal screening into primary and specialty care
pathways-paving the way for precision prevention, early intervention, and
ongoing treatment of life-threatening systemic diseases.

Conclusion: MiLD成功解决了多时相高光谱解混问题，并提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing can capture dynamical evolution of
materials. Despite its capability, current methods emphasize variability of
endmembers while neglecting dynamics of abundances, which motivates our
adoption of neural ordinary differential equations to model abundances
temporally. However, this motivation is hindered by two challenges: the
inherent complexity in defining, modeling and solving problem, and the absence
of theoretical support. To address above challenges, in this paper, we propose
a multitemporal latent dynamical (MiLD) unmixing framework by capturing
dynamical evolution of materials with theoretical validation. For addressing
multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing, MiLD consists of problem definition,
mathematical modeling, solution algorithm and theoretical support. We formulate
multitemporal unmixing problem definition by conducting ordinary differential
equations and developing latent variables. We transfer multitemporal unmixing
to mathematical model by dynamical discretization approaches, which describe
the discreteness of observed sequence images with mathematical expansions. We
propose algorithm to solve problem and capture dynamics of materials, which
approximates abundance evolution by neural networks. Furthermore, we provide
theoretical support by validating the crucial properties, which verifies
consistency, convergence and stability theorems. The major contributions of
MiLD include defining problem by ordinary differential equations, modeling
problem by dynamical discretization approach, solving problem by multitemporal
unmixing algorithm, and presenting theoretical support. Our experiments on both
synthetic and real datasets have validated the utility of our work

Motivation: 生成式图像压缩（GIC）通过结合生成模型提升重建图像的逼真度，但现有方法未能直接利用扩散模型。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将压缩过程重新定义为由随机微分方程（SDEs）控制的前向扩散路径，并训练反向神经网络直接重建图像，无需高斯噪声初始化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在感知失真、统计保真度和无参考质量评估等多项指标上优于现有生成式图像压缩方法。

Conclusion: 提出的扩散模型框架为生成式图像压缩提供了高效且高质量的新方法。

Abstract: While learned image compression (LIC) focuses on efficient data transmission,
generative image compression (GIC) extends this framework by integrating
generative modeling to produce photo-realistic reconstructed images. In this
paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based generative modeling framework
tailored for generative image compression. Unlike prior diffusion-based
approaches that indirectly exploit diffusion modeling, we reinterpret the
compression process itself as a forward diffusion path governed by stochastic
differential equations (SDEs). A reverse neural network is trained to
reconstruct images by reversing the compression process directly, without
requiring Gaussian noise initialization. This approach achieves smooth rate
adjustment and photo-realistic reconstructions with only a minimal number of
sampling steps. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing generative image compression approaches across
a range of metrics, including perceptual distortion, statistical fidelity, and
no-reference quality assessments.

Method: 使用自监督卷积自编码器提取微超声图像特征，随机森林分类器预测癌症，并与基于PSA、DRE等的临床模型对比。

Result: AI模型的AUROC为0.871，敏感性92.5%，特异性68.1%；临床模型AUROC为0.753，敏感性96.2%，特异性27.3%。

Conclusion: AI解读微超声提高了特异性，可能减少不必要的活检，成为低成本筛查替代方案。

Abstract: Background and objective: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a novel imaging
modality with diagnostic accuracy comparable to MRI for detecting clinically
significant prostate cancer (csPCa). We investigated whether artificial
intelligence (AI) interpretation of micro-US can outperform clinical screening
methods using PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE). Methods: We
retrospectively studied 145 men who underwent micro-US guided biopsy (79 with
csPCa, 66 without). A self-supervised convolutional autoencoder was used to
extract deep image features from 2D micro-US slices. Random forest classifiers
were trained using five-fold cross-validation to predict csPCa at the slice
level. Patients were classified as csPCa-positive if 88 or more consecutive
slices were predicted positive. Model performance was compared with a
classifier using PSA, DRE, prostate volume, and age. Key findings and
limitations: The AI-based micro-US model and clinical screening model achieved
AUROCs of 0.871 and 0.753, respectively. At a fixed threshold, the micro-US
model achieved 92.5% sensitivity and 68.1% specificity, while the clinical
model showed 96.2% sensitivity but only 27.3% specificity. Limitations include
a retrospective single-center design and lack of external validation.
Conclusions and clinical implications: AI-interpreted micro-US improves
specificity while maintaining high sensitivity for csPCa detection. This method
may reduce unnecessary biopsies and serve as a low-cost alternative to
PSA-based screening. Patient summary: We developed an AI system to analyze
prostate micro-ultrasound images. It outperformed PSA and DRE in detecting
aggressive cancer and may help avoid unnecessary biopsies.

TLDR: FastCache通过隐藏状态缓存和压缩框架加速DiT推理，减少计算冗余，保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT模型计算密集，FastCache旨在通过利用内部表示冗余提高效率。

Method: 引入空间感知令牌选择机制和变换器级缓存，减少冗余计算。

Result: 显著降低延迟和内存使用，生成质量优于其他缓存方法。

Conclusion: FastCache高效且保持生成质量，理论分析和实验验证其有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are powerful generative models but remain
computationally intensive due to their iterative structure and deep transformer
stacks. To alleviate this inefficiency, we propose FastCache, a
hidden-state-level caching and compression framework that accelerates DiT
inference by exploiting redundancy within the model's internal representations.
FastCache introduces a dual strategy: (1) a spatial-aware token selection
mechanism that adaptively filters redundant tokens based on hidden state
saliency, and (2) a transformer-level cache that reuses latent activations
across timesteps when changes are statistically insignificant. These modules
work jointly to reduce unnecessary computation while preserving generation
fidelity through learnable linear approximation. Theoretical analysis shows
that FastCache maintains bounded approximation error under a
hypothesis-testing-based decision rule. Empirical evaluations across multiple
DiT variants demonstrate substantial reductions in latency and memory usage,
with best generation output quality compared to other cache methods, as
measured by FID and t-FID. Code implementation of FastCache is available on
GitHub at https://github.com/NoakLiu/FastCache-xDiT.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在长上下文场景（如长视频）中性能下降，且现有的RoPE扩展方法缺乏理论分析，无法可靠捕捉语义相似性。

Method: 提出HoPE，结合混合频率分配策略和动态时间缩放机制，以提升长上下文中的语义建模能力。

Result: 在四个长视频理解和检索基准测试中，HoPE表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HoPE有效提升了视觉语言模型在长上下文场景中的性能，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal
tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates in long-context scenarios,
particularly long videos. While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has been
widely adopted for length generalization in Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending vanilla RoPE to capture the intricate spatial-temporal dependencies
in videos remains an unsolved challenge. Existing methods typically allocate
different frequencies within RoPE to encode 3D positional information. However,
these allocation strategies mainly rely on heuristics, lacking in-depth
theoretical analysis. In this paper, we first study how different allocation
strategies impact the long-context capabilities of VLMs. Our analysis reveals
that current multimodal RoPEs fail to reliably capture semantic similarities
over extended contexts. To address this issue, we propose HoPE, a Hybrid of
Position Embedding designed to improve the long-context capabilities of VLMs.
HoPE introduces a hybrid frequency allocation strategy for reliable semantic
modeling over arbitrarily long context, and a dynamic temporal scaling
mechanism to facilitate robust learning and flexible inference across diverse
context lengths. Extensive experiments across four video benchmarks on long
video understanding and retrieval tasks demonstrate that HoPE consistently
outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness. Code is available

Motivation: 数据异构性对联邦学习的挑战，现有方法缺乏对全局决策边界影响的深入理解。

Method: 提出FedProj框架，设计服务器端知识转移损失和利用公共数据集记忆机制调节梯度更新。

Result: FedProj在实验中大幅优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedProj有效解决了全局决策边界遗忘问题，提升了联邦学习性能。

Abstract: The inevitable presence of data heterogeneity has made federated learning
very challenging. There are numerous methods to deal with this issue, such as
local regularization, better model fusion techniques, and data sharing. Though
effective, they lack a deep understanding of how data heterogeneity can affect
the global decision boundary. In this paper, we bridge this gap by performing
an experimental analysis of the learned decision boundary using a toy example.
Our observations are surprising: (1) we find that the existing methods suffer
from forgetting and clients forget the global decision boundary and only learn
the perfect local one, and (2) this happens regardless of the initial weights,
and clients forget the global decision boundary even starting from pre-trained
optimal weights. In this paper, we present FedProj, a federated learning
framework that robustly learns the global decision boundary and avoids its
forgetting during local training. To achieve better ensemble knowledge fusion,
we design a novel server-side ensemble knowledge transfer loss to further
calibrate the learned global decision boundary. To alleviate the issue of
learned global decision boundary forgetting, we further propose leveraging an
episodic memory of average ensemble logits on a public unlabeled dataset to
regulate the gradient updates at each step of local training. Experimental
results demonstrate that FedProj outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a
large margin.

Motivation: 传统马尔可夫强化学习无法明确激励反思性探索，限制了模型在测试时的表现。

Method: 通过贝叶斯自适应强化学习框架，优化马尔可夫决策过程的后验分布，结合奖励最大化和信息收集探索。

Result: BARL在合成和数学推理任务中优于传统方法，提升了探索效率和令牌利用率。

Conclusion: BARL为反思性探索提供了理论指导，并在实践中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) have
exhibited strong reasoning capabilities and emergent reflective behaviors, such
as backtracking and error correction. However, conventional Markovian RL
confines exploration to the training phase to learn an optimal deterministic
policy and depends on the history contexts only through the current state.
Therefore, it remains unclear whether reflective reasoning will emerge during
Markovian RL training, or why they are beneficial at test time. To remedy this,
we recast reflective exploration within the Bayes-Adaptive RL framework, which
explicitly optimizes the expected return under a posterior distribution over
Markov decision processes. This Bayesian formulation inherently incentivizes
both reward-maximizing exploitation and information-gathering exploration via
belief updates. Our resulting algorithm, BARL, instructs the LLM to stitch and
switch strategies based on the observed outcomes, offering principled guidance
on when and how the model should reflectively explore. Empirical results on
both synthetic and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that BARL
outperforms standard Markovian RL approaches at test time, achieving superior
token efficiency with improved exploration effectiveness. Our code is available
at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/BARL.

Motivation: 现有无监督特征选择方法通常从单一视角建模，难以同时评估特征重要性和保留数据结构，限制了性能。

Method: BLUFS方法包括聚类层次（谱聚类生成伪标签和线性回归学习投影矩阵）和特征层次（ℓ2,0-范数约束投影矩阵），并设计了高效的PAM算法求解。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，BLUFS在聚类和分类任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: BLUFS是首个结合双层次框架和ℓ2,0-范数的工作，通过高效算法实现，显著提升了无监督特征选择的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (UFS) is an important task in data
engineering. However, most UFS methods construct models from a single
perspective and often fail to simultaneously evaluate feature importance and
preserve their inherent data structure, thus limiting their performance. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel bi-level unsupervised feature
selection (BLUFS) method, including a clustering level and a feature level.
Specifically, at the clustering level, spectral clustering is used to generate
pseudo-labels for representing the data structure, while a continuous linear
regression model is developed to learn the projection matrix. At the feature
level, the $\ell_{2,0}$-norm constraint is imposed on the projection matrix for
more effectively selecting features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to combine a bi-level framework with the $\ell_{2,0}$-norm. To solve
the proposed bi-level model, we design an efficient proximal alternating
minimization (PAM) algorithm, whose subproblems either have explicit solutions
or can be computed by fast solvers. Furthermore, we establish the convergence
result and computational complexity. Finally, extensive experiments on two
synthetic datasets and eight real datasets demonstrate the superiority of BLUFS
in clustering and classification tasks.

Result: 在WEAR数据集上，改进模型对惯性数据的平均mAP提升了16.01%。

Conclusion: 改进的ActionFormer有效提升了传感器信号处理的性能，尤其在时间动态性和特征依赖性方面表现更优。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has recently witnessed advancements with
Transformer-based models. Especially, ActionFormer shows us a new perspectives
for HAR in the sense that this approach gives us additional outputs which
detect the border of the activities as well as the activity labels.
ActionFormer was originally proposed with its input as image/video. However,
this was converted to with its input as sensor signals as well. We analyze this
extensively in terms of deep learning architectures. Based on the report of
high temporal dynamics which limits the model's ability to capture subtle
changes effectively and of the interdependencies between the spatial and
temporal features. We propose the modified ActionFormer which will decrease
these defects for sensor signals. The key to our approach lies in accordance
with the Sequence-and-Excitation strategy to minimize the increase in
additional parameters and opt for the swish activation function to retain the
information about direction in the negative range. Experiments on the WEAR
dataset show that our method achieves substantial improvement of a 16.01\% in
terms of average mAP for inertial data.

Motivation: 通过扩散扩展理论解决现有一步扩散蒸馏方法的分散性问题，提出统一的理论框架Uni-Instruct。

Method: 提出扩散扩展理论，克服原始扩展f-散度的不可处理性，设计等效且可处理的损失函数。

Result: 在CIFAR10和ImageNet-64×64基准测试中取得最优FID值，并在文本到3D生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Uni-Instruct的理论和实证贡献为一步扩散蒸馏和扩散模型知识迁移的未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation
approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, $f$-distill, etc, inside a
theory-driven framework which we name the \textbf{\emph{Uni-Instruct}}.
Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the
$f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the
intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an
equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models
by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification
introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that
help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also
leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the
CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet
Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional
generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the
ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA
one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step
teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35).
We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For
text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly
outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation
quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions
of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion
distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.

Abstract: Transformers have reshaped machine learning by utilizing attention mechanisms
to capture complex patterns in large datasets, leading to significant
improvements in performance. This success has contributed to the belief that
"bigger means better", leading to ever-increasing model sizes. This paper
challenge this ideology by showing that many existing transformers might be
unnecessarily oversized. We discover a theoretical principle that redefines the
role of multi-head attention. An important benefit of the multiple heads is in
improving the conditioning of the attention block. We exploit this theoretical
insight and redesign popular architectures with an increased number of heads.
The improvement in the conditioning proves so significant in practice that
model depth can be decreased, reducing the parameter count by up to 30-50%
while maintaining accuracy. We obtain consistent benefits across a variety of

*Yiwei Wu,Atticus Geiger,Raphaël Millière*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文研究了Transformer模型如何在没有内置绑定操作的情况下学习变量绑定的能力，揭示了训练过程中的三个阶段，并发现模型利用残差流作为可寻址内存空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索现代神经网络如何在没有内置绑定操作的情况下实现变量绑定，以弥合连接主义和符号主义方法之间的差距。

Method: 通过训练Transformer模型在符号程序中解引用查询变量，分析其训练过程中的三个阶段，并使用因果干预揭示模型机制。

Result: 模型在训练中经历了三个阶段，最终学会了利用残差流作为可寻址内存空间，并通过专门的注意力头动态跟踪变量绑定。

Conclusion: Transformer模型可以在没有显式架构支持的情况下学习实现系统的变量绑定，为连接主义和符号主义方法的结合提供了新视角。

Abstract: Variable binding -- the ability to associate variables with values -- is
fundamental to symbolic computation and cognition. Although classical
architectures typically implement variable binding via addressable memory, it
is not well understood how modern neural networks lacking built-in binding
operations may acquire this capacity. We investigate this by training a
Transformer to dereference queried variables in symbolic programs where
variables are assigned either numerical constants or other variables. Each
program requires following chains of variable assignments up to four steps deep
to find the queried value, and also contains irrelevant chains of assignments
acting as distractors. Our analysis reveals a developmental trajectory with
three distinct phases during training: (1) random prediction of numerical
constants, (2) a shallow heuristic prioritizing early variable assignments, and
(3) the emergence of a systematic mechanism for dereferencing assignment
chains. Using causal interventions, we find that the model learns to exploit
the residual stream as an addressable memory space, with specialized attention
heads routing information across token positions. This mechanism allows the
model to dynamically track variable bindings across layers, resulting in
accurate dereferencing. Our results show how Transformer models can learn to
implement systematic variable binding without explicit architectural support,
bridging connectionist and symbolic approaches.

*Charles London,Varun Kanade*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 暂停符号（如“...”）能提升Transformer在语言和数学任务中的表现，但其理论作用尚不明确。本文首次证明，暂停符号能严格增加Transformer的计算表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释暂停符号如何提升Transformer的计算能力，填补理论空白。

Method: 通过形式化分离结果，分析暂停符号对Transformer宽度、深度和数值精度的影响。

Result: 暂停符号使Transformer能表达更复杂的函数类（如$\mathsf{AC}^0$和$\mathsf{TC}^0$），并在实验中验证其学习能力。

Conclusion: 暂停符号是增强Transformer推理能力的独特机制，与链式思维提示互补。

Abstract: Pause tokens, simple filler symbols such as "...", consistently improve
Transformer performance on both language and mathematical tasks, yet their
theoretical effect remains unexplained. We provide the first formal separation
result, proving that adding pause tokens to constant-depth, logarithmic-width
Transformers strictly increases their computational expressivity. With
bounded-precision activations, Transformers without pause tokens compute only a
strict subset of $\mathsf{AC}^0$ functions, while adding a polynomial number of
pause tokens allows them to express the entire class. For logarithmic-precision
Transformers, we show that adding pause tokens achieves expressivity equivalent
to $\mathsf{TC}^0$, matching known upper bounds. Empirically, we demonstrate
that two-layer causally masked Transformers can learn parity when supplied with
pause tokens, a function that they appear unable to learn without them. Our
results provide a rigorous theoretical explanation for prior empirical
findings, clarify how pause tokens interact with width, depth, and numeric
precision, and position them as a distinct mechanism, complementary to
chain-of-thought prompting, for enhancing Transformer reasoning.

*Yichuan Cao,Yibo Miao,Xiao-Shan Gao,Yinpeng Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出了一种基于规则偏好建模的红队测试方法（RPG-RT），通过迭代修改提示词并利用反馈动态适应未知防御机制，解决了现有方法在封闭模型和多样化防御机制下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像（T2I）模型可能生成不当或有害内容，现有红队测试方法在封闭模型和未知防御机制下效果有限。

Method: 提出RPG-RT方法，利用LLM迭代修改提示词，结合反馈和规则偏好建模动态适应防御机制。

Result: 在19个T2I系统、3个商业API和T2V模型上的实验验证了方法的优越性和实用性。

Conclusion: RPG-RT有效解决了未知防御机制的挑战，为T2I模型的安全性评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models raise ethical and safety concerns due to their
potential to generate inappropriate or harmful images. Evaluating these models'
security through red-teaming is vital, yet white-box approaches are limited by
their need for internal access, complicating their use with closed-source
models. Moreover, existing black-box methods often assume knowledge about the
model's specific defense mechanisms, limiting their utility in real-world
commercial API scenarios. A significant challenge is how to evade unknown and
diverse defense mechanisms. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel
Rule-based Preference modeling Guided Red-Teaming (RPG-RT), which iteratively
employs LLM to modify prompts to query and leverages feedback from T2I systems
for fine-tuning the LLM. RPG-RT treats the feedback from each iteration as a
prior, enabling the LLM to dynamically adapt to unknown defense mechanisms.
Given that the feedback is often labeled and coarse-grained, making it
difficult to utilize directly, we further propose rule-based preference
modeling, which employs a set of rules to evaluate desired or undesired
feedback, facilitating finer-grained control over the LLM's dynamic adaptation
process. Extensive experiments on nineteen T2I systems with varied safety
mechanisms, three online commercial API services, and T2V models verify the
superiority and practicality of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型（DMs）的信号恢复方法，专注于半参数单指标模型，能够处理非线性测量模型中的不连续或未知链接函数，且仅需一轮无条件采样和部分反转DMs即可实现高效重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在信号恢复中要么局限于特定重建问题，要么无法处理非线性测量模型中的不连续或未知链接函数，因此需要一种更通用的方法。

Method: 提出了一种高效的信号恢复方法，仅需一轮无条件采样和部分反转扩散模型，适用于半参数单指标模型。

Result: 数值实验表明，相比其他方法，该方法能以更少的神经网络评估实现更准确的信号重建。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实验上均表现出色，为非线性测量模型中的信号恢复提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated remarkable ability to generate
diverse and high-quality images by efficiently modeling complex data
distributions. They have also been explored as powerful generative priors for
signal recovery, resulting in a substantial improvement in the quality of
reconstructed signals. However, existing research on signal recovery with
diffusion models either focuses on specific reconstruction problems or is
unable to handle nonlinear measurement models with discontinuous or unknown
link functions. In this work, we focus on using DMs to achieve accurate
recovery from semi-parametric single index models, which encompass a variety of
popular nonlinear models that may have {\em discontinuous} and {\em unknown}
link functions. We propose an efficient reconstruction method that only
requires one round of unconditional sampling and (partial) inversion of DMs.
Theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed methods has been
established under appropriate conditions. We perform numerical experiments on
image datasets for different nonlinear measurement models. We observe that
compared to competing methods, our approach can yield more accurate
reconstructions while utilizing significantly fewer neural function
evaluations.

Method: PoisonSwarm框架通过生成良性数据作为基础模板，分解为语义单元后逐单元毒化，并通过动态模型切换确保合成成功。

Result: 实验表明，PoisonSwarm在有害数据合成中表现出色，具有高扩展性和多样性。

Conclusion: PoisonSwarm为有害信息合成提供了高效可靠的解决方案，推动了AI安全领域的发展。

Abstract: To construct responsible and secure AI applications, harmful information data
is widely utilized for adversarial testing and the development of safeguards.
Existing studies mainly leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize
data to obtain high-quality task datasets at scale, thereby avoiding costly
human annotation. However, limited by the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs,
the synthesis of harmful data still faces challenges in generation reliability
and content diversity. In this study, we propose a novel harmful information
synthesis framework, PoisonSwarm, which applies the model crowdsourcing
strategy to generate diverse harmful data while maintaining a high success
rate. Specifically, we generate abundant benign data as the based templates in
a counterfactual manner. Subsequently, we decompose each based template into
multiple semantic units and perform unit-by-unit toxification and final
refinement through dynamic model switching, thus ensuring the success of
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that PoisonSwarm achieves
state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing different categories of harmful
data with high scalability and diversity.

TLDR: SageAttention2++通过量化加速注意力机制中的矩阵乘法，利用FP8指令进一步提速，比FlashAttention快3.9倍且保持相同精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力机制的时间复杂度随序列长度呈二次增长，效率至关重要。

Method: 采用量化加速矩阵乘法，并利用FP8指令（比原FP8快2倍）进一步优化。

Result: SageAttention2++比FlashAttention快3.9倍，且精度与SageAttention2相同。

Conclusion: SageAttention2++能高效加速多种模型（如语言、图像、视频生成），且端到端指标损失可忽略。

Abstract: The efficiency of attention is critical because its time complexity grows
quadratically with sequence length. SageAttention2 addresses this by utilizing
quantization to accelerate matrix multiplications (Matmul) in attention. To
further accelerate SageAttention2, we propose to utilize the faster instruction
of FP8 Matmul accumulated in FP16. The instruction is 2x faster than the FP8
Matmul used in SageAttention2. Our experiments show that SageAttention2++
achieves a 3.9x speedup over FlashAttention while maintaining the same
attention accuracy as SageAttention2. This means SageAttention2++ effectively
accelerates various models, including those for language, image, and video
generation, with negligible end-to-end metrics loss. The code will be available

### [305] [Hardware-Efficient Attention for Fast Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21487)
*Ted Zadouri,Hubert Strauss,Tri Dao*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出两种注意力机制改进方法（GTA和GLA），通过减少KV缓存加载和优化并行性，显著提升LLM解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM解码在长上下文和大批次时受限于KV缓存加载和并行性不足，硬件利用率低。

Method: 提出Grouped-Tied Attention (GTA)减少内存传输，Grouped Latent Attention (GLA)优化并行解码。

Result: GTA节省一半KV缓存，GLA比FlashMLA快2倍，在线服务延迟降低2倍。

Conclusion: GTA和GLA有效提升解码效率，硬件利用率高，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: LLM decoding is bottlenecked for large batches and long contexts by loading
the key-value (KV) cache from high-bandwidth memory, which inflates per-token
latency, while the sequential nature of decoding limits parallelism. We analyze
the interplay among arithmetic intensity, parallelization, and model quality
and question whether current architectures fully exploit modern hardware. This
work redesigns attention to perform more computation per byte loaded from
memory to maximize hardware efficiency without trading off parallel
scalability. We first propose Grouped-Tied Attention (GTA), a simple variant
that combines and reuses key and value states, reducing memory transfers
without compromising model quality. We then introduce Grouped Latent Attention
(GLA), a parallel-friendly latent attention paired with low-level optimizations
for fast decoding while maintaining high model quality. Experiments show that
GTA matches Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) quality while using roughly half the
KV cache and that GLA matches Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and is easier
to shard. Our optimized GLA kernel is up to 2$\times$ faster than FlashMLA, for
example, in a speculative decoding setting when the query length exceeds one.
Furthermore, by fetching a smaller KV cache per device, GLA reduces end-to-end
latency and increases throughput in online serving benchmarks by up to
2$\times$.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种无需验证器的VeriFree方法，通过直接最大化生成参考答案的概率，解决了传统基于验证器的RL方法在通用推理领域的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于验证器的RL方法仅适用于可验证答案的任务，无法扩展到现实领域（如化学、医疗等），且存在依赖强验证器、易受奖励攻击等问题。

Method: 提出VeriFree方法，绕过答案验证，直接使用RL最大化生成参考答案的概率。

Result: VeriFree在多个基准测试（MMLU-Pro、GPQA等）上表现优于或匹配基于验证器的方法，且计算需求更低。

Conclusion: VeriFree不仅具有实际优势，还为统一训练策略和变分优化提供了新视角。

Abstract: The recent paradigm shift towards training large language models (LLMs) using
DeepSeek-R1-Zero-style reinforcement learning (RL) on verifiable rewards has
led to impressive advancements in code and mathematical reasoning. However,
this methodology is limited to tasks where rule-based answer verification is
possible and does not naturally extend to real-world domains such as chemistry,
healthcare, engineering, law, biology, business, and economics. Current
practical workarounds use an additional LLM as a model-based verifier; however,
this introduces issues such as reliance on a strong verifier LLM,
susceptibility to reward hacking, and the practical burden of maintaining the
verifier model in memory during training. To address this and extend
DeepSeek-R1-Zero-style training to general reasoning domains, we propose a
verifier-free method (VeriFree) that bypasses answer verification and instead
uses RL to directly maximize the probability of generating the reference
answer. We compare VeriFree with verifier-based methods and demonstrate that,
in addition to its significant practical benefits and reduced compute
requirements, VeriFree matches and even surpasses verifier-based methods on
extensive evaluations across MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, and math-related
benchmarks. Moreover, we provide insights into this method from multiple
perspectives: as an elegant integration of training both the policy and
implicit verifier in a unified model, and as a variational optimization
approach. Code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/VeriFree.

TLDR: 提出了一种评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）中文化偏见的新框架，通过三个检索任务揭示了模型在种族、性别和身体特征上的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs在多元文化背景中应用广泛，但其内部偏见尚未被充分理解，因此需要系统评估。

Method: 设计了三个检索任务：种族与国家关联、个人特质与国家关联、身体特征与国家关联。

Result: 研究发现VLMs存在持续的偏见，可能无意中强化社会刻板印象。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs中的文化偏见，强调了模型在多元文化应用中的潜在风险。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse cultural
contexts, yet their internal biases remain poorly understood. In this work, we
propose a novel framework to systematically evaluate how VLMs encode cultural
differences and biases related to race, gender, and physical traits across
countries. We introduce three retrieval-based tasks: (1) Race to Country
retrieval, which examines the association between individuals from specific
racial groups (East Asian, White, Middle Eastern, Latino, South Asian, and
Black) and different countries; (2) Personal Traits to Country retrieval, where
images are paired with trait-based prompts (e.g., Smart, Honest, Criminal,
Violent) to investigate potential stereotypical associations; and (3) Physical
Characteristics to Country retrieval, focusing on visual attributes like
skinny, young, obese, and old to explore how physical appearances are
culturally linked to nations. Our findings reveal persistent biases in VLMs,
highlighting how visual representations may inadvertently reinforce societal
stereotypes.

TLDR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）中系统提示对模型行为的影响，揭示了因信息位置不同导致的偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统提示在LLMs中优先级高于用户输入，但其分层实现缺乏透明度，可能引发未被察觉的副作用和偏见。

Method: 比较六种商业LLMs中系统提示与用户提示对50个人口统计群体信息的处理差异。

Result: 发现显著的偏见，表现为用户表征和决策场景的差异，这些偏见源于不透明的系统配置。

Conclusion: 呼吁将系统提示分析纳入AI审计流程，以避免潜在危害。

Abstract: System prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs) are predefined directives that
guide model behaviour, taking precedence over user inputs in text processing
and generation. LLM deployers increasingly use them to ensure consistent
responses across contexts. While model providers set a foundation of system
prompts, deployers and third-party developers can append additional prompts
without visibility into others' additions, while this layered implementation
remains entirely hidden from end-users. As system prompts become more complex,
they can directly or indirectly introduce unaccounted for side effects. This
lack of transparency raises fundamental questions about how the position of
information in different directives shapes model outputs. As such, this work
examines how the placement of information affects model behaviour. To this end,
we compare how models process demographic information in system versus user
prompts across six commercially available LLMs and 50 demographic groups. Our
analysis reveals significant biases, manifesting in differences in user
representation and decision-making scenarios. Since these variations stem from
inaccessible and opaque system-level configurations, they risk
representational, allocative and potential other biases and downstream harms
beyond the user's ability to detect or correct. Our findings draw attention to
these critical issues, which have the potential to perpetuate harms if left
unexamined. Further, we argue that system prompt analysis must be incorporated
into AI auditing processes, particularly as customisable system prompts become
increasingly prevalent in commercial AI deployments.

Abstract: Landing safely in crowded urban environments remains an essential yet
challenging endeavor for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), especially in
emergency situations. In this work, we propose a risk-aware approach that
harnesses semantic segmentation to continuously evaluate potential hazards in
the drone's field of view. By using a specialized deep neural network to assign
pixel-level risk values and applying an algorithm based on risk maps, our
method adaptively identifies a stable Safe Landing Zone (SLZ) despite moving
critical obstacles such as vehicles, people, etc., and other visual challenges
like shifting illumination. A control system then guides the UAV toward this
low-risk region, employing altitude-dependent safety thresholds and temporal
landing point stabilization to ensure robust descent trajectories. Experimental
validation in diverse urban environments demonstrates the effectiveness of our
approach, achieving over 90% landing success rates in very challenging real
scenarios, showing significant improvements in various risk metrics. Our
findings suggest that risk-oriented vision methods can effectively help reduce
the risk of accidents in emergency landing situations, particularly in complex,
unstructured, urban scenarios, densely populated with moving risky obstacles,
while potentiating the true capabilities of UAVs in complex urban operations.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in foundation models, including Large Language Models,
Vision-Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, and
Vision-Language-Action Models have opened new avenues for embodied AI in mobile
service robotics. By combining foundation models with the principles of
embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through
physical interactions, robots can improve understanding, adapt to, and execute
complex tasks in dynamic real-world environments. However, embodied AI in
mobile service robots continues to face key challenges, including multimodal
sensor fusion, real-time decision-making under uncertainty, task
generalization, and effective human-robot interactions (HRI). In this paper, we
present the first systematic review of the integration of foundation models in
mobile service robotics, identifying key open challenges in embodied AI and
examining how foundation models can address them. Namely, we explore the role
of such models in enabling real-time sensor fusion, language-conditioned
control, and adaptive task execution. Furthermore, we discuss real-world
applications in the domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation
sectors, demonstrating the transformative impact of foundation models on
service robotics. We also include potential future research directions,
emphasizing the need for predictive scaling laws, autonomous long-term
adaptation, and cross-embodiment generalization to enable scalable, efficient,
and robust deployment of foundation models in human-centric robotic systems.

Abstract: Achieving generalizable and precise robotic manipulation across diverse
environments remains a critical challenge, largely due to limitations in
spatial perception. While prior imitation-learning approaches have made
progress, their reliance on raw RGB inputs and handcrafted features often leads
to overfitting and poor 3D reasoning under varied lighting, occlusion, and

robust multimodal perception with reliable grasp prediction. Our architecture
fuses domain-randomized augmentation, monocular depth estimation, and a
depth-aware 6-DoF Grasp Prompt into a single spatial representation for
downstream action planning. Conditioned on this encoding and a high-level task
prompt, our diffusion-based policy yields precise action sequences, achieving
up to 40% improvement in grasp success and 45% higher task success rates under
environmental variation. These results demonstrate that spatially grounded
perception, paired with diffusion-based imitation learning, offers a scalable
and robust solution for general-purpose robotic grasping.

Abstract: Learning visual representations from observing actions to benefit robot
visuo-motor policy generation is a promising direction that closely resembles
human cognitive function and perception. Motivated by this, and further
inspired by psychological theories suggesting that humans process scenes in an
object-based fashion, we propose an object-centric encoder that performs
semantic segmentation and visual representation generation in a coupled manner,
unlike other works, which treat these as separate processes. To achieve this,
we leverage the Slot Attention mechanism and use the SOLV model, pretrained in
large out-of-domain datasets, to bootstrap fine-tuning on human action video
data. Through simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that visual
representations can enhance reinforcement and imitation learning training,
highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated approach for semantic
segmentation and encoding. Furthermore, we show that exploiting models
pretrained on out-of-domain datasets can benefit this process, and that
fine-tuning on datasets depicting human actions -- although still out-of-domain
-- , can significantly improve performance due to close alignment with robotic
tasks. These findings show the capability to reduce reliance on annotated or
robot-specific action datasets and the potential to build on existing visual
encoders to accelerate training and improve generalizability.

*Yao Huang,Yitong Sun,Shouwei Ruan,Yichi Zhang,Yinpeng Dong,Xingxing Wei*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于ELM理论和遗传优化的新框架，通过扩展策略空间显著提升了对抗安全对齐模型的能力，实验显示在Claude-3.5上成功率超过90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有方法通过提示工程提升了对抗能力，但其效果受限于预定义策略空间，难以应对安全对齐模型。

Method: 将越狱策略分解为基于ELM理论的核心组件，并开发了遗传优化与意图评估机制。

Result: 在Claude-3.5上成功率超过90%，且具有跨模型迁移能力，超越了专用防护模型的评估准确性。

Conclusion: 扩展策略空间是提升对抗能力的有效途径，新框架为模型安全性研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite advanced general capabilities, still
suffer from numerous safety risks, especially jailbreak attacks that bypass
safety protocols. Understanding these vulnerabilities through black-box
jailbreak attacks, which better reflect real-world scenarios, offers critical
insights into model robustness. While existing methods have shown improvements
through various prompt engineering techniques, their success remains limited
against safety-aligned models, overlooking a more fundamental problem: the
effectiveness is inherently bounded by the predefined strategy spaces. However,
expanding this space presents significant challenges in both systematically
capturing essential attack patterns and efficiently navigating the increased
complexity. To better explore the potential of expanding the strategy space, we
address these challenges through a novel framework that decomposes jailbreak
strategies into essential components based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model
(ELM) theory and develops genetic-based optimization with intention evaluation
mechanisms. To be striking, our experiments reveal unprecedented jailbreak
capabilities by expanding the strategy space: we achieve over 90% success rate
on Claude-3.5 where prior methods completely fail, while demonstrating strong
cross-model transferability and surpassing specialized safeguard models in
evaluation accuracy. The code is open-sourced at:

*Taehyo Kim,Qiran Jia,Mony J. de Leon,Hai Shu*

Main category: stat.ML

TLDR: 提出了一种名为fcHMRF-LIS的空间FDR控制方法，解决了神经影像数据分析中的多重测试问题，具有高效、稳定和可扩展的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经影像数据分析中，传统的FDR控制方法假设测试独立，导致高假阴性率，且现有空间FDR方法难以同时解决复杂空间依赖性、FDP和FNP的稳定性及计算可扩展性三大挑战。

Method: 结合局部显著性指数（LIS）和新型全连接隐马尔可夫随机场（fcHMRF），采用高效的期望最大化算法，结合均值场近似、CRF-RNN技术和permutohedral lattice滤波，将计算复杂度从二次降至线性。

Result: 模拟实验显示，fcHMRF-LIS能准确控制FDR，降低FNR，减少FDP和FNP的变异性，并提高真阳性率。应用于ADNI的FDG-PET数据，识别出神经生物学相关脑区，计算效率显著。

Conclusion: fcHMRF-LIS是一种高效、稳定且可扩展的空间FDR控制方法，适用于神经影像数据分析，优于现有方法。

Abstract: False discovery rate (FDR) control methods are essential for voxel-wise
multiple testing in neuroimaging data analysis, where hundreds of thousands or
even millions of tests are conducted to detect brain regions associated with
disease-related changes. Classical FDR control methods (e.g., BH, q-value, and
LocalFDR) assume independence among tests and often lead to high false
non-discovery rates (FNR). Although various spatial FDR control methods have
been developed to improve power, they still fall short in jointly addressing
three major challenges in neuroimaging applications: capturing complex spatial
dependencies, maintaining low variability in both false discovery proportion
(FDP) and false non-discovery proportion (FNP) across replications, and
achieving computational scalability for high-resolution data. To address these
challenges, we propose fcHMRF-LIS, a powerful, stable, and scalable spatial FDR
control method for voxel-wise multiple testing. It integrates the local index
of significance (LIS)-based testing procedure with a novel fully connected
hidden Markov random field (fcHMRF) designed to model complex spatial
structures using a parsimonious parameterization. We develop an efficient
expectation-maximization algorithm incorporating mean-field approximation, the
Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) technique, and
permutohedral lattice filtering, reducing the computational complexity from
quadratic to linear in the number of tests. Extensive simulations demonstrate
that fcHMRF-LIS achieves accurate FDR control, lower FNR, reduced variability
in FDP and FNP, and a higher number of true positives compared to existing
methods. Applied to an FDG-PET dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative, fcHMRF-LIS identifies neurobiologically relevant brain
regions and offers notable advantages in computational efficiency.

TLDR: LazyVLM是一种神经符号视频分析系统，结合了视觉语言模型的灵活性和高效性，通过分解查询和关系查询执行解决了可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频分析方法在灵活性和效率之间存在权衡，视觉语言模型处理长上下文时计算成本高，神经符号方法依赖手动标记和固定规则。

Method: LazyVLM通过半结构化文本接口分解多帧视频查询为细粒度操作，利用关系查询执行和向量相似性搜索提高效率。

Result: LazyVLM为开放域视频数据提供了高效、用户友好的查询解决方案。

Conclusion: LazyVLM在灵活性和效率之间取得了平衡，适用于大规模视频分析。

Abstract: Current video analytics approaches face a fundamental trade-off between
flexibility and efficiency. End-to-end Vision Language Models (VLMs) often
struggle with long-context processing and incur high computational costs, while
neural-symbolic methods depend heavily on manual labeling and rigid rule
design. In this paper, we introduce LazyVLM, a neuro-symbolic video analytics
system that provides a user-friendly query interface similar to VLMs, while
addressing their scalability limitation. LazyVLM enables users to effortlessly
drop in video data and specify complex multi-frame video queries using a
semi-structured text interface for video analytics. To address the scalability
limitations of VLMs, LazyVLM decomposes multi-frame video queries into
fine-grained operations and offloads the bulk of the processing to efficient
relational query execution and vector similarity search. We demonstrate that
LazyVLM provides a robust, efficient, and user-friendly solution for querying
open-domain video data at scale.

TLDR: EmoCorrector是一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的文本语音编辑（TSE）后校正方案，旨在解决现有TSE方法中情感不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TSE方法主要关注内容准确性和声学一致性，但忽视了文本修改可能导致的情感不一致问题。

Method: EmoCorrector通过提取编辑文本的情感特征，检索匹配情感的语音样本，并合成符合目标情感的语音，同时保留说话者身份和音质。

Result: 实验表明，EmoCorrector显著提升了目标情感的表达，并解决了现有TSE方法的情感不一致问题。

Conclusion: EmoCorrector为TSE中的情感一致性提供了有效解决方案，并通过ECD-TSE数据集支持了相关研究和评估。

Abstract: Text-based speech editing (TSE) modifies speech using only text, eliminating
re-recording. However, existing TSE methods, mainly focus on the content
accuracy and acoustic consistency of synthetic speech segments, and often
overlook the emotional shifts or inconsistency issues introduced by text
changes. To address this issue, we propose EmoCorrector, a novel
post-correction scheme for TSE. EmoCorrector leverages Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) by extracting the edited text's emotional features, retrieving
speech samples with matching emotions, and synthesizing speech that aligns with
the desired emotion while preserving the speaker's identity and quality. To
support the training and evaluation of emotional consistency modeling in TSE,
we pioneer the benchmarking Emotion Correction Dataset for TSE (ECD-TSE). The
prominent aspect of ECD-TSE is its inclusion of $<$text, speech$>$ paired data
featuring diverse text variations and a range of emotional expressions.
Subjective and objective experiments and comprehensive analysis on ECD-TSE
confirm that EmoCorrector significantly enhances the expression of intended
emotion while addressing emotion inconsistency limitations in current TSE
methods. Code and audio examples are available at

Method: 通过评估十种ASR系统（包括商业和开源模型），分析性能差异和偏见，并提出新的加权替换错误指标。

Result: 研究发现ASR模型在标准波斯语上表现良好，但在方言、儿童语音和特定语言挑战上表现不佳。

Conclusion: PSRB为波斯语ASR研究提供了宝贵资源，并可作为其他低资源语言基准开发的框架。

Abstract: Although Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have become an integral
part of modern technology, their evaluation remains challenging, particularly
for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper introduces Persian
Speech Recognition Benchmark(PSRB), a comprehensive benchmark designed to
address this gap by incorporating diverse linguistic and acoustic conditions.
We evaluate ten ASR systems, including state-of-the-art commercial and
open-source models, to examine performance variations and inherent biases.
Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Persian ASR transcriptions,
identifying key error types and proposing a novel metric that weights
substitution errors. This metric enhances evaluation robustness by reducing the
impact of minor and partial errors, thereby improving the precision of
performance assessment. Our findings indicate that while ASR models generally
perform well on standard Persian, they struggle with regional accents,
children's speech, and specific linguistic challenges. These results highlight
the necessity of fine-tuning and incorporating diverse, representative training
datasets to mitigate biases and enhance overall ASR performance. PSRB provides
a valuable resource for advancing ASR research in Persian and serves as a
framework for developing benchmarks in other low-resource languages. A subset
of the PSRB dataset is publicly available at

TLDR: 研究探讨了聊天机器人框架（熟悉型与陌生型）对用户自我披露的影响，发现情感披露时陌生型更舒适，而事实披露时熟悉型更受欢迎。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聊天机器人日益用于自我披露，但其框架对用户行为的影响尚不明确。

Method: 采用混合因子设计，比较熟悉型（记忆过去互动）与陌生型（每次新对话）聊天机器人在情感和事实披露中的表现。

Result: 情感披露时陌生型更舒适，事实披露时熟悉型更受欢迎；定性结果显示陌生型提供匿名性，熟悉型需通过低风险事实披露建立信任。

Conclusion: 聊天机器人框架需根据披露类型调整，陌生型适合情感披露，熟悉型需逐步建立信任。

Abstract: Self-disclosure, the sharing of one's thoughts and feelings, is affected by
the perceived relationship between individuals. While chatbots are increasingly
used for self-disclosure, the impact of a chatbot's framing on users'
self-disclosure remains under-explored. We investigated how a chatbot's
description of its relationship with users, particularly in terms of
ephemerality, affects self-disclosure. Specifically, we compared a Familiar
chatbot, presenting itself as a companion remembering past interactions, with a
Stranger chatbot, presenting itself as a new, unacquainted entity in each
conversation. In a mixed factorial design, participants engaged with either the
Familiar or Stranger chatbot in two sessions across two days, with one
conversation focusing on Emotional- and another Factual-disclosure. When
Emotional-disclosure was sought in the first chatting session,
Stranger-condition participants felt more comfortable self-disclosing. However,
when Factual-disclosure was sought first, these differences were replaced by
more enjoyment among Familiar-condition participants. Qualitative findings
showed Stranger afforded anonymity and reduced judgement, whereas Familiar
sometimes felt intrusive unless rapport was built via low-risk
Factual-disclosure.

Main category: cs.HC

TLDR: 本文提出了一种理论驱动的偏见检测框架和社交刻板印象指数（SSI），用于系统评估文本到图像（T2I）生成模型中的社会偏见。通过分析三个主流T2I模型的输出，发现初始结果普遍存在刻板印象，但通过提示优化显著减少了偏见。用户研究表明，尽管去偏见化有效，但可能牺牲上下文一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在视觉内容创作中表现出色，但T2I模型常放大社会刻板印象（如性别、种族、文化），引发伦理问题。本文旨在系统评估和减少这些偏见。

Method: 提出SSI和偏见检测框架，审计DALL-E-3、Midjourney-6.1和Stability AI Core的100个查询输出（分地理文化、职业和形容词三类）。通过LLM优化提示以减少偏见。

Result: 提示优化使SSI显著下降（地理文化降61%，职业降69%，形容词降51%）。用户研究发现去偏见化可能影响上下文一致性，且用户更倾向于刻板印象图像。

Conclusion: 需平衡伦理去偏见与上下文相关性，呼吁开发支持全球多样性的T2I系统，同时保留社会复杂性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled visual content creation through
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, despite their creative potential, T2I
models often replicate and amplify societal stereotypes -- particularly those
related to gender, race, and culture -- raising important ethical concerns.
This paper proposes a theory-driven bias detection rubric and a Social
Stereotype Index (SSI) to systematically evaluate social biases in T2I outputs.
We audited three major T2I model outputs -- DALL-E-3, Midjourney-6.1, and
Stability AI Core -- using 100 queries across three categories -- geocultural,
occupational, and adjectival. Our analysis reveals that initial outputs are
prone to include stereotypical visual cues, including gendered professions,
cultural markers, and western beauty norms. To address this, we adopted our
rubric to conduct targeted prompt refinement using LLMs, which significantly
reduced bias -- SSI dropped by 61% for geocultural, 69% for occupational, and
51% for adjectival queries. We complemented our quantitative analysis through a
user study examining perceptions, awareness, and preferences around
AI-generated biased imagery. Our findings reveal a key tension -- although
prompt refinement can mitigate stereotypes, it can limit contextual alignment.
Interestingly, users often perceived stereotypical images to be more aligned
with their expectations. We discuss the need to balance ethical debiasing with
contextual relevance and call for T2I systems that support global diversity and
inclusivity while not compromising the reflection of real-world social
complexity.

creative workflows are coordinated. This is the first survey dedicated to
creativity in MAS. We focus on text and image generation tasks, and present:
(1) a taxonomy of agent proactivity and persona design; (2) an overview of
generation techniques, including divergent exploration, iterative refinement,
and collaborative synthesis, as well as relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics; and (3) a discussion of key challenges, such as inconsistent
evaluation standards, insufficient bias mitigation, coordination conflicts, and
the lack of unified benchmarks. This survey offers a structured framework and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感计算中多标注者数据常被合并为单一标签，丢失了标注者间的差异性，希望利用这些差异性提升模型性能。

Method: 使用共识网络整合多标注者数据，指导主预测器（唤醒-效价）更好地反映集体输入。

Result: 在RECOLA和COGNIMUSE数据集上表现优于传统单标签方法。

Conclusion: 多标注者数据的充分利用在情感识别中具有优势，适用于标注丰富但不一致的领域。

Abstract: In affective computing, datasets often contain multiple annotations from
different annotators, which may lack full agreement. Typically, these
annotations are merged into a single gold standard label, potentially losing
valuable inter-rater variability. We propose a multi-annotator training
approach for continuous emotion recognition (CER) that seeks a consensus across
all annotators rather than relying on a single reference label. Our method
employs a consensus network to aggregate annotations into a unified
representation, guiding the main arousal-valence predictor to better reflect
collective inputs. Tested on the RECOLA and COGNIMUSE datasets, our approach
outperforms traditional methods that unify annotations into a single label.
This underscores the benefits of fully leveraging multi-annotator data in
emotion recognition and highlights its applicability across various fields
where annotations are abundant yet inconsistent.

Conclusion: Project Riley在结构化场景中表现出色，为情感化AI交互提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper presents Project Riley, a novel multimodal and multi-model
conversational AI architecture oriented towards the simulation of reasoning
influenced by emotional states. Drawing inspiration from Pixar's Inside Out,
the system comprises five distinct emotional agents - Joy, Sadness, Fear,
Anger, and Disgust - that engage in structured multi-round dialogues to
generate, criticise, and iteratively refine responses. A final reasoning
mechanism synthesises the contributions of these agents into a coherent output
that either reflects the dominant emotion or integrates multiple perspectives.
The architecture incorporates both textual and visual large language models
(LLMs), alongside advanced reasoning and self-refinement processes. A
functional prototype was deployed locally in an offline environment, optimised
for emotional expressiveness and computational efficiency. From this initial
prototype, another one emerged, called Armando, which was developed for use in
emergency contexts, delivering emotionally calibrated and factually accurate
information through the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
cumulative context tracking. The Project Riley prototype was evaluated through
user testing, in which participants interacted with the chatbot and completed a
structured questionnaire assessing three dimensions: Emotional Appropriateness,
Clarity and Utility, and Naturalness and Human-likeness. The results indicate
strong performance in structured scenarios, particularly with respect to
emotional alignment and communicative clarity.

Result: 发现两种扩展范式在扩展预算达到阈值后收益递减，且其数学结构在理论上趋于统一。

Conclusion: 为测试时扩展的成本效益权衡提供了见解，指导开发更高效的推理策略。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited the capacity of enhancing
reasoning performance via internal test-time scaling. Building upon this, a
promising direction is to further scale test-time compute to unlock even
greater reasoning capabilities. However, as we push these scaling boundaries,
systematically understanding the practical limits and achieving optimal
resource allocation becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, we investigate
the scaling Pareto of test-time scaling and introduce the Test-Time Scaling
Performance Model (TTSPM). We theoretically analyze two fundamental paradigms
for such extended scaling, parallel scaling and sequential scaling, from a
probabilistic modeling perspective. Our primary contribution is the derivation
of the saturation point on the scaling budget for both strategies, identifying
thresholds beyond which additional computation yields diminishing returns.
Remarkably, despite their distinct mechanisms, both paradigms converge to a
unified mathematical structure in their upper bounds. We empirically validate
our theoretical findings on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH-500, and GPQA, demonstrating the practical utility of these bounds for
test-time resource allocation. We hope that this work provides insights into
the cost-benefit trade-offs of test-time scaling, guiding the development of
more resource-efficient inference strategies for large reasoning models.

Abstract: Objective To develop an LLM based realtime compound diagnostic medical AI
interface and performed a clinical trial comparing this interface and
physicians for common internal medicine cases based on the United States
Medical License Exam (USMLE) Step 2 Clinical Skill (CS) style exams. Methods A
nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted on August 20, 2024. We recruited one
general physician, two internal medicine residents (2nd and 3rd year), and five
simulated patients. The clinical vignettes were adapted from the USMLE Step 2
CS style exams. We developed 10 representative internal medicine cases based on
actual patients and included information available on initial diagnostic
evaluation. Primary outcome was the accuracy of the first differential
diagnosis. Repeatability was evaluated based on the proportion of agreement.
Results The accuracy of the physicians' first differential diagnosis ranged
from 50% to 70%, whereas the realtime compound diagnostic medical AI interface
achieved an accuracy of 80%. The proportion of agreement for the first
differential diagnosis was 0.7. The accuracy of the first and second
differential diagnoses ranged from 70% to 90% for physicians, whereas the AI
interface achieved an accuracy rate of 100%. The average time for the AI
interface (557 sec) was 44.6% shorter than that of the physicians (1006 sec).
The AI interface ($0.08) also reduced costs by 98.1% compared to the
physicians' average ($4.2). Patient satisfaction scores ranged from 4.2 to 4.3
for care by physicians and were 3.9 for the AI interface Conclusion An LLM
based realtime compound diagnostic medical AI interface demonstrated diagnostic
accuracy and patient satisfaction comparable to those of a physician, while
requiring less time and lower costs. These findings suggest that AI interfaces
may have the potential to assist primary care consultations for common internal

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model capabilities in recent years, a
large gap remains in their capabilities and safety performance for many
languages beyond a relatively small handful of globally dominant languages.
This paper provides researchers, policymakers and governance experts with an
overview of key challenges to bridging the "language gap" in AI and minimizing
safety risks across languages. We provide an analysis of why the language gap
in AI exists and grows, and how it creates disparities in global AI safety. We
identify barriers to address these challenges, and recommend how those working
in policy and governance can help address safety concerns associated with the
language gap by supporting multilingual dataset creation, transparency, and
research.

### [328] [MME-Reasoning: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Logical Reasoning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21327)
*Jiakang Yuan,Tianshuo Peng,Yilei Jiang,Yiting Lu,Renrui Zhang,Kaituo Feng,Chaoyou Fu,Tao Chen,Lei Bai,Bo Zhang,Xiangyu Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 论文提出了MME-Reasoning基准，全面评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的逻辑推理能力，涵盖归纳、演绎和溯因推理，揭示了当前先进模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能全面评估MLLMs的逻辑推理能力，缺乏明确的推理类型分类和对推理能力的清晰理解。

Method: 设计MME-Reasoning基准，涵盖三种推理类型，精心筛选数据以确保问题有效评估推理能力而非感知技能或知识广度。

Result: 评估显示，即使最先进的MLLMs在全面逻辑推理中也表现有限，且在不同推理类型间存在显著性能不平衡。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前MLLMs在逻辑推理中的关键局限性，为理解和评估推理能力提供了系统见解。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence and an
essential capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite the
significant advancement in multimodal reasoning, existing benchmarks fail to
comprehensively evaluate their reasoning abilities due to the lack of explicit
categorization for logical reasoning types and an unclear understanding of
reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce MME-Reasoning, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of MLLMs, which covers all
three types of reasoning (i.e., inductive, deductive, and abductive) in its
questions. We carefully curate the data to ensure that each question
effectively evaluates reasoning ability rather than perceptual skills or
knowledge breadth, and extend the evaluation protocols to cover the evaluation
of diverse questions. Our evaluation reveals substantial limitations of
state-of-the-art MLLMs when subjected to holistic assessments of logical
reasoning capabilities. Even the most advanced MLLMs show limited performance
in comprehensive logical reasoning, with notable performance imbalances across
reasoning types. In addition, we conducted an in-depth analysis of approaches
such as ``thinking mode'' and Rule-based RL, which are commonly believed to
enhance reasoning abilities. These findings highlight the critical limitations
and performance imbalances of current MLLMs in diverse logical reasoning
scenarios, providing comprehensive and systematic insights into the
understanding and evaluation of reasoning capabilities.

### [329] [Optimizing fMRI Data Acquisition for Decoding Natural Speech with Limited Participants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21304)
*Louis Jalouzot,Alexis Thual,Yair Lakretz,Christophe Pallier,Bertrand Thirion*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TLDR: 研究探讨了从少量参与者的fMRI数据中解码自然语音的最优策略，发现多参与者训练对解码准确性无显著提升，且解码器更擅长建模句法特征而非语义特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在有限参与者数据下，如何优化从fMRI数据解码自然语音的策略，并评估多参与者训练和不同刺激条件的影响。

Method: 使用深度神经网络预测LLM衍生的文本表示，比较单参与者和多参与者训练的效果，并分析句法和语义特征的解码表现。

Result: 多参与者训练未提升解码准确性；解码器更擅长句法特征；复杂句法或丰富语义内容增加解码难度。

Conclusion: 深度表型分析（每个参与者大量数据）对解码更有效，多参与者策略需更大样本或更深表型。

Abstract: We investigate optimal strategies for decoding perceived natural speech from
fMRI data acquired from a limited number of participants. Leveraging Lebel et
al. (2023)'s dataset of 8 participants, we first demonstrate the effectiveness
of training deep neural networks to predict LLM-derived text representations
from fMRI activity. Then, in this data regime, we observe that multi-subject
training does not improve decoding accuracy compared to single-subject
approach. Furthermore, training on similar or different stimuli across subjects
has a negligible effect on decoding accuracy. Finally, we find that our
decoders better model syntactic than semantic features, and that stories
containing sentences with complex syntax or rich semantic content are more
challenging to decode. While our results demonstrate the benefits of having
extensive data per participant (deep phenotyping), they suggest that leveraging
multi-subject for natural speech decoding likely requires deeper phenotyping or
a substantially larger cohort.

### [330] [ART-DECO: Arbitrary Text Guidance for 3D Detailizer Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20431)
*Qimin Chen,Yuezhi Yang,Yifang Wang,Vladimir G. Kim,Siddhartha Chaudhuri,Hao Zhang,Zhiqin Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为3D detailizer的神经模型，能够快速将粗糙的3D形状转换为高质量资产，并通过文本提示控制细节生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到3D生成模型在细节控制和交互性上存在不足，需要一种能够快速生成高质量3D资产且支持用户交互的方法。

Method: 模型通过两阶段训练，利用预训练的多视图图像扩散模型和Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)技术，将生成知识蒸馏到detailizer中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的3D形状在质量和细节上优于现有文本到3D模型，且支持实时交互。

Conclusion: 3D detailizer在生成高质量3D资产、支持用户控制和泛化能力方面表现出色，为交互式3D建模提供了新可能。

Abstract: We introduce a 3D detailizer, a neural model which can instantaneously (in
<1s) transform a coarse 3D shape proxy into a high-quality asset with detailed
geometry and texture as guided by an input text prompt. Our model is trained
using the text prompt, which defines the shape class and characterizes the
appearance and fine-grained style of the generated details. The coarse 3D
proxy, which can be easily varied and adjusted (e.g., via user editing),
provides structure control over the final shape. Importantly, our detailizer is
not optimized for a single shape; it is the result of distilling a generative
model, so that it can be reused, without retraining, to generate any number of
shapes, with varied structures, whose local details all share a consistent
style and appearance. Our detailizer training utilizes a pretrained multi-view
image diffusion model, with text conditioning, to distill the foundational
knowledge therein into our detailizer via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To
improve SDS and enable our detailizer architecture to learn generalizable
features over complex structures, we train our model in two training stages to
generate shapes with increasing structural complexity. Through extensive
experiments, we show that our method generates shapes of superior quality and
details compared to existing text-to-3D models under varied structure control.
Our detailizer can refine a coarse shape in less than a second, making it
possible to interactively author and adjust 3D shapes. Furthermore, the
user-imposed structure control can lead to creative, and hence
out-of-distribution, 3D asset generations that are beyond the current
capabilities of leading text-to-3D generative models. We demonstrate an
interactive 3D modeling workflow our method enables, and its strong
generalizability over styles, structures, and object categories.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种任务和表示中表现优异，甚至优于定制层次结构。

Conclusion: 随机预条件方法简单高效，为神经场拟合提供了统一且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural fields are a highly effective representation across visual computing.
This work observes that fitting these fields is greatly improved by
incorporating spatial stochasticity during training, and that this simple
technique can replace or even outperform custom-designed hierarchies and
frequency space constructions. The approach is formalized as implicitly
operating on a blurred version of the field, evaluated in-expectation by
sampling with Gaussian-distributed offsets. Querying the blurred field during
optimization greatly improves convergence and robustness, akin to the role of
preconditioners in numerical linear algebra. This implicit, sampling-based
perspective fits naturally into the neural field paradigm, comes at no
additional cost, and is extremely simple to implement. We describe the basic
theory of this technique, including details such as handling boundary
conditions, and extending to a spatially-varying blur. Experiments demonstrate
this approach on representations including coordinate MLPs, neural hashgrids,
triplanes, and more, across tasks including surface reconstruction and radiance
fields. In settings where custom-designed hierarchies have already been
developed, stochastic preconditioning nearly matches or improves their
performance with a simple and unified approach; in settings without existing
hierarchies it provides an immediate boost to quality and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模城市场景的精确高效建模对AR导航、无人机巡检和智慧城市数字孪生至关重要，但现有方法存在遮挡、几何不完整和高内存需求等问题。

Method: CityGo首先从MVS点云提取紧凑的建筑代理网格，使用零阶SH高斯生成无遮挡纹理，并通过残差高斯捕捉高频细节。周围高斯表示城市背景，采用重要性感知下采样减少冗余。

Result: 实验表明，CityGo显著减少训练时间（平均1.4倍加速），在移动GPU上实现实时渲染，且内存和能耗大幅降低。

Conclusion: CityGo通过混合表示实现了高效、逼真的城市场景渲染，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of large-scale urban scenes is critical for
applications such as AR navigation, UAV based inspection, and smart city
digital twins. While aerial imagery offers broad coverage and complements
limitations of ground-based data, reconstructing city-scale environments from
such views remains challenging due to occlusions, incomplete geometry, and high
memory demands. Recent advances like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) improve
scalability and visual quality but remain limited by dense primitive usage,
long training times, and poor suit ability for edge devices. We propose CityGo,
a hybrid framework that combines textured proxy geometry with residual and
surrounding 3D Gaussians for lightweight, photorealistic rendering of urban
scenes from aerial perspectives. Our approach first extracts compact building
proxy meshes from MVS point clouds, then uses zero order SH Gaussians to
generate occlusion-free textures via image-based rendering and back-projection.
To capture high-frequency details, we introduce residual Gaussians placed based
on proxy-photo discrepancies and guided by depth priors. Broader urban context
is represented by surrounding Gaussians, with importance-aware downsampling
applied to non-critical regions to reduce redundancy. A tailored optimization
strategy jointly refines proxy textures and Gaussian parameters, enabling
real-time rendering of complex urban scenes on mobile GPUs with significantly
reduced training and memory requirements. Extensive experiments on real-world
aerial datasets demonstrate that our hybrid representation significantly
reduces training time, achieving on average 1.4x speedup, while delivering
comparable visual fidelity to pure 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches.
Furthermore, CityGo enables real-time rendering of large-scale urban scenes on
mobile consumer GPUs, with substantially reduced memory usage and energy
consumption.

TLDR: IKMo是一种基于扩散模型的两阶段运动生成方法，通过解耦轨迹和姿态输入，结合ControlNet生成高质量运动。实验证明其在轨迹关键帧约束下优于现有方法，并通过MLLM代理提升用户期望匹配度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对轨迹和姿态进行全局处理导致输出不理想，需改进运动生成的保真度和可控性。

Method: 采用两阶段条件框架：第一阶段优化输入，第二阶段通过并行编码器和ControlNet生成运动。MLLM代理预处理用户输入。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上表现最优，用户研究表明MLLM代理提升生成运动与用户期望的一致性。

Conclusion: IKMo通过解耦和两阶段处理显著提升了运动生成的保真度和可控性，MLLM代理进一步优化了用户体验。

Abstract: Existing human motion generation methods with trajectory and pose inputs
operate global processing on both modalities, leading to suboptimal outputs. In
this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based
on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory
and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first
stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the
second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a
Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity
is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose
data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under
trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented
to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the
agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the
optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study
with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents
pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We
believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability
of motion generation by the diffusion model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经网络方法参数过多，限制了实际应用，因此需要一种更高效的函数逼近方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于多项式插值和径向基函数的紧凑表示，并开发了内存优化的CUDA算法。

Result: 在3D符号距离函数实验中，性能优于或媲美现有技术，且参数更少。

Conclusion: 该方法为函数逼近提供了一种高效、实用的替代方案。

Abstract: Function fitting/approximation plays a fundamental role in computer graphics
and other engineering applications. While recent advances have explored neural
networks to address this task, these methods often rely on architectures with
many parameters, limiting their practical applicability. In contrast, we pursue
high-quality function approximation using parameter-efficient representations
that eliminate the dependency on neural networks entirely. We first propose a
novel framework for continuous function modeling. Most existing works can be
formulated using this framework. We then introduce a compact function
representation, which is based on polynomials interpolated using radial basis
functions, bypassing both neural networks and complex/hierarchical data
structures. We also develop memory-efficient CUDA-optimized algorithms that
reduce computational time and memory consumption to less than 10% compared to
conventional automatic differentiation frameworks. Finally, we validate our
representation and optimization pipeline through extensive experiments on 3D
signed distance functions (SDFs). The proposed representation achieves
comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art techniques (e.g.,
octree/hash-grid techniques) with significantly fewer parameters.

Motivation: 现有神经3D表示方法（如NeRF和3DGS）只能估计可见的外部结构，无法捕捉内部结构。论文旨在通过碰撞过程中的外观变化解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SfC-NeRF模型，通过视频序列优化物体的内部结构，结合物理约束、外观保持约束和关键帧约束。为避免陷入局部最优，提出体积退火策略。

Result: 在115个不同结构和材料的物体上进行了实验，验证了SfC-NeRF的有效性。

Conclusion: SfC-NeRF能够有效估计物体的内部结构，为神经3D表示提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural 3D representations, such as neural radiance
fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), have enabled the accurate
estimation of 3D structures from multiview images. However, this capability is
limited to estimating the visible external structure, and identifying the
invisible internal structure hidden behind the surface is difficult. To
overcome this limitation, we address a new task called Structure from Collision
(SfC), which aims to estimate the structure (including the invisible internal
structure) of an object from appearance changes during collision. To solve this
problem, we propose a novel model called SfC-NeRF that optimizes the invisible
internal structure of an object through a video sequence under physical,
appearance (i.e., visible external structure)-preserving, and keyframe
constraints. In particular, to avoid falling into undesirable local optima
owing to its ill-posed nature, we propose volume annealing; that is, searching
for global optima by repeatedly reducing and expanding the volume. Extensive
experiments on 115 objects involving diverse structures (i.e., various cavity
shapes, locations, and sizes) and material properties revealed the properties
of SfC and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed SfC-NeRF.

TLDR: 提出了一种协调扩散噪声优化框架，用于合成全身操纵关节物体的动作，包括身体、手部和物体运动，解决了协调性和精确性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全身操纵关节物体在虚拟人类和机器人领域有广泛应用，但协调身体与手部动作以及高自由度精确操作是核心挑战。

Method: 采用三个专用扩散模型（身体、左手、右手）进行噪声空间优化，通过梯度流实现协调；使用基础点集（BPS）统一表示手与物体的空间关系。

Conclusion: 该方法通过协调扩散噪声优化和BPS表示，显著提升了全身操纵关节物体的动作合成效果。

Abstract: Synthesizing whole-body manipulation of articulated objects, including body
motion, hand motion, and object motion, is a critical yet challenging task with
broad applications in virtual humans and robotics. The core challenges are
twofold. First, achieving realistic whole-body motion requires tight
coordination between the hands and the rest of the body, as their movements are
interdependent during manipulation. Second, articulated object manipulation
typically involves high degrees of freedom and demands higher precision, often
requiring the fingers to be placed at specific regions to actuate movable
parts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel coordinated diffusion
noise optimization framework. Specifically, we perform noise-space optimization
over three specialized diffusion models for the body, left hand, and right
hand, each trained on its own motion dataset to improve generalization.
Coordination naturally emerges through gradient flow along the human kinematic
chain, allowing the global body posture to adapt in response to hand motion
objectives with high fidelity. To further enhance precision in hand-object
interaction, we adopt a unified representation based on basis point sets (BPS),
where end-effector positions are encoded as distances to the same BPS used for
object geometry. This unified representation captures fine-grained spatial
relationships between the hand and articulated object parts, and the resulting
trajectories serve as targets to guide the optimization of diffusion noise,
producing highly accurate interaction motion. We conduct extensive experiments
demonstrating that our method outperforms existing approaches in motion quality
and physical plausibility, and enables various capabilities such as object pose
control, simultaneous walking and manipulation, and whole-body generation from
hand-only data.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为HiREC的分层检索与证据整理框架，用于解决传统RAG方法在金融标准化文档中因相似格式导致的重复检索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准化金融文档（如SEC文件）格式相似，传统RAG方法容易误判重复文本，影响准确性和完整性。

Method: HiREC框架通过分层检索（先检索相关文档，再选择最相关段落）和证据整理（去除无关段落，必要时生成补充查询）来优化检索过程。

Result: 构建并发布了包含145,897份SEC文档和1,595个问答对的大规模开放域金融问答基准（LOFin）。

Conclusion: HiREC框架有效解决了金融文档中的重复检索问题，提升了检索的准确性和完整性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based large language models (LLMs) are
widely used in finance for their excellent performance on knowledge-intensive
tasks. However, standardized documents (e.g., SEC filing) share similar formats
such as repetitive boilerplate texts, and similar table structures. This
similarity forces traditional RAG methods to misidentify near-duplicate text,
leading to duplicate retrieval that undermines accuracy and completeness. To
address these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Retrieval with Evidence
Curation (HiREC) framework. Our approach first performs hierarchical retrieval
to reduce confusion among similar texts. It first retrieve related documents
and then selects the most relevant passages from the documents. The evidence
curation process removes irrelevant passages. When necessary, it automatically
generates complementary queries to collect missing information. To evaluate our
approach, we construct and release a Large-scale Open-domain Financial (LOFin)
question answering benchmark that includes 145,897 SEC documents and 1,595
question-answer pairs. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/deep-over/LOFin-bench-HiREC.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能够有效利用用户-物品交互数据中的协作信号，填补现有研究的空白。

Result: 当前LLMs在捕捉协作模式上表现不如MF模型，但RAG方法显著提升了推荐质量。

Conclusion: RAG方法为基于LLMs的推荐系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: User-item interactions contain rich collaborative signals that form the
backbone of many successful recommender systems. While recent work has explored
the use of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, it remains unclear
whether LLMs can effectively reason over this type of collaborative
information. In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between LLMs and
classical matrix factorization (MF) models to assess LLMs' ability to leverage
user-item interaction data. We further introduce a simple retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) method that enhances LLMs by grounding their predictions in
structured interaction data. Our experiments reveal that current LLMs often
fall short in capturing collaborative patterns inherent to MF models, but that
our RAG-based approach substantially improves recommendation
quality-highlighting a promising direction for future LLM-based recommenders.

Conclusion: 需改进基准以实现更真实可靠的TUS评估。

Abstract: Recent table representation learning and data discovery methods tackle table
union search (TUS) within data lakes, which involves identifying tables that
can be unioned with a given query table to enrich its content. These methods
are commonly evaluated using benchmarks that aim to assess semantic
understanding in real-world TUS tasks. However, our analysis of prominent TUS
benchmarks reveals several limitations that allow simple baselines to perform
surprisingly well, often outperforming more sophisticated approaches. This
suggests that current benchmark scores are heavily influenced by
dataset-specific characteristics and fail to effectively isolate the gains from
semantic understanding. To address this, we propose essential criteria for
future benchmarks to enable a more realistic and reliable evaluation of
progress in semantic table union search.
