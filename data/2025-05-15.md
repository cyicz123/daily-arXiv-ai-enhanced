### [1] [Human-AI Collaboration or Academic Misconduct? Measuring AI Use in Student Writing Through Stylometric Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08828)
*Eduardo Araujo Oliveira,Madhavi Mohoni,Sonsoles López-Pernas,Mohammed Saqr*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究探讨了如何利用作者验证技术量化AI在学术写作中的辅助作用，旨在提升透明度、可解释性和学生发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人机协作在教育中的普及，理解和测量这种互动的程度和性质面临挑战。

Method: 研究分为三个阶段：数据集选择与扩展、作者验证方法开发、系统评估。使用了三个数据集，包括公共数据集和学生数据，开发了改进的特征向量差异方法。

Result: 改进的作者验证分类器能有效识别风格差异，量化人机协作，并为教育者提供透明工具。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了作者验证技术，为AI时代的学术写作动态提供了实用见解。

Abstract: As human-AI collaboration becomes increasingly prevalent in educational
contexts, understanding and measuring the extent and nature of such
interactions pose significant challenges. This research investigates the use of
authorship verification (AV) techniques not as a punitive measure, but as a
means to quantify AI assistance in academic writing, with a focus on promoting
transparency, interpretability, and student development. Building on prior
work, we structured our investigation into three stages: dataset selection and
expansion, AV method development, and systematic evaluation. Using three
datasets - including a public dataset (PAN-14) and two from University of
Melbourne students from various courses - we expanded the data to include
LLM-generated texts, totalling 1,889 documents and 540 authorship problems from
506 students. We developed an adapted Feature Vector Difference AV methodology
to construct robust academic writing profiles for students, designed to capture
meaningful, individual characteristics of their writing. The method's
effectiveness was evaluated across multiple scenarios, including distinguishing
between student-authored and LLM-generated texts and testing resilience against
LLMs' attempts to mimic student writing styles. Results demonstrate the
enhanced AV classifier's ability to identify stylometric discrepancies and
measure human-AI collaboration at word and sentence levels while providing
educators with a transparent tool to support academic integrity investigations.
This work advances AV technology, offering actionable insights into the
dynamics of academic writing in an AI-driven era.

*Daeun Hwang,Samuel Shields,Alex Calderwood,Shi Johnson-Bey,Michael Mateas,Noah Wardrip-Fruin,Edward F. Melcer*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 比较静态与动态叙事教育游戏对学习动机的影响，发现动态叙事能提升参与度，但需平衡教学与叙事动态性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨动态叙事对学习动机的影响，填补AI驱动动态叙事在教育游戏中的研究空白。

Method: 比较静态分支叙事与动态序列化叙事的两种版本教育游戏Academical。

Result: 动态叙事提升玩家参与度，但需平衡教学目标和叙事动态性。

Conclusion: AI驱动的动态叙事在教育游戏中具有潜力，需进一步探索设计方法。

Abstract: Motivation is an important factor underlying successful learning. Previous
research has demonstrated the positive effects that static interactive
narrative games can have on motivation. Concurrently, advances in AI have made
dynamic and adaptive approaches to interactive narrative increasingly
accessible. However, limited work has explored the impact that dynamic
narratives can have on learner motivation. In this paper, we compare two
versions of Academical, a choice-based educational interactive narrative game
about research ethics. One version employs a traditional hand-authored
branching plot (i.e., static narrative) while the other dynamically sequences
plots during play (i.e., dynamic narrative). Results highlight the importance
of responsive content and a variety of choices for player engagement, while
also illustrating the challenge of balancing pedagogical goals with the dynamic
aspects of narrative. We also discuss design implications that arise from these
findings. Ultimately, this work provides initial steps to illuminate the
emerging potential of AI-driven dynamic narrative in educational games.

### [3] [A suite of LMs comprehend puzzle statements as well as humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08996)
*Adele E Goldberg,Supantho Rakshit,Jennifer Hu,Kyle Mahowald*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究发现，人类语言理解能力被高估，而大型语言模型（如GPT-4）的能力被低估。限制重读后，人类准确率下降至73%，低于Falcon-180B-Chat（76%）和GPT-4（81%）。GPT-o1模型达到完美准确率。结果还显示，人类和模型在涉及互惠动作的查询中表现较差，表明这是共有的语用敏感性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估人类与大型语言模型在语言理解任务中的表现，纠正此前研究中可能的偏差。

Method: 使用相同刺激材料，设计两种条件（允许重读和限制重读）比较人类和模型的表现，并进行预注册研究。

Result: 人类在限制重读条件下准确率显著下降（73%），低于多个模型（Falcon-180B-Chat 76%，GPT-4 81%）。GPT-o1模型表现完美。人类和模型在互惠动作查询中表现较差。

Conclusion: 研究强调实验设计和编码实践需更严谨，并挑战了当前模型在语言理解上弱于人类的假设。

Abstract: Recent claims suggest that large language models (LMs) underperform humans in
comprehending minimally complex English statements (Dentella et al., 2024).
Here, we revisit those findings and argue that human performance was
overestimated, while LLM abilities were underestimated. Using the same stimuli,
we report a preregistered study comparing human responses in two conditions:
one allowed rereading (replicating the original study), and one that restricted
rereading (a more naturalistic comprehension test). Human accuracy dropped
significantly when rereading was restricted (73%), falling below that of
Falcon-180B-Chat (76%) and GPT-4 (81%). The newer GPT-o1 model achieves perfect
accuracy. Results further show that both humans and models are
disproportionately challenged by queries involving potentially reciprocal
actions (e.g., kissing), suggesting shared pragmatic sensitivities rather than
model-specific deficits. Additional analyses using Llama-2-70B log
probabilities, a recoding of open-ended model responses, and grammaticality
ratings of other sentences reveal systematic underestimation of model
performance. We find that GPT-4o can align with either naive or expert
grammaticality judgments, depending on prompt framing. These findings
underscore the need for more careful experimental design and coding practices
in LLM evaluation, and they challenge the assumption that current models are
inherently weaker than humans at language comprehension.

### [4] [For GPT-4 as with Humans: Information Structure Predicts Acceptability of Long-Distance Dependencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09005)
*Nicole Cuneo,Eleanor Graves,Supantho Rakshit,Adele E. Goldberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了语言模型（LM）是否能理解自然语言并生成可靠的元语言判断，以及是否能捕捉形式与功能之间的微妙关系。通过测试GPT-4在信息结构和可接受性任务上的表现，研究发现其能复现人类判断中的交互作用，并揭示了信息结构与句法之间的紧密联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于验证语言模型是否能理解和生成可靠的元语言判断，并探讨其是否能捕捉形式与功能之间的微妙关系。

Method: 研究通过测试GPT-4在信息结构和可接受性任务上的表现，并扩展新的实验（如操纵信息结构），验证其能力。

Result: GPT-4在信息结构和可接受性任务上表现出可靠的元语言能力，复现了人类判断中的交互作用，并证实了信息结构与句法之间的因果关系。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明GPT-4生成的英语与自然语言之间存在紧密联系，信息结构与句法之间的关系值得进一步探索。

Abstract: It remains debated how well any LM understands natural language or generates
reliable metalinguistic judgments. Moreover, relatively little work has
demonstrated that LMs can represent and respect subtle relationships between
form and function proposed by linguists. We here focus on a particular such
relationship established in recent work: English speakers' judgments about the
information structure of canonical sentences predicts independently collected
acceptability ratings on corresponding 'long distance dependency' [LDD]
constructions, across a wide array of base constructions and multiple types of
LDDs. To determine whether any LM captures this relationship, we probe GPT-4 on
the same tasks used with humans and new extensions.Results reveal reliable
metalinguistic skill on the information structure and acceptability tasks,
replicating a striking interaction between the two, despite the zero-shot,
explicit nature of the tasks, and little to no chance of contamination [Studies
1a, 1b]. Study 2 manipulates the information structure of base sentences and
confirms a causal relationship: increasing the prominence of a constituent in a
context sentence increases the subsequent acceptability ratings on an LDD
construction. The findings suggest a tight relationship between natural and
GPT-4 generated English, and between information structure and syntax, which
begs for further exploration.

### [5] [Atomic Consistency Preference Optimization for Long-Form Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09039)
*Jingfeng Chen,Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,Junlin Wang,Kaiwei Luo,Bhuwan Dhingra*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: ACPO是一种自监督偏好优化方法，通过利用原子一致性信号提高LLMs的事实准确性，无需外部监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs产生事实性幻觉的问题，避免依赖外部模型或知识库。

Method: 提出ACPO方法，利用多个随机响应中的原子一致性信号识别高质量数据对进行模型对齐。

Result: ACPO在LongFact和BioGen数据集上比监督基线FactAlign高出1.95分。

Conclusion: ACPO提供了一种高效且可扩展的方法，显著提升LLMs的事实可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce factoid hallucinations -
plausible yet incorrect answers. A common mitigation strategy is model
alignment, which improves factual accuracy by training on curated factual and
non-factual pairs. However, this approach often relies on a stronger model
(e.g., GPT-4) or an external knowledge base to assess factual correctness,
which may not always be accessible. To address this, we propose Atomic
Consistency Preference Optimization (ACPO), a self-supervised preference-tuning
method that enhances factual accuracy without external supervision. ACPO
leverages atomic consistency signals, i.e., the agreement of individual facts
across multiple stochastic responses, to identify high- and low-quality data
pairs for model alignment. By eliminating the need for costly GPT calls, ACPO
provides a scalable and efficient approach to improving factoid
question-answering. Despite being self-supervised, empirical results
demonstrate that ACPO outperforms FactAlign, a strong supervised alignment
baseline, by 1.95 points on the LongFact and BioGen datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in enhancing factual reliability without relying on external
models or knowledge bases.

### [6] [A Comprehensive Analysis of Large Language Model Outputs: Similarity, Diversity, and Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09056)
*Brandon Smith,Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek,Tahsin Alamgir Kheya,Phillip Dawson,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究分析了12种大型语言模型（LLM）的输出相似性、多样性和伦理表现，发现同一模型的输出相似性高，不同模型间差异显著，GPT-4表现独特且多样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在输出相似性、多样性和伦理标准方面的表现，以指导未来开发和伦理评估。

Method: 使用5,000个多样化提示生成约300万文本，涵盖12种LLM（包括开源和专有系统）。

Result: 同一LLM输出相似性高于人类文本；模型间差异显著（如WizardLM相似性高，GPT-4多样性高）；词汇和语调差异明显；部分模型表现更公平。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM行为多样性提供了新见解，有助于未来开发和伦理评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a major step toward artificial general
intelligence, significantly advancing our ability to interact with technology.
While LLMs perform well on Natural Language Processing tasks -- such as
translation, generation, code writing, and summarization -- questions remain
about their output similarity, variability, and ethical implications. For
instance, how similar are texts generated by the same model? How does this
compare across different models? And which models best uphold ethical
standards? To investigate, we used 5{,}000 prompts spanning diverse tasks like
generation, explanation, and rewriting. This resulted in approximately 3
million texts from 12 LLMs, including proprietary and open-source systems from
OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Mistral. Key findings include: (1) outputs
from the same LLM are more similar to each other than to human-written texts;
(2) models like WizardLM-2-8x22b generate highly similar outputs, while GPT-4
produces more varied responses; (3) LLM writing styles differ significantly,
with Llama 3 and Mistral showing higher similarity, and GPT-4 standing out for
distinctiveness; (4) differences in vocabulary and tone underscore the
linguistic uniqueness of LLM-generated content; (5) some LLMs demonstrate
greater gender balance and reduced bias. These results offer new insights into
the behavior and diversity of LLM outputs, helping guide future development and
ethical evaluation.

*Jennifer Haase,Paul H. P. Hanel,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: S-DAT是一种基于大语言模型和多语言嵌入的自动化框架，用于评估发散思维（DT），解决了传统创造力评估方法的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统创造力评估方法耗时、语言依赖性强且主观，限制了其扩展性和跨文化适用性。

Method: 利用大语言模型和多语言嵌入计算语义距离，作为DT的语言无关代理指标。

Result: 在11种语言中验证了S-DAT的稳健性和一致性，并展示了与其他DT测量的收敛效度和区分效度。

Conclusion: S-DAT为全球范围的创造力研究提供了更公平、更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces S-DAT (Synthetic-Divergent Association Task), a
scalable, multilingual framework for automated assessment of divergent thinking
(DT) -a core component of human creativity. Traditional creativity assessments
are often labor-intensive, language-specific, and reliant on subjective human
ratings, limiting their scalability and cross-cultural applicability. In
contrast, S-DAT leverages large language models and advanced multilingual
embeddings to compute semantic distance -- a language-agnostic proxy for DT. We
evaluate S-DAT across eleven diverse languages, including English, Spanish,
German, Russian, Hindi, and Japanese (Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana), demonstrating
robust and consistent scoring across linguistic contexts. Unlike prior DAT
approaches, the S-DAT shows convergent validity with other DT measures and
correct discriminant validity with convergent thinking. This cross-linguistic
flexibility allows for more inclusive, global-scale creativity research,
addressing key limitations of earlier approaches. S-DAT provides a powerful
tool for fairer, more comprehensive evaluation of cognitive flexibility in
diverse populations and can be freely assessed online:

### [8] [CEC-Zero: Chinese Error Correction Solution Based on LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09082)
*Sophie Zhang,Zhiming Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: CEC-Zero是一种基于强化学习的新型框架，使大型语言模型（LLM）能够通过自主学习错误策略进行自我纠正，无需外部监督。该方法显著提升了中文拼写纠正的准确性和跨领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在中文文本处理（如拼写纠正）中表现出色，但其可靠性和泛化能力仍有不足。研究旨在通过强化学习框架解决这些问题，减少对标注数据或辅助模型的依赖。

Method: 提出CEC-Zero框架，结合强化学习与LLM的生成能力，使模型能够自主学习错误纠正策略，无需外部监督或额外数据。

Result: 实验表明，RL增强的LLM在中文拼写纠正中达到行业可用准确性，并表现出卓越的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: CEC-Zero为中文NLP应用的可靠性优化提供了可扩展方案，同时为自改进语言模型建立了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
Chinese text processing capabilities, particularly in Chinese Spelling
Correction (CSC). While LLMs outperform traditional BERT-based models in
accuracy and robustness, challenges persist in reliability and generalization.
This paper proposes CEC-Zero, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework
enabling LLMs to self-correct through autonomous error strategy learning
without external supervision. By integrating RL with LLMs' generative power,
the method eliminates dependency on annotated data or auxiliary models.
Experiments reveal RL-enhanced LLMs achieve industry-viable accuracy and
superior cross-domain generalization, offering a scalable solution for
reliability optimization in Chinese NLP applications. This breakthrough
facilitates LLM deployment in practical Chinese text correction scenarios while
establishing a new paradigm for self-improving language models.

Conclusion: 展示了研究如何通过多层面工作产生有价值的成果。

Abstract: This paper describes the design, implementation and use of a new UML modeling
tool that represents a significant advance over conventional tools. Among other
things, it allows the integration of class diagrams and object diagrams as well
as the execution of objects. This not only enables new software architectures
characterized by the integration of software with corresponding object models,
but is also ideal for use in teaching, as it provides students with a
particularly stimulating learning experience. A special feature of the project
is that it has emerged from a long-standing international research project,
which is aimed at a comprehensive multi-level architecture. The project is
therefore an example of how research can lead to valuable results that arise as
a side effect of other work.

### [10] [A Scalable Unsupervised Framework for multi-aspect labeling of Multilingual and Multi-Domain Review Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09286)
*Jiin Park,Misuk Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多局限于特定领域和语言，或依赖监督学习需要大量标注数据，因此需要一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: 通过聚类提取方面类别候选，使用负采样生成方面感知嵌入向量，并评估自动生成标签的质量。

Result: 实验显示自动生成的标签质量高，模型性能优异，且框架在处理大规模数据时具有一致性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架克服了监督方法的限制，适用于多语言和多领域环境，未来将探索自动评论摘要和AI代理集成。

Abstract: Effectively analyzing online review data is essential across industries.
However, many existing studies are limited to specific domains and languages or
depend on supervised learning approaches that require large-scale labeled
datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a multilingual, scalable,
and unsupervised framework for cross-domain aspect detection. This framework is
designed for multi-aspect labeling of multilingual and multi-domain review
data. In this study, we apply automatic labeling to Korean and English review
datasets spanning various domains and assess the quality of the generated
labels through extensive experiments. Aspect category candidates are first
extracted through clustering, and each review is then represented as an
aspect-aware embedding vector using negative sampling. To evaluate the
framework, we conduct multi-aspect labeling and fine-tune several pretrained
language models to measure the effectiveness of the automatically generated
labels. Results show that these models achieve high performance, demonstrating
that the labels are suitable for training. Furthermore, comparisons with
publicly available large language models highlight the framework's superior
consistency and scalability when processing large-scale data. A human
evaluation also confirms that the quality of the automatic labels is comparable
to those created manually. This study demonstrates the potential of a robust
multi-aspect labeling approach that overcomes limitations of supervised methods
and is adaptable to multilingual, multi-domain environments. Future research
will explore automatic review summarization and the integration of artificial
intelligence agents to further improve the efficiency and depth of review
analysis.

*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: InForage是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过动态信息检索增强LLMs，解决复杂任务中的信息需求问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态检索方法无法满足复杂任务的需求，需要动态适应性的检索策略。

Method: 提出InForage框架，利用强化学习动态优化检索行为，奖励中间检索质量。

Result: 在多项任务中表现优于基线方法，展示了其高效性和适应性。

Conclusion: InForage为构建自适应、高效的推理代理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval has become a
standard method to address their inherent knowledge cutoff limitations.
However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods employ static,
pre-inference retrieval strategies, making them inadequate for complex tasks
involving ambiguous, multi-step, or evolving information needs. Recent advances
in test-time scaling techniques have demonstrated significant potential in
enabling LLMs to dynamically interact with external tools, motivating the shift
toward adaptive inference-time retrieval. Inspired by Information Foraging
Theory (IFT), we propose InForage, a reinforcement learning framework that
formalizes retrieval-augmented reasoning as a dynamic information-seeking
process. Unlike existing approaches, InForage explicitly rewards intermediate
retrieval quality, encouraging LLMs to iteratively gather and integrate
information through adaptive search behaviors. To facilitate training, we
construct a human-guided dataset capturing iterative search and reasoning
trajectories for complex, real-world web tasks. Extensive evaluations across
general question answering, multi-hop reasoning tasks, and a newly developed
real-time web QA dataset demonstrate InForage's superior performance over
baseline methods. These results highlight InForage's effectiveness in building
robust, adaptive, and efficient reasoning agents.

### [12] [Llama See, Llama Do: A Mechanistic Perspective on Contextual Entrainment and Distraction in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09338)
*Jingcheng Niu,Xingdi Yuan,Tong Wang,Hamidreza Saghir,Amir H. Abdi*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文发现了一种名为“上下文牵引”的新现象，语言模型（LMs）会显著提高输入提示中已出现过的token的概率，即使这些token无关。研究发现这一现象受语义因素影响，并通过一种新方法识别了相关注意力头（entrainment heads），关闭这些头可显著减弱该现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解语言模型如何被输入提示中的无关信息分散注意力，并探索其机制。

Method: 方法包括观察上下文牵引现象，提出假设（存在entrainment heads），并使用基于可微分掩码的新方法识别这些头。

Result: 结果显示上下文牵引是一种机制性现象，受语义因素调节；关闭entrainment heads可显著减弱该现象。

Conclusion: 结论是上下文牵引及其相关注意力头的发现为机制性分析和解决语言模型分心问题提供了关键步骤。

Abstract: We observe a novel phenomenon, contextual entrainment, across a wide range of
language models (LMs) and prompt settings, providing a new mechanistic
perspective on how LMs become distracted by ``irrelevant'' contextual
information in the input prompt. Specifically, LMs assign significantly higher
logits (or probabilities) to any tokens that have previously appeared in the
context prompt, even for random tokens. This suggests that contextual
entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, occurring independently of the
relevance or semantic relation of the tokens to the question or the rest of the
sentence. We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of
contextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual
prompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while
contextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic
factors.
  We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads -- the entrainment
heads -- that corresponds to the contextual entrainment phenomenon. Using a
novel entrainment head discovery method based on differentiable masking, we
identify these heads across various settings. When we ``turn off'' these heads,
i.e., set their outputs to zero, the effect of contextual entrainment is
significantly attenuated, causing the model to generate output that capitulates
to what it would produce if no distracting context were provided. Our discovery
of contextual entrainment, along with our investigation into LM distraction via
the entrainment heads, marks a key step towards the mechanistic analysis and
mitigation of the distraction problem.

TLDR: Qwen3是Qwen模型家族的最新版本，集成了密集和MoE架构，支持多语言，并引入了思维模式和非思维模式的统一框架，以及动态资源分配的思维预算机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升语言模型的性能、效率和多语言能力，同时减少计算资源需求，增强全球可访问性。

Method: 采用密集和MoE架构，集成思维模式和非思维模式，引入思维预算机制，并利用旗舰模型知识优化小规模模型。

Result: 在代码生成、数学推理等任务上达到SOTA，支持119种语言，计算资源需求显著降低。

Conclusion: Qwen3在性能、效率和可访问性上均有显著提升，为社区提供了开源模型。

Abstract: In this work, we present Qwen3, the latest version of the Qwen model family.
Qwen3 comprises a series of large language models (LLMs) designed to advance
performance, efficiency, and multilingual capabilities. The Qwen3 series
includes models of both dense and Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architectures, with
parameter scales ranging from 0.6 to 235 billion. A key innovation in Qwen3 is
the integration of thinking mode (for complex, multi-step reasoning) and
non-thinking mode (for rapid, context-driven responses) into a unified
framework. This eliminates the need to switch between different models--such as
chat-optimized models (e.g., GPT-4o) and dedicated reasoning models (e.g.,
QwQ-32B)--and enables dynamic mode switching based on user queries or chat
templates. Meanwhile, Qwen3 introduces a thinking budget mechanism, allowing
users to allocate computational resources adaptively during inference, thereby
balancing latency and performance based on task complexity. Moreover, by
leveraging the knowledge from the flagship models, we significantly reduce the
computational resources required to build smaller-scale models, while ensuring
their highly competitive performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
Qwen3 achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks, including
tasks in code generation, mathematical reasoning, agent tasks, etc.,
competitive against larger MoE models and proprietary models. Compared to its
predecessor Qwen2.5, Qwen3 expands multilingual support from 29 to 119
languages and dialects, enhancing global accessibility through improved
cross-lingual understanding and generation capabilities. To facilitate
reproducibility and community-driven research and development, all Qwen3 models
are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

TLDR: QEDACVC是一种基于量子计算的编码器-解码器架构，用于多语言机器翻译，替代传统的经典计算方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子计算在多语言机器翻译中的应用，以替代现有的经典计算方法。

Method: 采用量子编码器-解码器架构，结合量子卷积、量子池化、量子变分电路和量子注意力机制。

Result: 在OPUS数据集上训练后，QEDACVC在英语、法语、德语和印地语的多语言翻译中达到82%的准确率。

Conclusion: QEDACVC展示了量子计算在多语言机器翻译中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cloud-based multilingual translation services like Google Translate and
Microsoft Translator achieve state-of-the-art translation capabilities. These
services inherently use large multilingual language models such as GRU, LSTM,
BERT, GPT, T5, or similar encoder-decoder architectures with attention
mechanisms as the backbone. Also, new age natural language systems, for
instance ChatGPT and DeepSeek, have established huge potential in multiple
tasks in natural language processing. At the same time, they also possess
outstanding multilingual translation capabilities. However, these models use
the classical computing realm as a backend. QEDACVC (Quantum Encoder Decoder
Attention-based Convolutional Variational Circuits) is an alternate solution
that explores the quantum computing realm instead of the classical computing
realm to study and demonstrate multilingual machine translation. QEDACVC
introduces the quantum encoder-decoder architecture that simulates and runs on
quantum computing hardware via quantum convolution, quantum pooling, quantum

*Zongqian Li,Yixuan Su,Nigel Collier*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: PT-MoE框架结合矩阵分解和MoE路由，在参数高效微调中实现跨任务一致性和泛化能力，性能优于PT和LoRA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法存在矛盾现象，如路由器集成提升训练效率但性能不普适，矩阵分解在特定领域有效。

Method: 提出PT-MoE框架，结合矩阵分解和MoE路由，用于高效提示调优。

Result: 在17个数据集上，PT-MoE在QA和数学任务中表现最优，参数比LoRA少25%。

Conclusion: PT-MoE通过矩阵分解和MoE的互补优势实现跨任务一致性，为未来PEFT方法提供启示。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have shown promise in adapting
large language models, yet existing approaches exhibit counter-intuitive
phenomena: integrating router into prompt tuning (PT) increases training
efficiency yet does not improve performance universally; parameter reduction
through matrix decomposition can improve performance in specific domains.
Motivated by these observations and the modular nature of PT, we propose
PT-MoE, a novel framework that integrates matrix decomposition with
mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing for efficient PT. Results across 17 datasets
demonstrate that PT-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both question
answering (QA) and mathematical problem solving tasks, improving F1 score by
1.49 points over PT and 2.13 points over LoRA in QA tasks, while enhancing
mathematical accuracy by 10.75 points over PT and 0.44 points over LoRA, all
while using 25% fewer parameters than LoRA. Our analysis reveals that while PT
methods generally excel in QA tasks and LoRA-based methods in math datasets,
the integration of matrix decomposition and MoE in PT-MoE yields complementary
benefits: decomposition enables efficient parameter sharing across experts
while MoE provides dynamic adaptation, collectively enabling PT-MoE to
demonstrate cross-task consistency and generalization abilities. These
findings, along with ablation studies on routing mechanisms and architectural
components, provide insights for future PEFT methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出WorldView-Bench基准，评估大语言模型（LLMs）的全球文化包容性（GCI），通过多视角生成式评估减少西方中心主义偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs训练和评估方式强化西方中心主义，导致文化同质化，缺乏全球多样性。现有基准无法捕捉文化包容性复杂性。

Method: 基于Multiplex Worldview理论，提出两种干预策略：上下文嵌入多视角原则和多代理系统（MAS）协作生成。

Result: MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs显著提升视角分布熵（13%到94%），情感正向（67.7%）和文化平衡。

Conclusion: 多视角评估可减少LLMs文化偏见，推动更具包容性和伦理对齐的AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly trained and aligned in ways
that reinforce Western-centric epistemologies and socio-cultural norms, leading
to cultural homogenization and limiting their ability to reflect global
civilizational plurality. Existing benchmarking frameworks fail to adequately
capture this bias, as they rely on rigid, closed-form assessments that overlook
the complexity of cultural inclusivity. To address this, we introduce
WorldView-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Global Cultural Inclusivity
(GCI) in LLMs by analyzing their ability to accommodate diverse worldviews. Our
approach is grounded in the Multiplex Worldview proposed by Senturk et al.,
which distinguishes between Uniplex models, reinforcing cultural
homogenization, and Multiplex models, which integrate diverse perspectives.
WorldView-Bench measures Cultural Polarization, the exclusion of alternative
perspectives, through free-form generative evaluation rather than conventional
categorical benchmarks. We implement applied multiplexity through two
intervention strategies: (1) Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where
system prompts embed multiplexity principles, and (2) Multi-Agent System
(MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where multiple LLM agents representing
distinct cultural perspectives collaboratively generate responses. Our results
demonstrate a significant increase in Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS)
entropy from 13% at baseline to 94% with MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs,
alongside a shift toward positive sentiment (67.7%) and enhanced cultural
balance. These findings highlight the potential of multiplex-aware AI
evaluation in mitigating cultural bias in LLMs, paving the way for more
inclusive and ethically aligned AI systems.

Abstract: Driver fatigue poses a significant challenge to railway safety, with
traditional systems like the dead-man switch offering limited and basic
alertness checks. This study presents an online behavior-based monitoring
system utilizing a customised Directed-Graph Neural Network (DGNN) to classify
train driver's states into three categories: alert, not alert, and
pathological. To optimize input representations for the model, an ablation
study was performed, comparing three feature configurations: skeletal-only,
facial-only, and a combination of both. Experimental results show that
combining facial and skeletal features yields the highest accuracy (80.88%) in
the three-class model, outperforming models using only facial or skeletal
features. Furthermore, this combination achieves over 99% accuracy in the
binary alertness classification. Additionally, we introduced a novel dataset
that, for the first time, incorporates simulated pathological conditions into
train driver monitoring, broadening the scope for assessing risks related to
fatigue and health. This work represents a step forward in enhancing railway
safety through advanced online monitoring using vision-based technologies.

Abstract: Gait recognition, known for its ability to identify individuals from a
distance, has gained significant attention in recent times due to its
non-intrusive verification. While video-based gait identification systems
perform well on large public datasets, their performance drops when applied to
real-world, unconstrained gait data due to various factors. Among these,
uncontrolled outdoor environments, non-overlapping camera views, varying
illumination, and computational efficiency are core challenges in gait-based
authentication. Currently, no dataset addresses all these challenges
simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an OptiGait-LGBM model capable of
recognizing person re-identification under these constraints using a skeletal
model approach, which helps mitigate inconsistencies in a person's appearance.
The model constructs a dataset from landmark positions, minimizing memory usage
by using non-sequential data. A benchmark dataset, RUET-GAIT, is introduced to
represent uncontrolled gait sequences in complex outdoor environments. The
process involves extracting skeletal joint landmarks, generating numerical
datasets, and developing an OptiGait-LGBM gait classification model. Our aim is
to address the aforementioned challenges with minimal computational cost
compared to existing methods. A comparative analysis with ensemble techniques
such as Random Forest and CatBoost demonstrates that the proposed approach
outperforms them in terms of accuracy, memory usage, and training time. This
method provides a novel, low-cost, and memory-efficient video-based gait
recognition solution for real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 稀疏方法潜力巨大，可重新定义高精地图构建中效率与性能的权衡，挑战密集表示的传统依赖。

Abstract: Recent advancements in high-definition \emph{HD} map construction have
demonstrated the effectiveness of dense representations, which heavily rely on
computationally intensive bird's-eye view \emph{BEV} features. While sparse
representations offer a more efficient alternative by avoiding dense BEV
processing, existing methods often lag behind due to the lack of tailored
designs. These limitations have hindered the competitiveness of sparse
representations in online HD map construction. In this work, we systematically
revisit and enhance sparse representation techniques, identifying key
architectural and algorithmic improvements that bridge the gap with--and
ultimately surpass--dense approaches. We introduce a dedicated network
architecture optimized for sparse map feature extraction, a sparse-dense
segmentation auxiliary task to better leverage geometric and semantic cues, and
a denoising module guided by physical priors to refine predictions. Through
these enhancements, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
nuScenes dataset, significantly advancing HD map construction and centerline
detection. Specifically, SparseMeXt-Tiny reaches a mean average precision
\emph{mAP} of 55.5% at 32 frames per second \emph{fps}, while SparseMeXt-Base
attains 65.2% mAP. Scaling the backbone and decoder further, SparseMeXt-Large
achieves an mAP of 68.9% at over 20 fps, establishing a new benchmark for
sparse representations in HD map construction. These results underscore the
untapped potential of sparse methods, challenging the conventional reliance on
dense representations and redefining efficiency-performance trade-offs in the
field.

Conclusion: TUGS通过高效建模和参数优化，显著提升了水下3D重建的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Underwater 3D scene reconstruction is crucial for undewater robotic
perception and navigation. However, the task is significantly challenged by the
complex interplay between light propagation, water medium, and object surfaces,
with existing methods unable to model their interactions accurately.
Additionally, expensive training and rendering costs limit their practical
application in underwater robotic systems. Therefore, we propose Tensorized
Underwater Gaussian Splatting (TUGS), which can effectively solve the modeling
challenges of the complex interactions between object geometries and water
media while achieving significant parameter reduction. TUGS employs lightweight
tensorized higher-order Gaussians with a physics-based underwater Adaptive
Medium Estimation (AME) module, enabling accurate simulation of both light
attenuation and backscatter effects in underwater environments. Compared to
other NeRF-based and GS-based methods designed for underwater, TUGS is able to
render high-quality underwater images with faster rendering speeds and less
memory usage. Extensive experiments on real-world underwater datasets have
demonstrated that TUGS can efficiently achieve superior reconstruction quality
using a limited number of parameters, making it particularly suitable for
memory-constrained underwater UAV applications

Motivation: 随着DNN的广泛应用，其安全性测试成为研究重点，但目前缺乏对不同覆盖度指标的实证研究。

Method: 选择LeNet、VGG和ResNet等不同架构的DNN模型，进行实验比较不同深度、配置与覆盖度指标的关系。

Result: 分析了四种覆盖度指标（主要功能、边界、层次和结构覆盖）的关系，并探讨了数据集大小对覆盖度的影响。

Conclusion: 提出了三个未来研究方向，以进一步推动DNN模型的安全性测试。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a crucial role in the field of artificial
intelligence, and their security-related testing has been a prominent research
focus. By inputting test cases, the behavior of models is examined for
anomalies, and coverage metrics are utilized to determine the extent of neurons
covered by these test cases. With the widespread application and advancement of
DNNs, different types of neural behaviors have garnered attention, leading to
the emergence of various coverage metrics for neural networks. However, there
is currently a lack of empirical research on these coverage metrics,
specifically in analyzing the relationships and patterns between model depth,
configuration information, and neural network coverage. This paper aims to
investigate the relationships and patterns of four coverage metrics: primary
functionality, boundary, hierarchy, and structural coverage. A series of
empirical experiments were conducted, selecting LeNet, VGG, and ResNet as
different DNN architectures, along with 10 models of varying depths ranging
from 5 to 54 layers, to compare and study the relationships between different
depths, configuration information, and various neural network coverage metrics.
Additionally, an investigation was carried out on the relationships between
modified decision/condition coverage and dataset size. Finally, three potential
future directions are proposed to further contribute to the security testing of
DNN Models.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于外部多模态模型的SFW采样器，通过条件轨迹校正步骤引导生成远离不良内容，同时支持用户自定义NSFW类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于分数的生成模型（SBM）在图像合成中表现优异，但其可能生成不适宜内容（NSFW）。现有方法依赖模型自身知识且需微调，本文探索利用外部资源确保生成安全内容。

Method: 采用条件轨迹校正步骤，利用多模态模型（如CLIP）作为条件源，引导样本远离不良区域，并支持用户自定义NSFW类别。

Result: 实验证明，SFW采样器有效减少不适宜内容生成，且对图像质量影响较小，未校正样本几乎不受影响。

Conclusion: SFW采样器适用于对齐的SBM模型，展示了模型无关条件在防止不良内容生成中的潜力。

Abstract: Score-based generative models (SBM), also known as diffusion models, are the
de facto state of the art for image synthesis. Despite their unparalleled
performance, SBMs have recently been in the spotlight for being tricked into
creating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as violent images and
non-consensual nudity. Current approaches that prevent unsafe generation are
based on the models' own knowledge, and the majority of them require
fine-tuning. This article explores the use of external sources for ensuring
safe outputs in SBMs. Our safe-for-work (SFW) sampler implements a Conditional
Trajectory Correction step that guides the samples away from undesired regions
in the ambient space using multimodal models as the source of conditioning.
Furthermore, using Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP), our method
admits user-defined NSFW classes, which can vary in different settings. Our
experiments on the text-to-image SBM Stable Diffusion validate that the
proposed SFW sampler effectively reduces the generation of explicit content
while being competitive with other fine-tuning-based approaches, as assessed
via independent NSFW detectors. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of the SFW
sampler on image quality and show that the proposed correction scheme comes at
a minor cost with negligible effect on samples not needing correction. Our
study confirms the suitability of the SFW sampler towards aligned SBM models
and the potential of using model-agnostic conditioning for the prevention of
unwanted images.

Abstract: Generative AI offers new opportunities for automating urban planning by
creating site-specific urban layouts and enabling flexible design exploration.
However, existing approaches often struggle to produce realistic and practical
designs at scale. Therefore, we adapt a state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion
model, extended with ControlNet, to generate high-fidelity satellite imagery
conditioned on land use descriptions, infrastructure, and natural environments.
To overcome data availability limitations, we spatially link satellite imagery
with structured land use and constraint information from OpenStreetMap. Using
data from three major U.S. cities, we demonstrate that the proposed diffusion
model generates realistic and diverse urban landscapes by varying land-use
configurations, road networks, and water bodies, facilitating cross-city
learning and design diversity. We also systematically evaluate the impacts of
varying language prompts and control imagery on the quality of satellite
imagery generation. Our model achieves high FID and KID scores and demonstrates
robustness across diverse urban contexts. Qualitative assessments from urban
planners and the general public show that generated images align closely with
design descriptions and constraints, and are often preferred over real images.
This work establishes a benchmark for controlled urban imagery generation and
highlights the potential of generative AI as a tool for enhancing planning
workflows and public engagement.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) constitutes a transformative
technological wave that reconfigures industries through its unparalleled
capabilities for content creation, reasoning, planning, and multimodal

possibilities such as comprehensive generalization across rare cases,
evaluation and safety checks, budget-limited implementation, regulatory
compliance, ethical concerns, and environmental effects, while proposing
research plans across theoretical assurances, trust metrics, transport
integration, and socio-technical influence. By unifying these threads, the

Abstract: This study aims to improve transportation safety, especially traffic safety.
Road damage anomalies such as potholes and cracks have emerged as a significant

safety, a comprehensive system has been developed to detect potholes, cracks
(e.g. alligator, transverse, longitudinal), classify their sizes, and transmit
this data to the cloud for appropriate action by authorities. The system also
broadcasts warning signals to nearby vehicles warning them if a severe anomaly
is detected on the road. Moreover, the system can count road anomalies in
real-time. It is emulated through the utilization of Raspberry Pi, a camera
module, deep learning model, laptop, and cloud service. Deploying this
innovative solution aims to proactively enhance road safety by notifying
relevant authorities and drivers about the presence of potholes and cracks to
take actions, thereby mitigating potential accidents arising from this
prevalent road hazard leading to safer road conditions for the whole community.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和定量指标上优于相关方法。

Conclusion: CoCo去噪器为PnP方法提供了新的理论基础和实际性能提升，适用于泊松逆问题。

Abstract: Plug-and-play (PnP) methods with deep denoisers have shown impressive results
in imaging problems. They typically require strong convexity or smoothness of
the fidelity term and a (residual) non-expansive denoiser for convergence.
These assumptions, however, are violated in Poisson inverse problems, and
non-expansiveness can hinder denoising performance. To address these
challenges, we propose a cocoercive conservative (CoCo) denoiser, which may be
(residual) expansive, leading to improved denoising. By leveraging the
generalized Helmholtz decomposition, we introduce a novel training strategy
that combines Hamiltonian regularization to promote conservativeness and
spectral regularization to ensure cocoerciveness. We prove that CoCo denoiser
is a proximal operator of a weakly convex function, enabling a restoration
model with an implicit weakly convex prior. The global convergence of PnP
methods to a stationary point of this restoration model is established.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
closely related methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为DCS-Attention的新型注意力模块，通过可微分通道选择提升注意力权重计算，显著提高了行人重识别任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于信息瓶颈（IB）原则，旨在选择最具信息量的通道以提取关键特征。

Method: 设计了DCS-Attention模块，支持固定或可学习骨干网络（DCS-FB和DCS-DNAS），并推导了IB损失的变分上界。

Result: 在多个行人重识别基准测试中，DCS-Attention显著提升了深度神经网络的预测准确性。

Conclusion: DCS-Attention通过学习关键判别特征，证明了其在行人重识别任务中的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel attention module termed the Differentiable
Channel Selection Attention module, or the DCS-Attention module. In contrast
with conventional self-attention, the DCS-Attention module features selection
of informative channels in the computation of the attention weights. The
selection of the feature channels is performed in a differentiable manner,
enabling seamless integration with DNN training. Our DCS-Attention is
compatible with either fixed neural network backbones or learnable backbones
with Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS), leading to DCS with
Fixed Backbone (DCS-FB) and DCS-DNAS, respectively. Importantly, our
DCS-Attention is motivated by the principle of Information Bottleneck (IB), and
a novel variational upper bound for the IB loss, which can be optimized by SGD,
is derived and incorporated into the training loss of the networks with the
DCS-Attention modules. In this manner, a neural network with DCS-Attention
modules is capable of selecting the most informative channels for feature
extraction so that it enjoys state-of-the-art performance for the Re-ID task.
Extensive experiments on multiple person Re-ID benchmarks using both DCS-FB and
DCS-DNAS show that DCS-Attention significantly enhances the prediction accuracy
of DNNs for person Re-ID, which demonstrates the effectiveness of DCS-Attention
in learning discriminative features critical to identifying person identities.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: PRIOR通过差异加权NTP损失，优先处理图像相关标记，减少噪声拟合和幻觉风险，显著提升视觉语言模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LVLMs预训练中，NTP方法因仅部分标记与视觉内容相关，易拟合噪声并增加幻觉风险。

Method: PRIOR利用文本参考LLM为标记分配权重，调整NTP损失，优先训练图像相关标记。

Result: 在两种LVLMs设置下，PRIOR分别带来19%和8%的相对改进，并展示更好的扩展性。

Conclusion: PRIOR通过差异加权策略有效提升视觉语言模型的性能和扩展潜力。

Abstract: In standard large vision-language models (LVLMs) pre-training, the model
typically maximizes the joint probability of the caption conditioned on the
image via next-token prediction (NTP); however, since only a small subset of
caption tokens directly relates to the visual content, this naive NTP
unintentionally fits the model to noise and increases the risk of
hallucination. We present PRIOR, a simple vision-language pre-training approach
that addresses this issue by prioritizing image-related tokens through
differential weighting in the NTP loss, drawing from the importance sampling
framework. PRIOR introduces a reference model-a text-only large language model
(LLM) trained on the captions without image inputs, to weight each token based
on its probability for LVLMs training. Intuitively, tokens that are directly
related to the visual inputs are harder to predict without the image and thus
receive lower probabilities from the text-only reference LLM. During training,
we implement a token-specific re-weighting term based on the importance scores
to adjust each token's loss. We implement PRIOR in two distinct settings: LVLMs
with visual encoders and LVLMs without visual encoders. We observe 19% and 8%
average relative improvement, respectively, on several vision-language
benchmarks compared to NTP. In addition, PRIOR exhibits superior scaling
properties, as demonstrated by significantly higher scaling coefficients,
indicating greater potential for performance gains compared to NTP given
increasing compute and data.

Result: 在OTB2015、LaSOT和GOT-10k等数据集上，AMGA显著提升了攻击性能、迁移性和欺骗性。

Conclusion: AMGA通过缩小白盒和黑盒攻击的差距，在视觉跟踪领域实现了卓越的攻击效果。

Abstract: In recent years, visual tracking methods based on convolutional neural
networks and Transformers have achieved remarkable performance and have been
successfully applied in fields such as autonomous driving. However, the
numerous security issues exposed by deep learning models have gradually
affected the reliable application of visual tracking methods in real-world
scenarios. Therefore, how to reveal the security vulnerabilities of existing
visual trackers through effective adversarial attacks has become a critical
problem that needs to be addressed. To this end, we propose an adaptive
meta-gradient adversarial attack (AMGA) method for visual tracking. This method
integrates multi-model ensembles and meta-learning strategies, combining
momentum mechanisms and Gaussian smoothing, which can significantly enhance the
transferability and attack effectiveness of adversarial examples. AMGA randomly
selects models from a large model repository, constructs diverse tracking
scenarios, and iteratively performs both white- and black-box adversarial
attacks in each scenario, optimizing the gradient directions of each model.
This paradigm minimizes the gap between white- and black-box adversarial
attacks, thus achieving excellent attack performance in black-box scenarios.
Extensive experimental results on large-scale datasets such as OTB2015, LaSOT,
and GOT-10k demonstrate that AMGA significantly improves the attack
performance, transferability, and deception of adversarial examples. Codes and
data are available at https://github.com/pgao-lab/AMGA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计热量摄入对2型糖尿病管理至关重要，但现有方法（如CGM）因个体和餐食差异难以全面捕捉营养信息。

Method: 采用注意力编码和卷积特征提取处理食物图像，多层感知器处理CGM和微生物组数据，并通过后期融合策略联合推理。

Result: 在40多名参与者的数据集上，模型RMSRE为0.2544，优于基线模型50%以上。

Conclusion: 多模态传感技术有望提升慢性病管理的自动化饮食评估工具。

Abstract: Effective dietary monitoring is critical for managing Type 2 diabetes, yet
accurately estimating caloric intake remains a major challenge. While
continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) offer valuable physiological data, they
often fall short in capturing the full nutritional profile of meals due to
inter-individual and meal-specific variability. In this work, we introduce a
multimodal deep learning framework that jointly leverages CGM time-series data,
Demographic/Microbiome, and pre-meal food images to enhance caloric estimation.
Our model utilizes attention based encoding and a convolutional feature
extraction for meal imagery, multi-layer perceptrons for CGM and Microbiome
data followed by a late fusion strategy for joint reasoning. We evaluate our
approach on a curated dataset of over 40 participants, incorporating
synchronized CGM, Demographic and Microbiome data and meal photographs with
standardized caloric labels. Our model achieves a Root Mean Squared Relative
Error (RMSRE) of 0.2544, outperforming the baselines models by over 50%. These
findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal sensing to improve automated
dietary assessment tools for chronic disease management.

invariance by using (1) a shared (joint) attention mapping to emphasize common

and (2) a joint entropy regularizing loss to promote better
consistency$\unicode{x2014}$enhancing correlations among the intersecting 2D

complex road geometries, degraded lane markings, adverse weather, lighting
conditions and surrounding traffic. The dataset is multimodal, comprising: i)
full CAN bus streams, decoded using custom reverse-engineered DBC files to
extract key LKA events (e.g., system disengagements, lane detection failures);
ii) synchronized high-resolution dash-cam video; iii) real-time outputs from
Openpilot, providing accurate estimates of road curvature and lane positioning;

Motivation: 传统场景图主要关注空间关系，限制了VLMs对复杂交互的推理能力。现有方法存在关系集不相关和缺乏持久记忆的问题。

Method: ISGR框架包括双流图构造器（结合空间关系提取和交互感知标注）、交互查询激活VLMs功能知识、长期记忆强化学习策略。

Result: 实验表明，ISGR在交互密集型推理基准上显著优于基线方法，尤其在复杂场景理解任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: ISGR通过增强交互推理能力，为VLMs在复杂场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional scene graphs primarily focus on spatial relationships, limiting
vision-language models' (VLMs) ability to reason about complex interactions in
visual scenes. This paper addresses two key challenges: (1) conventional
detection-to-construction methods produce unfocused, contextually irrelevant
relationship sets, and (2) existing approaches fail to form persistent memories
for generalizing interaction reasoning to new scenes. We propose
Interaction-augmented Scene Graph Reasoning (ISGR), a framework that enhances
VLMs' interactional reasoning through three complementary components. First,
our dual-stream graph constructor combines SAM-powered spatial relation
extraction with interaction-aware captioning to generate functionally salient
scene graphs with spatial grounding. Second, we employ targeted interaction
queries to activate VLMs' latent knowledge of object functionalities,
converting passive recognition into active reasoning about how objects work
together. Finally, we introduce a lone-term memory reinforcement learning
strategy with a specialized interaction-focused reward function that transforms
transient patterns into long-term reasoning heuristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods on
interaction-heavy reasoning benchmarks, with particularly strong improvements
on complex scene understanding tasks. The source code can be accessed at

Motivation: 尽管之前的研究认为SAM不适用于COD，但本研究证明通过适当的提示，SAM可以胜任这一任务，从而避免了从头设计专业模型的复杂性和资源消耗。

Method: 研究设计了Promotion Point Targeting Network（PPT-net）预测伪装目标的存在概率，并开发了关键点选择（KPS）算法，通过正负点提示对比引导SAM进行分割。

Result: 在3个数据集和6个指标下，该方法实验表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了利用SAM进行COD的现成方法，不仅在性能上有优势，还将问题简化为寻找信息性而非精确的提示。

Abstract: Big model has emerged as a new research paradigm that can be applied to
various down-stream tasks with only minor effort for domain adaption.
Correspondingly, this study tackles Camouflaged Object Detection (COD)
leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The previous studies declared that
SAM is not workable for COD but this study reveals that SAM works if promoted
properly, for which we devise a new framework to render point promotions:
First, we develop the Promotion Point Targeting Network (PPT-net) to leverage
multi-scale features in predicting the probabilities of camouflaged objects'
presences at given candidate points over the image. Then, we develop a key
point selection (KPS) algorithm to deploy both positive and negative point
promotions contrastively to SAM to guide the segmentation. It is the first work
to facilitate big model for COD and achieves plausible results experimentally
over the existing methods on 3 data sets under 6 metrics. This study
demonstrates an off-the-shelf methodology for COD by leveraging SAM, which
gains advantage over designing professional models from scratch, not only in
performance, but also in turning the problem to a less challenging task, that
is, seeking informative but not exactly precise promotions.

Abstract: The deployment of traditional deep learning models in high-risk security
tasks in an unlabeled, data-non-exploitable video intelligence environment
faces significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a lightweight anomaly
detection framework based on color features for surveillance video clips in a
high sensitivity tactical mission, aiming to quickly identify and interpret
potential threat events under resource-constrained and data-sensitive
conditions. The method fuses unsupervised KMeans clustering with RGB channel
histogram modeling to achieve composite detection of structural anomalies and
color mutation signals in key frames. The experiment takes an operation
surveillance video occurring in an African country as a research sample, and
successfully identifies multiple highly anomalous frames related to high-energy
light sources, target presence, and reflective interference under the condition
of no access to the original data. The results show that this method can be
effectively used for tactical assassination warning, suspicious object
screening and environmental drastic change monitoring with strong deployability
and tactical interpretation value. The study emphasizes the importance of color
features as low semantic battlefield signal carriers, and its battlefield
intelligent perception capability will be further extended by combining graph
neural networks and temporal modeling in the future.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) offer flexible object detection through natural

phrasing. In this paper, we introduce a method for automated prompt refinement
using a novel metric called the Contrastive Class Alignment Score (CCAS), which
ranks prompts based on their semantic alignment with a target object class
while penalizing similarity to confounding classes. Our method generates
diverse prompt candidates via a large language model and filters them through
CCAS, computed using prompt embeddings from a sentence transformer. We evaluate
our approach on challenging object categories, demonstrating that our automatic
selection of high-precision prompts improves object detection accuracy without
the need for additional model training or labeled data. This scalable and
model-agnostic pipeline offers a principled alternative to manual prompt
engineering for VLM-based detection systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models have significantly
improved 3D point cloud generation. However, existing methods primarily focus
on local feature extraction while overlooking global topological information,
such as voids, which are crucial for maintaining shape consistency and
capturing complex geometries. To address this limitation, we propose
TopoDiT-3D, a Topology-Aware Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck structure
for 3D point cloud generation. Specifically, we design the bottleneck structure
utilizing Perceiver Resampler, which not only offers a mode to integrate
topological information extracted through persistent homology into feature

training efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TopoDiT-3D
outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual quality, diversity, and training
efficiency. Furthermore, TopoDiT-3D demonstrates the importance of rich

Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）因缺乏高质量的原理图-网表训练数据，难以理解电路原理图。现有方法如AMSnet依赖硬编码启发式，难以处理复杂或噪声原理图。

Conclusion: 新方法提高了对复杂原理图的理解能力，扩展的数据集为未来研究提供了更丰富的资源。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to understand
circuit schematics due to their limited recognition capabilities. This could be
attributed to the lack of high-quality schematic-netlist training data.
Existing work such as AMSnet applies schematic parsing to generate netlists.
However, these methods rely on hard-coded heuristics and are difficult to apply
to complex or noisy schematics in this paper. We therefore propose a novel net
detection mechanism based on segmentation with high robustness. The proposed
method also recovers positional information, allowing digital reconstruction of
schematics. We then expand AMSnet dataset with schematic images from various
sources and create AMSnet 2.0. AMSnet 2.0 contains 2,686 circuits with
schematic images, Spectre-formatted netlists, OpenAccess digital schematics,
and positional information for circuit components and nets, whereas AMSnet only
includes 792 circuits with SPICE netlists but no digital schematics.

Result: 实验表明，DRRNet在基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DRRNet通过多阶段特征融合与逆向细化，有效解决了伪装目标检测中的挑战。

Abstract: The core challenge in Camouflage Object Detection (COD) lies in the
indistinguishable similarity between targets and backgrounds in terms of color,
texture, and shape. This causes existing methods to either lose edge details
(such as hair-like fine structures) due to over-reliance on global semantic
information or be disturbed by similar backgrounds (such as vegetation
patterns) when relying solely on local features. We propose DRRNet, a
four-stage architecture characterized by a "context-detail-fusion-refinement"
pipeline to address these issues. Specifically, we introduce an Omni-Context
Feature Extraction Module to capture global camouflage patterns and a Local
Detail Extraction Module to supplement microstructural information for the
full-scene context module. We then design a module for forming dual
representations of scene understanding and structural awareness, which fuses
panoramic features and local features across various scales. In the decoder, we
also introduce a reverse refinement module that leverages spatial edge priors
and frequency-domain noise suppression to perform a two-stage inverse
refinement of the output. By applying two successive rounds of inverse
refinement, the model effectively suppresses background interference and
enhances the continuity of object boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate
that DRRNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark
datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/jerrySunning/DRRNet.

Conclusion: UniCAD为医学影像研究提供了高效、可扩展的开源平台，促进公平研究生态。

Abstract: The growing complexity and scale of visual model pre-training have made
developing and deploying multi-task computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems
increasingly challenging and resource-intensive. Furthermore, the medical
imaging community lacks an open-source CAD platform to enable the rapid
creation of efficient and extendable diagnostic models. To address these
issues, we propose UniCAD, a unified architecture that leverages the robust
capabilities of pre-trained vision foundation models to seamlessly handle both
2D and 3D medical images while requiring only minimal task-specific parameters.
UniCAD introduces two key innovations: (1) Efficiency: A low-rank adaptation
strategy is employed to adapt a pre-trained visual model to the medical image
domain, achieving performance on par with fully fine-tuned counterparts while
introducing only 0.17% trainable parameters. (2) Plug-and-Play: A modular
architecture that combines a frozen foundation model with multiple
plug-and-play experts, enabling diverse tasks and seamless functionality
expansion. Building on this unified CAD architecture, we establish an
open-source platform where researchers can share and access lightweight CAD

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量化方法依赖训练数据，但在隐私或安全限制下不适用，ZSQ无需真实数据即可实现量化。

Method: 对现有ZSQ方法按数据生成策略分类，分析其动机、核心思想和关键点。

Result: 提供了ZSQ的首次深入综述，总结了各类方法的优缺点。

Conclusion: ZSQ是资源受限设备上部署深度学习模型的有效方法，未来需进一步解决其局限性。

Abstract: Network quantization has proven to be a powerful approach to reduce the
memory and computational demands of deep learning models for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. However, traditional quantization methods often
rely on access to training data, which is impractical in many real-world
scenarios due to privacy, security, or regulatory constraints. Zero-shot
Quantization (ZSQ) emerges as a promising solution, achieving quantization
without requiring any real data. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive
overview of ZSQ methods and their recent advancements. First, we provide a
formal definition of the ZSQ problem and highlight the key challenges. Then, we
categorize the existing ZSQ methods into classes based on data generation
strategies, and analyze their motivations, core ideas, and key takeaways.
Lastly, we suggest future research directions to address the remaining
limitations and advance the field of ZSQ. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper is the first in-depth survey on ZSQ.

*Tong Li,Lizhi Wang,Hansen Feng,Lin Zhu,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种称为参数动态演化（PDE）的方法，用于解决低光图像增强中的“基因效应”问题，即随机参数有时优于学习参数的现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现，低光图像增强中，某些参数重置为随机值反而能提升性能，这种现象被称为“基因效应”，限制了模型的性能。

Method: 受生物进化启发，提出参数动态演化（PDE），通过参数正交生成技术模拟基因重组和突变，动态适应不同图像。

Result: 实验验证了PDE方法的有效性，能够缓解基因效应并提升图像增强性能。

Conclusion: PDE为低光图像增强提供了一种新思路，代码将公开。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental task in computational
photography, aiming to improve illumination, reduce noise, and enhance image
quality. While recent advancements focus on designing increasingly complex
neural network models, we observe a peculiar phenomenon: resetting certain
parameters to random values unexpectedly improves enhancement performance for
some images. Drawing inspiration from biological genes, we term this phenomenon
the gene effect. The gene effect limits enhancement performance, as even random
parameters can sometimes outperform learned ones, preventing models from fully
utilizing their capacity. In this paper, we investigate the reason and propose
a solution. Based on our observations, we attribute the gene effect to static
parameters, analogous to how fixed genetic configurations become maladaptive
when environments change. Inspired by biological evolution, where adaptation to
new environments relies on gene mutation and recombination, we propose
parameter dynamic evolution (PDE) to adapt to different images and mitigate the
gene effect. PDE employs a parameter orthogonal generation technique and the
corresponding generated parameters to simulate gene recombination and gene
mutation, separately. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our techniques.
The code will be released to the public.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的替代模型，用于快速预测多层超表面雷达吸收结构（RAS）的电磁响应，显著减少了计算时间和设计空间探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖全波仿真工具进行电磁设计和优化，计算量大且耗时，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用基于CNN的架构和Huber损失函数，预测RAS的反射特性。

Result: 模型在1000次训练周期内达到99.9%的余弦相似度和0.001的均方误差，计算时间大幅减少且预测精度高。

Conclusion: 该替代模型在保持高精度的同时显著提升了设计效率，适用于超表面RAS的快速优化。

Abstract: Metasurface-based radar absorbing structures (RAS) are highly preferred for
applications like stealth technology, electromagnetic (EM) shielding, etc. due
to their capability to achieve frequency selective absorption characteristics
with minimal thickness and reduced weight penalty. However, the conventional
approach for the EM design and optimization of these structures relies on
forward simulations, using full wave simulation tools, to predict the
electromagnetic (EM) response of candidate meta atoms. This process is
computationally intensive, extremely time consuming and requires exploration of
large design spaces. To overcome this challenge, we propose a surrogate model
that significantly accelerates the prediction of EM responses of multi-layered
metasurface-based RAS. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture
with Huber loss function has been employed to estimate the reflection
characteristics of the RAS model. The proposed model achieved a cosine
similarity of 99.9% and a mean square error of 0.001 within 1000 epochs of
training. The efficiency of the model has been established via full wave
simulations as well as experiment where it demonstrated significant reduction
in computational time while maintaining high predictive accuracy.

TLDR: 研究比较了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）与传统深度学习方法在颅内出血（ICH）分类和分型中的表现，发现传统方法在准确率上更优，但MLLMs在交互性和可解释性上有潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 及时识别颅内出血亚型对预后和治疗决策至关重要，但由于图像对比度低和边界模糊，传统方法存在挑战。

Method: 使用RSNA提供的192例NCCT数据，比较了GPT-4o、Gemini 2.0 Flash等MLLMs与ResNet50、Vision Transformer等传统模型在ICH分类任务中的表现。

Result: 传统模型在ICH二元分类和亚型分类中均优于MLLMs，例如Gemini 2.0 Flash的宏平均F1分数仅为0.31。

Conclusion: MLLMs在交互性上有优势，但准确率不及传统模型。未来需优化模型以提高其在三维医学图像处理中的表现。

Abstract: Introduction: Timely identification of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) subtypes
on non-contrast computed tomography is critical for prognosis prediction and
therapeutic decision-making, yet remains challenging due to low contrast and
blurring boundaries. This study evaluates the performance of zero-shot
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) compared to traditional deep learning
methods in ICH binary classification and subtyping. Methods: We utilized a
dataset provided by RSNA, comprising 192 NCCT volumes. The study compares
various MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2,
with conventional deep learning models, including ResNet50 and Vision
Transformer. Carefully crafted prompts were used to guide MLLMs in tasks such
as ICH presence, subtype classification, localization, and volume estimation.
Results: The results indicate that in the ICH binary classification task,
traditional deep learning models outperform MLLMs comprehensively. For subtype
classification, MLLMs also exhibit inferior performance compared to traditional
deep learning models, with Gemini 2.0 Flash achieving an macro-averaged
precision of 0.41 and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.31. Conclusion: While
MLLMs excel in interactive capabilities, their overall accuracy in ICH
subtyping is inferior to deep networks. However, MLLMs enhance interpretability
through language interactions, indicating potential in medical imaging
analysis. Future efforts will focus on model refinement and developing more
precise MLLMs to improve performance in three-dimensional medical image
processing.

TLDR: 提出Pose-TTA方法，通过测试阶段增强头部姿态提升人脸识别性能，无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需针对每个数据集重新训练，耗时耗力。Pose-TTA旨在测试阶段对齐人脸姿态，避免重新训练。

Method: 使用肖像动画器将源图像身份转移到驱动图像姿态，生成匹配的侧脸图像以减少信息损失，并提出加权特征聚合策略。

Result: 实验表明Pose-TTA能持续提升推理性能，且易于集成到现有流程中。

Conclusion: Pose-TTA是一种高效、无需重新训练的人脸识别增强方法。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to enhance face recognition performance by
augmenting head poses during the testing phase. Existing methods often rely on
training on frontalised images or learning pose-invariant representations, yet
both approaches typically require re-training and testing for each dataset,
involving a substantial amount of effort. In contrast, this study proposes
Pose-TTA, a novel approach that aligns faces at inference time without
additional training. To achieve this, we employ a portrait animator that
transfers the source image identity into the pose of a driving image. Instead
of frontalising a side-profile face -- which can introduce distortion --
Pose-TTA generates matching side-profile images for comparison, thereby
reducing identity information loss. Furthermore, we propose a weighted feature
aggregation strategy to address any distortions or biases arising from the
synthetic data, thus enhancing the reliability of the augmented images.
Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and with various pre-trained face
recognition models demonstrate that Pose-TTA consistently improves inference
performance. Moreover, our method is straightforward to integrate into existing
face recognition pipelines, as it requires no retraining or fine-tuning of the
underlying recognition models.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为AnoGen的少样本异常生成方法，通过扩散模型生成真实且多样的异常，以提升工业检测中异常检测模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业检测中异常样本稀缺，现有方法生成的异常与真实异常存在语义差距，导致检测性能不佳。

Method: 分三阶段：1) 学习异常分布并嵌入知识；2) 用嵌入和边界框指导扩散模型生成异常；3) 提出弱监督异常检测方法训练模型。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上，DRAEM和DesTSeg的AU-PR指标分别提升了5.8%和1.5%。

Conclusion: AnoGen生成的异常有效提升了异常分类和分割任务的性能。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a practical and challenging task due to the scarcity of
anomaly samples in industrial inspection. Some existing anomaly detection
methods address this issue by synthesizing anomalies with noise or external
data. However, there is always a large semantic gap between synthetic and
real-world anomalies, resulting in weak performance in anomaly detection. To
solve the problem, we propose a few-shot Anomaly-driven Generation (AnoGen)
method, which guides the diffusion model to generate realistic and diverse
anomalies with only a few real anomalies, thereby benefiting training anomaly
detection models. Specifically, our work is divided into three stages. In the
first stage, we learn the anomaly distribution based on a few given real
anomalies and inject the learned knowledge into an embedding. In the second
stage, we use the embedding and given bounding boxes to guide the diffusion
model to generate realistic and diverse anomalies on specific objects (or
textures). In the final stage, we propose a weakly-supervised anomaly detection
method to train a more powerful model with generated anomalies. Our method
builds upon DRAEM and DesTSeg as the foundation model and conducts experiments
on the commonly used industrial anomaly detection dataset, MVTec. The
experiments demonstrate that our generated anomalies effectively improve the
model performance of both anomaly classification and segmentation tasks
simultaneously, \eg, DRAEM and DseTSeg achieved a 5.8\% and 1.5\% improvement
in AU-PR metric on segmentation task, respectively. The code and generated
anomalous data are available at https://github.com/gaobb/AnoGen.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于自注意力变换器的无监督重构网络在多类异常检测中表现优异，但可能因目标特征的高一致性导致对异常特征的重构失败，且低分辨率潜在空间的重构导致异常分割不准确。

Method: 提出OneNIP方法，仅需一张正常图像提示即可重构或恢复异常特征；并引入监督细化器，利用真实正常和合成异常图像回归重构误差，提升像素级异常分割。

Result: 在MVTec、BTAD和VisA三个工业异常检测基准上优于先前方法。

Conclusion: OneNIP方法高效且泛化能力强，显著提升了统一异常检测性能，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised reconstruction networks using self-attention transformers have
achieved state-of-the-art performance for multi-class (unified) anomaly
detection with a single model. However, these self-attention reconstruction
models primarily operate on target features, which may result in perfect
reconstruction for both normal and anomaly features due to high consistency
with context, leading to failure in detecting anomalies. Additionally, these
models often produce inaccurate anomaly segmentation due to performing
reconstruction in a low spatial resolution latent space. To enable
reconstruction models enjoying high efficiency while enhancing their
generalization for unified anomaly detection, we propose a simple yet effective
method that reconstructs normal features and restores anomaly features with
just One Normal Image Prompt (OneNIP). In contrast to previous work, OneNIP
allows for the first time to reconstruct or restore anomalies with just one
normal image prompt, effectively boosting unified anomaly detection
performance. Furthermore, we propose a supervised refiner that regresses
reconstruction errors by using both real normal and synthesized anomalous
images, which significantly improves pixel-level anomaly segmentation. OneNIP
outperforms previous methods on three industry anomaly detection benchmarks:
MVTec, BTAD, and VisA. The code and pre-trained models are available at

Result: MetaUAS在零样本、少样本和全样本异常分割任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MetaUAS是首个不依赖语言模型和特定数据集的通用异常分割方法，仅需一张正常图像提示即可高效分割任何异常。

Abstract: Zero- and few-shot visual anomaly segmentation relies on powerful
vision-language models that detect unseen anomalies using manually designed
textual prompts. However, visual representations are inherently independent of
language. In this paper, we explore the potential of a pure visual foundation
model as an alternative to widely used vision-language models for universal
visual anomaly segmentation. We present a novel paradigm that unifies anomaly
segmentation into change segmentation. This paradigm enables us to leverage
large-scale synthetic image pairs, featuring object-level and local region
changes, derived from existing image datasets, which are independent of target
anomaly datasets. We propose a one-prompt Meta-learning framework for Universal
Anomaly Segmentation (MetaUAS) that is trained on this synthetic dataset and
then generalizes well to segment any novel or unseen visual anomalies in the
real world. To handle geometrical variations between prompt and query images,
we propose a soft feature alignment module that bridges paired-image change
perception and single-image semantic segmentation. This is the first work to
achieve universal anomaly segmentation using a pure vision model without
relying on special anomaly detection datasets and pre-trained visual-language
models. Our method effectively and efficiently segments any anomalies with only
one normal image prompt and enjoys training-free without guidance from
language. Our MetaUAS significantly outperforms previous zero-shot, few-shot,
and even full-shot anomaly segmentation methods. The code and pre-trained
models are available at https://github.com/gaobb/MetaUAS.

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable biodiversity monitoring methods has fuelled
interest in remote sensing data, due to its widespread availability and
extensive coverage. Traditionally, the application of remote sensing to
biodiversity research has focused on mapping and monitoring habitats, but with
increasing availability of large-scale citizen-science wildlife observation
data, recent methods have started to explore predicting multi-species presence
directly from satellite images. This paper presents a new data set for
predicting butterfly species presence from satellite data in the United
Kingdom. We experimentally optimise a Resnet-based model to predict
multi-species presence from 4-band satellite images, and find that this model
especially outperforms the mean rate baseline for locations with high species
biodiversity. To improve performance, we develop a soft, supervised contrastive
regularisation loss that is tailored to probabilistic labels (such as
species-presence data), and demonstrate that this improves prediction accuracy.
In summary, our new data set and contrastive regularisation method contribute
to the open challenge of accurately predicting species biodiversity from remote
sensing data, which is key for efficient biodiversity monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频编解码标准（如AVC、HEVC等）依赖手工特征，而神经视频编解码（NVC）通过学习内容感知压缩策略，提供了更高的压缩效率和适应性。然而，其高计算需求限制了在实时应用（如视频会议）中的使用。

Conclusion: 该研究为神经视频编解码领域提供了首个基于高斯泼溅的实时视频压缩方案，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: The computer vision and image processing research community has been involved
in standardizing video data communications for the past many decades, leading
to standards such as AVC, HEVC, VVC, AV1, AV2, etc. However, recent
groundbreaking works have focused on employing deep learning-based techniques
to replace the traditional video codec pipeline to a greater affect. Neural
video codecs (NVC) create an end-to-end ML-based solution that does not rely on
any handcrafted features (motion or edge-based) and have the ability to learn
content-aware compression strategies, offering better adaptability and higher
compression efficiency than traditional methods. This holds a great potential
not only for hardware design, but also for various video streaming platforms
and applications, especially video conferencing applications such as MS-Teams
or Zoom that have found extensive usage in classrooms and workplaces. However,
their high computational demands currently limit their use in real-time
applications like video conferencing. To address this, we propose a
region-of-interest (ROI) based neural video compression model that leverages 2D
Gaussian Splatting. Unlike traditional codecs, 2D Gaussian Splatting is capable
of real-time decoding and can be optimized using fewer data points, requiring
only thousands of Gaussians for decent quality outputs as opposed to millions
in 3D scenes. In this work, we designed a video pipeline that speeds up the
encoding time of the previous Gaussian splatting-based image codec by 88% by
using a content-aware initialization strategy paired with a novel Gaussian
inter-frame redundancy-reduction mechanism, enabling Gaussian splatting to be
used for a video-codec solution, the first of its kind solution in this neural
video codec space.

Abstract: Scaling up model and data size have demonstrated impressive performance
improvement over a wide range of tasks. Despite extensive studies on scaling
behaviors for general-purpose tasks, medical images exhibit substantial
differences from natural data. It remains unclear the key factors in developing
medical vision foundation models at scale due to the absence of an extensive
understanding of scaling behavior in the medical domain. In this paper, we
explored the scaling behavior across model sizes, training algorithms, data
sizes, and imaging modalities in developing scalable medical vision foundation
models by self-supervised learning. To support scalable pretraining, we
introduce BioVFM-21M, a large-scale biomedical image dataset encompassing a
wide range of biomedical image modalities and anatomies. We observed that
scaling up does provide benefits but varies across tasks. Additional analysis
reveals several factors correlated with scaling benefits. Finally, we propose
BioVFM, a large-scale medical vision foundation model pretrained on 21 million
biomedical images, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation
models across 12 medical benchmarks. Our results highlight that while scaling
up is beneficial for pursuing better performance, task characteristics, data
diversity, pretraining methods, and computational efficiency remain critical
considerations for developing scalable medical foundation models.

through a novel multiview contrastive learning strategy that leverages stable
positive-negative pair sampling. A gradient-friendly loss function is
introduced to promote smoother and more stable convergence, and the model is
optimized for distributed training to ensure scalability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MultiviewVLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and
can be easily adapted to various real-world applications with minimal

Abstract: The success of deep learning in computer vision over the past decade has
hinged on large labeled datasets and strong pretrained models. In data-scarce
settings, the quality of these pretrained models becomes crucial for effective
transfer learning. Image classification and self-supervised learning have
traditionally been the primary methods for pretraining CNNs and
transformer-based architectures. Recently, the rise of text-to-image generative
models, particularly those using denoising diffusion in a latent space, has
introduced a new class of foundational models trained on massive, captioned
image datasets. These models' ability to generate realistic images of unseen
content suggests they possess a deep understanding of the visual world. In this
work, we present Marigold, a family of conditional generative models and a
fine-tuning protocol that extracts the knowledge from pretrained latent
diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and adapts them for dense image analysis
tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normals prediction, and
intrinsic decomposition. Marigold requires minimal modification of the
pre-trained latent diffusion model's architecture, trains with small synthetic
datasets on a single GPU over a few days, and demonstrates state-of-the-art
zero-shot generalization. Project page:

Conclusion: RobustSpring将鲁棒性作为首要目标，旨在推动兼具准确性和鲁棒性的模型发展。

Abstract: Standard benchmarks for optical flow, scene flow, and stereo vision
algorithms generally focus on model accuracy rather than robustness to image
corruptions like noise or rain. Hence, the resilience of models to such
real-world perturbations is largely unquantified. To address this, we present
RobustSpring, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for evaluating robustness
to image corruptions for optical flow, scene flow, and stereo models.
RobustSpring applies 20 different image corruptions, including noise, blur,
color changes, quality degradations, and weather distortions, in a time-,
stereo-, and depth-consistent manner to the high-resolution Spring dataset,
creating a suite of 20,000 corrupted images that reflect challenging
conditions. RobustSpring enables comparisons of model robustness via a new
corruption robustness metric. Integration with the Spring benchmark enables
public two-axis evaluations of both accuracy and robustness. We benchmark a
curated selection of initial models, observing that accurate models are not
necessarily robust and that robustness varies widely by corruption type.
RobustSpring is a new computer vision benchmark that treats robustness as a
first-class citizen to foster models that combine accuracy with resilience. It
will be available at https://spring-benchmark.org.

TLDR: MAKE是一种多知识增强的视觉语言预训练框架，用于零样本皮肤病任务，通过分解临床叙述、细粒度对齐和诊断引导加权，显著优于现有VLP模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病诊断需要结合视觉特征和临床知识，但现有视觉语言预训练（VLP）因文本长度限制和非结构化文本而效果受限。

Method: MAKE框架包括多对比学习策略、细粒度对齐机制和诊断引导加权方案。

Result: 在403,563个皮肤病图像-文本对上预训练后，MAKE在8个数据集上的零样本任务中显著优于现有VLP模型。

Conclusion: MAKE通过多知识增强和细粒度对齐，提升了皮肤病AI诊断的零样本性能。

Abstract: Dermatological diagnosis represents a complex multimodal challenge that
requires integrating visual features with specialized clinical knowledge. While
vision-language pretraining (VLP) has advanced medical AI, its effectiveness in
dermatology is limited by text length constraints and the lack of structured
texts. In this paper, we introduce MAKE, a Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced
vision-language pretraining framework for zero-shot dermatological tasks.
Recognizing that comprehensive dermatological descriptions require multiple
knowledge aspects that exceed standard text constraints, our framework
introduces: (1) a multi-aspect contrastive learning strategy that decomposes
clinical narratives into knowledge-enhanced sub-texts through large language
models, (2) a fine-grained alignment mechanism that connects subcaptions with
diagnostically relevant image features, and (3) a diagnosis-guided weighting
scheme that adaptively prioritizes different sub-captions based on clinical
significance prior. Through pretraining on 403,563 dermatological image-text
pairs collected from education resources, MAKE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art VLP models on eight datasets across zero-shot skin disease
classification, concept annotation, and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Our code
will be made publicly available at https: //github.com/SiyuanYan1/MAKE.

Motivation: 提供一种直观、灵活的方式通过自然语言生成人类运动，适用于虚拟现实、游戏等领域。

Method: 分类现代文本到运动生成方法，从架构（VAE、扩散、混合）和运动表示（离散、连续）两个角度。

Result: 总结了当前领域进展、关键挑战和局限性，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文为语言驱动运动合成的研究者和从业者提供了有价值的起点。

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation offers a powerful and intuitive way to create
human movements directly from natural language. By removing the need for
predefined motion inputs, it provides a flexible and accessible approach to
controlling animated characters. This makes it especially useful in areas like
virtual reality, gaming, human-computer interaction, and robotics. In this
review, we first revisit the traditional perspective on motion synthesis, where
models focused on predicting future poses from observed initial sequences,
often conditioned on action labels. We then provide a comprehensive and
structured survey of modern text-to-motion generation approaches, categorizing
them from two complementary perspectives: (i) architectural, dividing methods
into VAE-based, diffusion-based, and hybrid models; and (ii) motion
representation, distinguishing between discrete and continuous motion
generation strategies. In addition, we explore the most widely used datasets,
evaluation methods, and recent benchmarks that have shaped progress in this
area. With this survey, we aim to capture where the field currently stands,
bring attention to its key challenges and limitations, and highlight promising
directions for future exploration. We hope this work offers a valuable starting
point for researchers and practitioners working to push the boundaries of
language-driven human motion synthesis.

Result: 敏感性和特异性分别提升至90.3%和89.3%，AUC达到0.949。

Conclusion: 实时反馈和迭代优化对提升AI模型性能至关重要。

Abstract: Background: There are many challenges and opportunities in the clinical
deployment of AI tools in radiology. The current study describes a radiology
software platform called NeoMedSys that can enable efficient deployment and
refinements of AI models. We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of
running NeoMedSys for three months in real-world clinical settings and focused
on improvement performance of an in-house developed AI model (VIOLA-AI)
designed for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) detection.
  Methods: NeoMedSys integrates tools for deploying, testing, and optimizing AI
models with a web-based medical image viewer, annotation system, and
hospital-wide radiology information systems. A pragmatic investigation was
deployed using clinical cases of patients presenting to the largest Emergency
Department in Norway (site-1) with suspected traumatic brain injury (TBI) or
patients with suspected stroke (site-2). We assessed ICH classification
performance as VIOLA-AI encountered new data and underwent pre-planned model
retraining. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy,
and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
  Results: NeoMedSys facilitated iterative improvements in the AI model,
significantly enhancing its diagnostic accuracy. Automated bleed detection and
segmentation were reviewed in near real-time to facilitate re-training
VIOLA-AI. The iterative refinement process yielded a marked improvement in
classification sensitivity, rising to 90.3% (from 79.2%), and specificity that
reached 89.3% (from 80.7%). The bleed detection ROC analysis for the entire
sample demonstrated a high area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.949 (from 0.873).
Model refinement stages were associated with notable gains, highlighting the
value of real-time radiologist feedback.

TLDR: 提出了一种新的联邦语义分割框架FedSaaS，通过类原型和对抗机制解决类一致性表示问题，显著提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在处理异构问题（如域偏移）时忽视了语义空间中的细粒度类关系，导致类表示模糊。

Method: 引入类原型作为本地和全局类表示的准则，服务器端建模类原型监督客户端全局分支，客户端通过对抗机制协调全局和本地分支，同时使用多级对比损失确保一致性。

Result: 在多个驾驶场景分割数据集上的实验表明，FedSaaS优于现有方法，显著提高了平均分割精度。

Conclusion: FedSaaS有效解决了类一致性表示问题，为联邦语义分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated semantic segmentation enables pixel-level classification in images
through collaborative learning while maintaining data privacy. However,
existing research commonly overlooks the fine-grained class relationships
within the semantic space when addressing heterogeneous problems, particularly
domain shift. This oversight results in ambiguities between class
representation. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel federated
segmentation framework that strikes class consistency, termed FedSaaS.
Specifically, we introduce class exemplars as a criterion for both local- and
global-level class representations. On the server side, the uploaded class
exemplars are leveraged to model class prototypes, which supervise global
branch of clients, ensuring alignment with global-level representation. On the
client side, we incorporate an adversarial mechanism to harmonize contributions
of global and local branches, leading to consistent output. Moreover,
multilevel contrastive losses are employed on both sides to enforce consistency
between two-level representations in the same semantic space. Extensive
experiments on several driving scene segmentation datasets demonstrate that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving average
segmentation accuracy and effectively addressing the class-consistency
representation problem.

Result: 在KITTI和Waymo数据集上验证了方法的优越性能。

Conclusion: FreeDriveRF在无需位姿输入的情况下，实现了高质量动态驾驶场景重建。

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction for autonomous driving enables vehicles to
perceive and interpret complex scene changes more precisely. Dynamic Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have recently shown promising capability in scene
modeling. However, many existing methods rely heavily on accurate poses inputs
and multi-sensor data, leading to increased system complexity. To address this,
we propose FreeDriveRF, which reconstructs dynamic driving scenes using only
sequential RGB images without requiring poses inputs. We innovatively decouple
dynamic and static parts at the early sampling level using semantic
supervision, mitigating image blurring and artifacts. To overcome the
challenges posed by object motion and occlusion in monocular camera, we
introduce a warped ray-guided dynamic object rendering consistency loss,
utilizing optical flow to better constrain the dynamic modeling process.
Additionally, we incorporate estimated dynamic flow to constrain the pose
optimization process, improving the stability and accuracy of unbounded scene
reconstruction. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI and Waymo datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our method in dynamic scene modeling
for autonomous driving.

Result: 在多个数据集上实现SOTA性能，无需额外细化即可直接渲染。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、泛化能力强，适用于稀疏点云，为点云渲染提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current learning-based methods predict NeRF or 3D Gaussians from point clouds
to achieve photo-realistic rendering but still depend on categorical priors,
dense point clouds, or additional refinements. Hence, we introduce a novel
point cloud rendering method by predicting 2D Gaussians from point clouds. Our
method incorporates two identical modules with an entire-patch architecture
enabling the network to be generalized to multiple datasets. The module
normalizes and initializes the Gaussians utilizing the point cloud information
including normals, colors and distances. Then, splitting decoders are employed
to refine the initial Gaussians by duplicating them and predicting more
accurate results, making our methodology effectively accommodate sparse point
clouds as well. Once trained, our approach exhibits direct generalization to
point clouds across different categories. The predicted Gaussians are employed
directly for rendering without additional refinement on the rendered images,
retaining the benefits of 2D Gaussians. We conduct extensive experiments on
various datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and
generalization of our method, which achieves SOTA performance. The code is

Motivation: 现有FAS方法缺乏可解释性，且无专门为FAS设计的MLLM和数据集，FaceShield填补了这一空白。

Method: 采用欺骗感知视觉感知（SAVP）和提示引导的视觉标记掩码（PVTM）策略，提升模型泛化能力。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，FaceShield在粗/细粒度分类、推理和攻击定位任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: FaceShield为FAS任务提供了高效、可解释的解决方案，相关数据和代码将公开。

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for protecting facial recognition systems
from presentation attacks. Previous methods approached this task as a
classification problem, lacking interpretability and reasoning behind the
predicted results. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
shown strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and decision-making in
visual tasks. However, there is currently no universal and comprehensive MLLM
and dataset specifically designed for FAS task. To address this gap, we propose
FaceShield, a MLLM for FAS, along with the corresponding pre-training and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, FaceShield-pre10K and FaceShield-sft45K.
FaceShield is capable of determining the authenticity of faces, identifying
types of spoofing attacks, providing reasoning for its judgments, and detecting
attack areas. Specifically, we employ spoof-aware vision perception (SAVP) that
incorporates both the original image and auxiliary information based on prior
knowledge. We then use an prompt-guided vision token masking (PVTM) strategy to
random mask vision tokens, thereby improving the model's generalization
ability. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets,
demonstrating that FaceShield significantly outperforms previous deep learning
models and general MLLMs on four FAS tasks, i.e., coarse-grained
classification, fine-grained classification, reasoning, and attack
localization. Our instruction datasets, protocols, and codes will be released
soon.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视雷达点云帧间错位及动态信息利用不足，导致检测性能受限。

Method: 提出MoRAL框架，包含运动感知雷达编码器（MRE）补偿错位，以及运动注意力门控融合（MAGF）模块利用动态信息引导LiDAR特征。

Result: 在VoD数据集上表现优异，整体区域mAP达73.30%，驾驶走廊达88.68%，行人检测AP为69.67%，骑行者达96.25%。

Conclusion: MoRAL通过运动感知融合显著提升检测性能，尤其在动态目标检测上表现突出。

Abstract: Reliable autonomous driving systems require accurate detection of traffic
participants. To this end, multi-modal fusion has emerged as an effective
strategy. In particular, 4D radar and LiDAR fusion methods based on multi-frame
radar point clouds have demonstrated the effectiveness in bridging the point
density gap. However, they often neglect radar point clouds' inter-frame
misalignment caused by object movement during accumulation and do not fully
exploit the object dynamic information from 4D radar. In this paper, we propose
MoRAL, a motion-aware multi-frame 4D radar and LiDAR fusion framework for
robust 3D object detection. First, a Motion-aware Radar Encoder (MRE) is
designed to compensate for inter-frame radar misalignment from moving objects.
Later, a Motion Attention Gated Fusion (MAGF) module integrate radar motion
features to guide LiDAR features to focus on dynamic foreground objects.
Extensive evaluations on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset demonstrate that MoRAL
outperforms existing methods, achieving the highest mAP of 73.30% in the entire
area and 88.68% in the driving corridor. Notably, our method also achieves the
best AP of 69.67% for pedestrians in the entire area and 96.25% for cyclists in
the driving corridor.

Motivation: LiDAR点云中的反射率数据在下游任务中至关重要，但在神经压缩方法中尚未充分探索。

Method: SerLiC将3D点云通过扫描顺序序列化为1D序列，结合传感器扫描索引、径向距离和先验反射率进行上下文表示，并采用Mamba模型进行高效序列建模。

Result: SerLiC实现了2倍以上的体积压缩，比现有方法减少22%的压缩比特，且仅需2%的参数；轻量版达到>10 fps，仅111K参数。

Conclusion: SerLiC在LiDAR反射率压缩中表现出色，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Reflectance attributes in LiDAR point clouds provide essential information
for downstream tasks but remain underexplored in neural compression methods. To
address this, we introduce SerLiC, a serialization-based neural compression
framework to fully exploit the intrinsic characteristics of LiDAR reflectance.
SerLiC first transforms 3D LiDAR point clouds into 1D sequences via scan-order
serialization, offering a device-centric perspective for reflectance analysis.
Each point is then tokenized into a contextual representation comprising its
sensor scanning index, radial distance, and prior reflectance, for effective
dependencies exploration. For efficient sequential modeling, Mamba is
incorporated with a dual parallelization scheme, enabling simultaneous
autoregressive dependency capture and fast processing. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SerLiC attains over 2x volume reduction against the original
reflectance data, outperforming the state-of-the-art method by up to 22%
reduction of compressed bits while using only 2% of its parameters. Moreover, a
lightweight version of SerLiC achieves > 10 fps (frames per second) with just
111K parameters, which is attractive for real-world applications.

Abstract: Pre-training on image-text colonoscopy records offers substantial potential
for improving endoscopic image analysis, but faces challenges including
non-informative background images, complex medical terminology, and ambiguous
multi-lesion descriptions. We introduce Endo-CLIP, a novel self-supervised
framework that enhances Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) for this

unification--addresses these challenges by (1) removing background frames, (2)
leveraging large language models to extract clinical attributes for
fine-grained contrastive learning, and (3) employing patient-level
cross-attention to resolve multi-polyp ambiguities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Endo-CLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
pre-training methods in zero-shot and few-shot polyp detection and
classification, paving the way for more accurate and clinically relevant
endoscopic analysis.

Motivation: 超声引导下细针穿刺活检中快速往复运动导致视觉特征暂时不可用，现有跟踪器无法有效应对。

Method: 提出MrTrack，采用Mamba-based register机制，包括全局上下文提取器和时序提示检索器，并引入自监督多样化损失防止特征崩溃。

Result: 在自动和手动穿刺数据集上，MrTrack在准确性、鲁棒性和推理效率上均优于现有跟踪器。

Conclusion: MrTrack通过时序上下文提取和检索，有效解决了快速往复运动导致的跟踪问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is a common minimally
invasive diagnostic procedure. However, an aspiration needle tracker addressing
rapid reciprocating motion is still missing. MrTrack, an aspiration needle
tracker with a mamba-based register mechanism, is proposed. MrTrack leverages a
Mamba-based register extractor to sequentially distill global context from each
historical search map, storing these temporal cues in a register bank. The
Mamba-based register retriever then retrieves temporal prompts from the
register bank to provide external cues when current vision features are
temporarily unusable due to rapid reciprocating motion and imaging degradation.
A self-supervised register diversify loss is proposed to encourage feature
diversity and dimension independence within the learned register, mitigating
feature collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on both motorized and
manual aspiration datasets demonstrate that MrTrack not only outperforms
state-of-the-art trackers in accuracy and robustness but also achieves superior
inference efficiency.

Conclusion: 通过结合游戏级推理和序列去噪，该方法有效弥补了现有像素级方法的不足，提升了足球事件检测的可靠性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) methods show
promising results for extracting soccer events from broadcast videos. However,
when operated in the high-recall, low-precision regime required for exhaustive
event coverage in soccer analytics, their lack of contextual understanding
becomes apparent: many false positives could be resolved by considering a
broader sequence of actions and game-state information. In this work, we
address this limitation by reasoning at the game level and improving STAD
through the addition of a denoising sequence transduction task. Sequences of
noisy, context-free player-centric predictions are processed alongside clean
game state information using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model. By
modeling extended temporal context and reasoning jointly over team-level
dynamics, our method leverages the "language of soccer" - its tactical
regularities and inter-player dependencies - to generate "denoised" sequences
of actions. This approach improves both precision and recall in low-confidence
regimes, enabling more reliable event extraction from broadcast video and
complementing existing pixel-based methods.

Motivation: 现有位置编码方法（如绝对或相对位置编码）主要关注1D线性位置关系，忽视了图像块间的语义相似性，限制了模型的泛化能力和翻译等变性。

Method: 提出SaPE²，通过动态适应局部内容而非固定线性关系或空间坐标，增强位置表示的语义感知能力。

Conclusion: SaPE²弥补了位置编码与感知相似性之间的差距，显著提升了视觉任务性能。

Abstract: Vision transformers have demonstrated significant advantages in computer
vision tasks due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and
contextual relationships through self-attention. However, existing position
encoding techniques, which are largely borrowed from natural language
processing, fail to effectively capture semantic-aware positional relationships
between image patches. Traditional approaches like absolute position encoding
and relative position encoding primarily focus on 1D linear position
relationship, often neglecting the semantic similarity between distant yet
contextually related patches. These limitations hinder model generalization,
translation equivariance, and the ability to effectively handle repetitive or
structured patterns in images. In this paper, we propose 2-Dimensional
Semantic-Aware Position Encoding ($\text{SaPE}^2$), a novel position encoding
method with semantic awareness that dynamically adapts position representations
by leveraging local content instead of fixed linear position relationship or
spatial coordinates. Our method enhances the model's ability to generalize
across varying image resolutions and scales, improves translation equivariance,
and better aggregates features for visually similar but spatially distant
patches. By integrating $\text{SaPE}^2$ into vision transformers, we bridge the
gap between position encoding and perceptual similarity, thereby improving
performance on computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is essential for the security of facial recognition
systems in diverse scenarios such as payment processing and surveillance.
Current multimodal FAS methods often struggle with effective generalization,
mainly due to modality-specific biases and domain shifts. To address these
challenges, we introduce the \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{m}odal \textbf{D}enoising
and \textbf{A}lignment (\textbf{MMDA}) framework. By leveraging the zero-shot
generalization capability of CLIP, the MMDA framework effectively suppresses
noise in multimodal data through denoising and alignment mechanisms, thereby
significantly enhancing the generalization performance of cross-modal
alignment. The \textbf{M}odality-\textbf{D}omain Joint \textbf{D}ifferential
\textbf{A}ttention (\textbf{MD2A}) module in MMDA concurrently mitigates the
impacts of domain and modality noise by refining the attention mechanism based
on extracted common noise features. Furthermore, the \textbf{R}epresentation
\textbf{S}pace \textbf{S}oft (\textbf{RS2}) Alignment strategy utilizes the
pre-trained CLIP model to align multi-domain multimodal data into a generalized
representation space in a flexible manner, preserving intricate representations
and enhancing the model's adaptability to various unseen conditions. We also

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种结合共形预测和近似后验采样的方法，用于在不知道真实图像的情况下，为全参考图像质量（FRIQ）指标提供统计保证的边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在成像逆问题中，评估恢复图像与真实图像的接近程度对安全关键应用（如医学成像）至关重要，但计算FRIQ指标因缺乏真实图像而困难。

Method: 结合共形预测和近似后验采样，构建具有用户指定错误概率保证的FRIQ边界。

Result: 在图像去噪和加速磁共振成像（MRI）问题上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为FRIQ指标提供了统计保证，有助于避免潜在的高成本误诊。

Abstract: In imaging inverse problems, we would like to know how close the recovered
image is to the true image in terms of full-reference image quality (FRIQ)
metrics like PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, etc. This is especially important in
safety-critical applications like medical imaging, where knowing that, say, the
SSIM was poor could potentially avoid a costly misdiagnosis. But since we don't
know the true image, computing FRIQ is non-trivial. In this work, we combine
conformal prediction with approximate posterior sampling to construct bounds on
FRIQ that are guaranteed to hold up to a user-specified error probability. We
demonstrate our approach on image denoising and accelerated magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) problems. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索事件相机在生理信号监测中的潜力，尤其是无接触心率检测。

Method: 使用监督式CNN模型从事件流中提取心率信号，评估模型性能。

Result: 事件相机在高帧率（60和120 FPS）下表现优于传统相机（30 FPS），RMSE最低为2.13 bpm。

Conclusion: 事件相机在远程心率监测中具有潜力，尤其是在高动态范围和高帧率场景下。

Abstract: Time event cameras are a novel technology for recording scene information at
extremely low latency and with low power consumption. Event cameras output a
stream of events that encapsulate pixel-level light intensity changes within
the scene, capturing information with a higher dynamic range and temporal
resolution than traditional cameras. This study investigates the contact-free
reconstruction of an individual's cardiac pulse signal from time event
recording of their face using a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN)
model. An end-to-end model is trained to extract the cardiac signal from a
two-dimensional representation of the event stream, with model performance
evaluated based on the accuracy of the calculated heart rate. The experimental
results confirm that physiological cardiac information in the facial region is
effectively preserved within the event stream, showcasing the potential of this
novel sensor for remote heart rate monitoring. The model trained on event
frames achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.32 beats per minute (bpm)
compared to the RMSE of 2.92 bpm achieved by the baseline model trained on
standard camera frames. Furthermore, models trained on event frames generated
at 60 and 120 FPS outperformed the 30 FPS standard camera results, achieving an
RMSE of 2.54 and 2.13 bpm, respectively.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles need a complete map of their surroundings to plan and
act. This has sparked research into the tasks of 3D occupancy prediction, 3D
scene completion, and 3D panoptic scene completion, which predict a dense map
of the ego vehicle's surroundings as a voxel grid. Scene completion extends
occupancy prediction by predicting occluded regions of the voxel grid, and
panoptic scene completion further extends this task by also distinguishing
object instances within the same class; both aspects are crucial for path
planning and decision-making. However, 3D panoptic scene completion is
currently underexplored. This work introduces a novel framework for 3D panoptic
scene completion that extends existing 3D semantic scene completion models. We
propose an Object Module and Panoptic Module that can easily be integrated with
3D occupancy and scene completion methods presented in the literature. Our
approach leverages the available annotations in occupancy benchmarks, allowing
individual object shapes to be learned as a differentiable problem. The code is
available at https://github.com/nicolamarinello/OffsetOcc .

Abstract: Cardiac image segmentation is an important step in many cardiac image
analysis and modeling tasks such as motion tracking or simulations of cardiac
mechanics. While deep learning has greatly advanced segmentation in clinical
settings, there is limited work on pre-clinical imaging, notably in porcine
models, which are often used due to their anatomical and physiological
similarity to humans. However, differences between species create a domain
shift that complicates direct model transfer from human to pig data.
  Recently, foundation models trained on large human datasets have shown
promise for robust medical image segmentation; yet their applicability to
porcine data remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can generate sufficiently accurate pseudo-labels for pig
cardiac CT and propose a simple self-training approach to iteratively refine
these labels. Our method requires no manually annotated pig data, relying
instead on iterative updates to improve segmentation quality. We demonstrate
that this self-training process not only enhances segmentation accuracy but
also smooths out temporal inconsistencies across consecutive frames. Although
our results are encouraging, there remains room for improvement, for example by
incorporating more sophisticated self-training strategies and by exploring
additional foundation models and other cardiac imaging technologies.

Abstract: Unifying image understanding and generation has gained growing attention in
recent research on multimodal models. Although design choices for image
understanding have been extensively studied, the optimal model architecture and
training recipe for a unified framework with image generation remain
underexplored. Motivated by the strong potential of autoregressive and
diffusion models for high-quality generation and scalability, we conduct a
comprehensive study of their use in unified multimodal settings, with emphasis
on image representations, modeling objectives, and training strategies.
Grounded in these investigations, we introduce a novel approach that employs a
diffusion transformer to generate semantically rich CLIP image features, in
contrast to conventional VAE-based representations. This design yields both
higher training efficiency and improved generative quality. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that a sequential pretraining strategy for unified models-first
training on image understanding and subsequently on image generation-offers
practical advantages by preserving image understanding capability while
developing strong image generation ability. Finally, we carefully curate a
high-quality instruction-tuning dataset BLIP3o-60k for image generation by
prompting GPT-4o with a diverse set of captions covering various scenes,
objects, human gestures, and more. Building on our innovative model design,
training recipe, and datasets, we develop BLIP3-o, a suite of state-of-the-art
unified multimodal models. BLIP3-o achieves superior performance across most of
the popular benchmarks spanning both image understanding and generation tasks.
To facilitate future research, we fully open-source our models, including code,
model weights, training scripts, and pretraining and instruction tuning
datasets.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成领域虽取得进展，但真实图像编辑仍面临计算量大或重建效果差的问题。

Method: SAGE基于DDIM算法，利用扩散U-Net的自注意力层设计新引导机制，通过注意力图计算重建目标，高效保留未编辑区域。

Result: SAGE在定量和定性评估中优于其他方法，用户研究中47名用户全部偏好SAGE，且在10项定量分析中7项排名第一。

Conclusion: SAGE通过自注意力引导机制有效解决了图像编辑中的关键挑战，成为当前最优方法。

Abstract: The field of text-to-image generation has undergone significant advancements
with the introduction of diffusion models. Nevertheless, the challenge of
editing real images persists, as most methods are either computationally
intensive or produce poor reconstructions. This paper introduces SAGE
(Self-Attention Guidance for image Editing) - a novel technique leveraging
pre-trained diffusion models for image editing. SAGE builds upon the DDIM
algorithm and incorporates a novel guidance mechanism utilizing the
self-attention layers of the diffusion U-Net. This mechanism computes a
reconstruction objective based on attention maps generated during the inverse
DDIM process, enabling efficient reconstruction of unedited regions without the
need to precisely reconstruct the entire input image. Thus, SAGE directly
addresses the key challenges in image editing. The superiority of SAGE over
other methods is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations
and confirmed by a statistically validated comprehensive user study, in which
all 47 surveyed users preferred SAGE over competing methods. Additionally, SAGE
ranks as the top-performing method in seven out of 10 quantitative analyses and
secures second and third places in the remaining three.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于变分学习的VQA方法（IVON），显著提升了多模态模型的校准性和可靠性，尤其在分布偏移情况下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态模型在VQA任务中取得进展，但其在分布外（OOD）场景下的校准性和可靠性问题仍未解决。

Method: 采用变分算法IVON替代AdamW进行微调，生成模型参数的后验分布。

Result: 实验显示，该方法将预期校准误差降低50%以上，覆盖率提升4%（固定风险1%），在OOD情况下覆盖率提升8%。

Conclusion: 变分学习是提升多模态模型可靠性的有效方法。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in multimodal models for Visual Question
Answering (VQA), there remain major reliability concerns because the models can
often be overconfident and miscalibrated, especially in out-of-distribution
(OOD) settings. Plenty has been done to address such issues for unimodal
models, but little work exists for multimodal cases. Here, we address
unreliability in multimodal models by proposing a Variational VQA approach.
Specifically, instead of fine-tuning vision-language models by using AdamW, we
employ a recently proposed variational algorithm called IVON, which yields a
posterior distribution over model parameters. Through extensive experiments, we
show that our approach improves calibration and abstentions without sacrificing
the accuracy of AdamW. For instance, compared to AdamW fine-tuning, we reduce
Expected Calibration Error by more than 50% compared to the AdamW baseline and
raise Coverage by 4% vs. SOTA (for a fixed risk of 1%). In the presence of
distribution shifts, the performance gain is even higher, achieving 8% Coverage
(@ 1% risk) improvement vs. SOTA when 50% of test cases are OOD. Overall, we
present variational learning as a viable option to enhance the reliability of
multimodal models.

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式控制光照强度和颜色，实现了高质量的光照编辑。

Abstract: We present a simple, yet effective diffusion-based method for fine-grained,
parametric control over light sources in an image. Existing relighting methods
either rely on multiple input views to perform inverse rendering at inference
time, or fail to provide explicit control over light changes. Our method
fine-tunes a diffusion model on a small set of real raw photograph pairs,
supplemented by synthetically rendered images at scale, to elicit its
photorealistic prior for relighting. We leverage the linearity of light to
synthesize image pairs depicting controlled light changes of either a target
light source or ambient illumination. Using this data and an appropriate
fine-tuning scheme, we train a model for precise illumination changes with
explicit control over light intensity and color. Lastly, we show how our method
can achieve compelling light editing results, and outperforms existing methods
based on user preference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AVVP任务需要定位单模态和多模态事件，但全监督标注成本高昂，弱监督方法在生成伪标签时缺乏段间依赖性和存在预测偏差，限制了性能。

Method: 提出UWAV方法，通过不确定性加权伪标签和特征混合正则化，优化模型训练。

Result: UWAV在多个指标和数据集上优于现有方法，证明了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: UWAV通过改进伪标签生成和训练正则化，显著提升了弱监督AVVP任务的性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) entails the challenging task of localizing
both uni-modal events (i.e., those occurring exclusively in either the visual
or acoustic modality of a video) and multi-modal events (i.e., those occurring
in both modalities concurrently). Moreover, the prohibitive cost of annotating
training data with the class labels of all these events, along with their start
and end times, imposes constraints on the scalability of AVVP techniques unless
they can be trained in a weakly-supervised setting, where only
modality-agnostic, video-level labels are available in the training data. To
this end, recently proposed approaches seek to generate segment-level
pseudo-labels to better guide model training. However, the absence of
inter-segment dependencies when generating these pseudo-labels and the general
bias towards predicting labels that are absent in a segment limit their
performance. This work proposes a novel approach towards overcoming these
weaknesses called Uncertainty-weighted Weakly-supervised Audio-visual Video
Parsing (UWAV). Additionally, our innovative approach factors in the
uncertainty associated with these estimated pseudo-labels and incorporates a
feature mixup based training regularization for improved training. Empirical
results show that UWAV outperforms state-of-the-art methods for the AVVP task
on multiple metrics, across two different datasets, attesting to its
effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了森林地面物体分割的挑战，为无人机在森林监测中的应用提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for reforestation and
forest monitoring, including seed dispersal in hard-to-reach terrains. However,
a detailed understanding of the forest floor remains a challenge due to high
natural variability, quickly changing environmental parameters, and ambiguous
annotations due to unclear definitions. To address this issue, we adapt the
Segment Anything Model (SAM), a vision foundation model with strong
generalization capabilities, to segment forest floor objects such as tree
stumps, vegetation, and woody debris. To this end, we employ
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to fine-tune a small subset of
additional model parameters while keeping the original weights fixed. We adjust
SAM's mask decoder to generate masks corresponding to our dataset categories,
allowing for automatic segmentation without manual prompting. Our results show
that the adapter-based PEFT method achieves the highest mean intersection over
union (mIoU), while Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA), with fewer parameters, offers a
lightweight alternative for resource-constrained UAV platforms.

Conclusion: 视频引导规划方法有效，能处理顺序依赖任务，并推广到视频未覆盖的场景。

Abstract: This work aims to leverage instructional video to solve complex multi-step
task-and-motion planning tasks in robotics. Towards this goal, we propose an
extension of the well-established Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner,
which simultaneously grows multiple trees around grasp and release states
extracted from the guiding video. Our key novelty lies in combining contact
states and 3D object poses extracted from the guiding video with a traditional
planning algorithm that allows us to solve tasks with sequential dependencies,
for example, if an object needs to be placed at a specific location to be
grasped later. We also investigate the generalization capabilities of our
approach to go beyond the scene depicted in the instructional video. To
demonstrate the benefits of the proposed video-guided planning approach, we
design a new benchmark with three challenging tasks: (I) 3D re-arrangement of
multiple objects between a table and a shelf, (ii) multi-step transfer of an
object through a tunnel, and (iii) transferring objects using a tray similar to
a waiter transfers dishes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our planning
algorithm on several robots, including the Franka Emika Panda and the KUKA KMR
iiwa. For a seamless transfer of the obtained plans to the real robot, we
develop a trajectory refinement approach formulated as an optimal control
problem (OCP).

Result: 实验表明，RT-cache比无检索的基线更快、更成功地完成任务。

Conclusion: RT-cache为实时机器人操作提供了一种实用的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces RT-cache, a novel trajectorymemory pipeline that
accelerates real-world robot inference by leveraging big-data retrieval and
learning from experience. While modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can
handle diverse robotic tasks, they often incur high per-step inference costs,
resulting in significant latency, sometimes minutes per task. In contrast,
RT-cache stores a large-scale Memory of previously successful robot
trajectories and retrieves relevant multistep motion snippets, drastically
reducing inference overhead. By integrating a Memory Builder with a Trajectory
Retrieval, we develop an efficient retrieval process that remains tractable
even for extremely large datasets. RT-cache flexibly accumulates real-world
experiences and replays them whenever the current scene matches past states,
adapting quickly to new or unseen environments with only a few additional
samples. Experiments on the Open-X Embodiment Dataset and other real-world data
demonstrate that RT-cache completes tasks both faster and more successfully
than a baseline lacking retrieval, suggesting a practical, data-driven solution
for real-time manipulation.

Abstract: Due to the deformability of garments, generating a large amount of

In this paper, we present a synthetic garment dataset that can be used for
robotic garment folding. We begin by constructing geometric garment templates
based on keypoints and applying generative models to generate realistic texture
patterns. Leveraging these keypoint annotations, we generate folding
demonstrations in simulation and train folding policies via closed-loop
imitation learning. To improve robustness, we propose KG-DAgger, which uses a
keypoint-based strategy to generate demonstration data for recovering from
failures. KG-DAgger significantly improves the model performance, boosting the
real-world success rate by 25\%. After training with 15K trajectories (about 2M

TLDR: 论文提出APR-Transformer模型，利用图像或LiDAR数据预测绝对位姿，在GNSS缺失环境中表现优异，并在多个数据集上验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确初始化对定位算法性能至关重要，尤其在GNSS缺失环境中，传统方法表现不佳。

Method: 提出APR-Transformer模型，基于深度神经网络预测3D位置和方向。

Result: 在Radar Oxford Robot-Car、DeepLoc和自定义数据集APR-BeIntelli上达到最优性能，并在实际自动驾驶车辆中验证了可靠性。

Conclusion: APR-Transformer在GNSS缺失环境中具有实用性和高效性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Precise initialization plays a critical role in the performance of
localization algorithms, especially in the context of robotics, autonomous
driving, and computer vision. Poor localization accuracy is often a consequence
of inaccurate initial poses, particularly noticeable in GNSS-denied
environments where GPS signals are primarily relied upon for initialization.
Recent advances in leveraging deep neural networks for pose regression have led
to significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness, especially in
estimating complex spatial relationships and orientations. In this paper, we
introduce APR-Transformer, a model architecture inspired by state-of-the-art
methods, which predicts absolute pose (3D position and 3D orientation) using
either image or LiDAR data. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on established benchmark datasets such as the
Radar Oxford Robot-Car and DeepLoc datasets. Furthermore, we extend our
experiments to include our custom complex APR-BeIntelli dataset. Additionally,
we validate the reliability of our approach in GNSS-denied environments by
deploying the model in real-time on an autonomous test vehicle. This showcases
the practical feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. The source code is

### [89] [In-Context Learning for Label-Efficient Cancer Image Classification in Oncology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08798)
*Mobina Shrestha,Bishwas Mandal,Vishal Mandal,Asis Shrestha*

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: 论文研究了在肿瘤学中应用上下文学习（ICL）作为模型重新训练的替代方案，通过少量标注样本使模型适应新任务，无需重新训练。测试了四种视觉语言模型（VLMs）在三个肿瘤数据集上的表现，结果显示ICL在资源有限的环境中具有潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI在肿瘤学中依赖大量标注数据和需要重新训练的问题，探索ICL作为更实用的替代方案。

Method: 使用四种VLMs（Paligemma、CLIP、ALIGN、GPT-4o）在三个肿瘤数据集（MHIST、PatchCamelyon、HAM10000）上评估ICL性能。

Result: 所有模型在少量样本提示下表现显著提升，GPT-4o在二元和多类分类中分别达到F1分数0.81和0.60。开源模型表现接近，适合资源有限的环境。

Conclusion: ICL在肿瘤学中具有实用潜力，尤其适用于罕见癌症和资源受限的场景，无需大量标注数据或重新训练。

Abstract: The application of AI in oncology has been limited by its reliance on large,
annotated datasets and the need for retraining models for domain-specific
diagnostic tasks. Taking heed of these limitations, we investigated in-context
learning as a pragmatic alternative to model retraining by allowing models to
adapt to new diagnostic tasks using only a few labeled examples at inference,
without the need for retraining. Using four vision-language models
(VLMs)-Paligemma, CLIP, ALIGN and GPT-4o, we evaluated the performance across
three oncology datasets: MHIST, PatchCamelyon and HAM10000. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to compare the performance of multiple VLMs
on different oncology classification tasks. Without any parameter updates, all
models showed significant gains with few-shot prompting, with GPT-4o reaching
an F1 score of 0.81 in binary classification and 0.60 in multi-class
classification settings. While these results remain below the ceiling of fully
fine-tuned systems, they highlight the potential of ICL to approximate
task-specific behavior using only a handful of examples, reflecting how
clinicians often reason from prior cases. Notably, open-source models like
Paligemma and CLIP demonstrated competitive gains despite their smaller size,
suggesting feasibility for deployment in computing constrained clinical
environments. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of ICL as a
practical solution in oncology, particularly for rare cancers and
resource-limited contexts where fine-tuning is infeasible and annotated data is
difficult to obtain.

TLDR: 提出了一种统一的多器官和多语言超声报告生成框架，通过片段化多语言训练和标准化报告结构，显著提升了生成报告的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声报告生成因图像变异性、操作依赖性和缺乏标准化数据集而具有挑战性，本研究旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 整合片段化多语言训练，构建双语数据集，并通过选择性解冻视觉变换器（ViT）优化文本-图像对齐。

Result: 相比KMVE方法，BLEU提升2%，ROUGE-L提升3%，CIDEr提升15%，显著减少错误内容。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在临床工作流中统一多器官和多语言报告生成的潜力。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) report generation is a challenging task due to the
variability of US images, operator dependence, and the need for standardized
text. Unlike X-ray and CT, US imaging lacks consistent datasets, making
automation difficult. In this study, we propose a unified framework for
multi-organ and multilingual US report generation, integrating fragment-based
multilingual training and leveraging the standardized nature of US reports. By
aligning modular text fragments with diverse imaging data and curating a
bilingual English-Chinese dataset, the method achieves consistent and
clinically accurate text generation across organ sites and languages.
Fine-tuning with selective unfreezing of the vision transformer (ViT) further
improves text-image alignment. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art KMVE
method, our approach achieves relative gains of about 2\% in BLEU scores,
approximately 3\% in ROUGE-L, and about 15\% in CIDEr, while significantly
reducing errors such as missing or incorrect content. By unifying multi-organ
and multi-language report generation into a single, scalable framework, this
work demonstrates strong potential for real-world clinical workflows.

Conclusion: 该方法在显微镜图像处理中具有广泛适用性，代码已开源便于集成使用。

Abstract: Experimentally acquired microscopy images are unavoidably affected by the
presence of noise and other unwanted signals, which degrade their quality and
might hide relevant features. With the recent increase in image acquisition
rate, modern denoising and restoration solutions become necessary. This study
focuses on image decomposition and denoising of microscopy images through a
workflow based on total variation (TV), addressing images obtained from various
microscopy techniques, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our
approach consists in restoring an image by extracting its unwanted signal
components and subtracting them from the raw one, or by denoising it. We
evaluate the performance of TV-$L^1$, Huber-ROF, and TGV-$L^1$ in achieving
this goal in distinct study cases. Huber-ROF proved to be the most flexible
one, while TGV-$L^1$ is the most suitable for denoising. Our results suggest a
wider applicability of this method in microscopy, restricted not only to STM,
AFM, and SEM images. The Python code used for this study is publicly available
as part of AiSurf. It is designed to be integrated into experimental workflows
for image acquisition or can be used to denoise previously acquired images.

Conclusion: 共形预测需进一步优化以生成更符合人类预期的预测集，提升其在临床实践中的实用性。

Abstract: Deep learning based cervical cancer classification can potentially increase
access to screening in low-resource regions. However, deep learning models are
often overconfident and do not reliably reflect diagnostic uncertainty.
Moreover, they are typically optimized to generate maximum-likelihood
predictions, which fail to convey uncertainty or ambiguity in their results.
Such challenges can be addressed using conformal prediction, a model-agnostic
framework for generating prediction sets that contain likely classes for
trained deep-learning models. The size of these prediction sets indicates model
uncertainty, contracting as model confidence increases. However, existing
conformal prediction evaluation primarily focuses on whether the prediction set
includes or covers the true class, often overlooking the presence of extraneous
classes. We argue that prediction sets should be truthful and valuable to end
users, ensuring that the listed likely classes align with human expectations
rather than being overly relaxed and including false positives or unlikely
classes. In this study, we comprehensively validate conformal prediction sets
using expert annotation sets collected from multiple annotators. We evaluate
three conformal prediction approaches applied to three deep-learning models
trained for cervical atypia classification. Our expert annotation-based
analysis reveals that conventional coverage-based evaluations overestimate
performance and that current conformal prediction methods often produce
prediction sets that are not well aligned with human labels. Additionally, we
explore the capabilities of the conformal prediction methods in identifying
ambiguous and out-of-distribution data.

TLDR: BiECVC是一种双向视频压缩框架，通过多样化上下文建模和自适应门控机制，显著提升了性能，首次超越VTM 13.2 RA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双向视频压缩方法在上下文提取和动态抑制方面表现不足，导致性能落后于单向方法。

Method: 结合局部和非局部上下文建模，采用线性注意力机制和双向上下文门控动态过滤信息。

Result: BiECVC在RA配置下比特率降低13.4%和15.7%，首次全面超越VTM 13.2。

Conclusion: BiECVC通过创新设计实现了双向视频压缩的突破，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent forward prediction-based learned video compression (LVC) methods have
achieved impressive results, even surpassing VVC reference software VTM under
the Low Delay B (LDB) configuration. In contrast, learned bidirectional video
compression (BVC) remains underexplored and still lags behind its forward-only
counterparts. This performance gap is mainly due to the limited ability to
extract diverse and accurate contexts: most existing BVCs primarily exploit
temporal motion while neglecting non-local correlations across frames.
Moreover, they lack the adaptability to dynamically suppress harmful contexts
arising from fast motion or occlusion. To tackle these challenges, we propose
BiECVC, a BVC framework that incorporates diversified local and non-local
context modeling along with adaptive context gating. For local context
enhancement, BiECVC reuses high-quality features from lower layers and aligns
them using decoded motion vectors without introducing extra motion overhead.To
model non-local dependencies efficiently, we adopt a linear attention mechanism
that balances performance and complexity. To further mitigate the impact of
inaccurate context prediction, we introduce Bidirectional Context Gating,
inspired by data-dependent decay in recent autoregressive language models, to
dynamically filter contextual information based on conditional coding results.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiECVC achieves state-of-the-art
performance, reducing the bit-rate by 13.4% and 15.7% compared to VTM 13.2
under the Random Access (RA) configuration with intra periods of 32 and 64,
respectively. To our knowledge, BiECVC is the first learned video codec to
surpass VTM 13.2 RA across all standard test datasets. Code will be available
at https://github.com/JiangWeibeta/ECVC.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在灵活q空间采样下合成DWI时的局限性，同时利用多模态数据提升合成质量。

Method: 采用协作注意力机制动态调整内部表示，结合任务特定约束保持解剖保真度。

Result: 在HCP数据集上表现优于现有方法，定量和定性评估均更优，且能保留细节。

Conclusion: Q-CATN是一种有潜力的工具，适用于临床和研究，支持灵活q空间采样。

Abstract: This study, we propose a novel Q-space Guided Collaborative Attention
Translation Networks (Q-CATN) for multi-shell, high-angular resolution DWI
(MS-HARDI) synthesis from flexible q-space sampling, leveraging the commonly
acquired structural MRI data. Q-CATN employs a collaborative attention
mechanism to effectively extract complementary information from multiple
modalities and dynamically adjust its internal representations based on
flexible q-space information, eliminating the need for fixed sampling schemes.
Additionally, we introduce a range of task-specific constraints to preserve
anatomical fidelity in DWI, enabling Q-CATN to accurately learn the intrinsic
relationships between directional DWI signal distributions and q-space.
Extensive experiments on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate
that Q-CATN outperforms existing methods, including 1D-qDL, 2D-qDL, MESC-SD,
and QGAN, in estimating parameter maps and fiber tracts both quantitatively and
qualitatively, while preserving fine-grained details. Notably, its ability to
accommodate flexible q-space sampling highlights its potential as a promising
toolkit for clinical and research applications. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗领域AI工具的推广提供了可行方案，兼顾性能与透明度。

Abstract: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, where early
detection and accurate diagnosis are critical for improving survival rates.
While deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has
revolutionized medical image analysis by detecting subtle patterns indicative
of early-stage lung cancer, its adoption faces challenges. These models are
often computationally expensive and require significant resources, making them
unsuitable for resource constrained environments. Additionally, their lack of
transparency hinders trust and broader adoption in sensitive fields like
healthcare. Knowledge distillation addresses these challenges by transferring
knowledge from large, complex models (teachers) to smaller, lightweight models
(students). We propose a knowledge distillation-based approach for lung cancer
detection, incorporating explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance model
transparency. Eight CNNs, including ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3,
and VGG16, are evaluated as teacher models. We developed and trained a
lightweight student model, Distilled Custom Student Network (DCSNet) using
ResNet50 as the teacher. This approach not only ensures high diagnostic
performance in resource-constrained settings but also addresses transparency
concerns, facilitating the adoption of AI-driven diagnostic tools in
healthcare.

Motivation: 高分辨率fMRI成本高且难以普及，而EEG广泛可用，但现有EEG-to-fMRI生成器在性能或效率上存在不足。

Method: 采用多方向时间-频率卷积注意力编码器和Vision-Mamba U-Net解码器，结合SSI-MSE损失函数进行端到端训练。

Result: 在三个公开基准测试中取得最佳SSIM和PSNR分数，分别提升14.5%、14.9%、16.9%和4.6%。

Conclusion: Spec2VolCAMU-Net轻量高效，适用于临床和研究的实时应用。

Abstract: High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for
mapping human brain activity; however, it remains costly and logistically
challenging. If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely
available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would
become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on
plain CNNs that fail to capture cross-channel time-frequency cues or on heavy
transformer/GAN decoders that strain memory and stability. We propose
Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight spectrogram-to-volume generator that confronts
these issues via a Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention
Encoder, stacking temporal, spectral and joint convolutions with
self-attention, and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder whose linear-time state-space
blocks enable efficient long-range spatial modelling. Trained end-to-end with a
hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on
three public benchmarks, recording SSIMs of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball
and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9%
respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves
competitive PSNR scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a
4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in
reconstruction quality. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making
it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings. The

Result: 在模拟和临床MRI脑数据上验证了方法的有效性，重建质量优于现有方法，重建时间减少50%。

Conclusion: 该方法在运动伪影严重的MRI重建中表现出色，具有显著的性能提升和效率优势。

Abstract: High-resolution slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) from multiple
motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D slices constitutes a critical step in
image-based diagnostics of moving subjects, such as fetal brain Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing solutions struggle with image artifacts and
severe subject motion or require slice pre-alignment to achieve satisfying
reconstruction performance. We propose a novel SVR method to enable fast and
accurate MRI reconstruction even in cases of severe image and motion
corruption. Our approach performs motion correction, outlier handling, and
super-resolution reconstruction with all operations being entirely based on
implicit neural representations. The model can be initialized with
task-specific priors through fully self-supervised meta-learning on either
simulated or real-world data. In extensive experiments including over 480
reconstructions of simulated and clinical MRI brain data from different
centers, we prove the utility of our method in cases of severe subject motion
and image artifacts. Our results demonstrate improvements in reconstruction
quality, especially in the presence of severe motion, compared to
state-of-the-art methods, and up to 50% reduction in reconstruction time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究常将LLMs与人类专家比较，但“专家”定义模糊且LLM更新迅速，可能威胁患者安全。

Method: 提出需开发策略，使LLMs与人类在临床环境中高效协作，而非直接比较。

Result: 强调人机协作的重要性，而非竞争。

Conclusion: 未来研究应聚焦于LLMs在临床中的安全使用策略，实现人机共生。

Abstract: Currently, a considerable research effort is devoted to comparing LLMs to a
group of human experts, where the term "expert" is often ill-defined or
variable, at best, in a state of constantly updating LLM releases. Without
proper safeguards in place, LLMs will threaten to cause harm to the established
structure of safe delivery of patient care which has been carefully developed
throughout history to keep the safety of the patient at the forefront. A key
driver of LLM innovation is founded on community research efforts which, if
continuing to operate under "humans versus LLMs" principles, will expedite this
trend. Therefore, research efforts moving forward must focus on effectively
characterizing the safe use of LLMs in clinical settings that persist across
the rapid development of novel LLM models. In this communication, we
demonstrate that rather than comparing LLMs to humans, there is a need to
develop strategies enabling efficient work of humans with LLMs in an almost
symbiotic manner.

explainability of the system and makes it accessible to non-experts. It also
reduces hallucination risk. Since it requires less supervision than traditional
classification systems, it can more easily be applied to other problems or

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have advanced image editing with high-quality
results and intuitive interfaces such as prompts and semantic drawing. However,
these interfaces lack precise control, and the associated methods typically
specialize on a single editing task. We introduce a versatile, generative
workflow that operates in an intrinsic-image latent space, enabling semantic,
local manipulation with pixel precision for a range of editing operations.
Building atop the RGB-X diffusion framework, we address key challenges of
identity preservation and intrinsic-channel entanglement. By incorporating
exact diffusion inversion and disentangled channel manipulation, we enable
precise, efficient editing with automatic resolution of global illumination
effects -- all without additional data collection or model fine-tuning. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks on complex
images, including color and texture adjustments, object insertion and removal,
global relighting, and their combinations.

Abstract: High-quality 3D reconstruction of pulmonary segments plays a crucial role in
segmentectomy and surgical treatment planning for lung cancer. Due to the
resolution requirement of the target reconstruction, conventional deep
learning-based methods often suffer from computational resource constraints or
limited granularity. Conversely, implicit modeling is favored due to its
computational efficiency and continuous representation at any resolution. We
propose a neural implicit function-based method to learn a 3D surface to
achieve anatomy-aware, precise pulmonary segment reconstruction, represented as
a shape by deforming a learnable template. Additionally, we introduce two
clinically relevant evaluation metrics to assess the reconstruction
comprehensively. Further, due to the absence of publicly available shape
datasets to benchmark reconstruction algorithms, we developed a shape dataset
named Lung3D, including the 3D models of 800 labeled pulmonary segments and the
corresponding airways, arteries, veins, and intersegmental veins. We
demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, providing
a new perspective for pulmonary segment reconstruction. Code and data will be

TLDR: 提出了一种基于重参数化的神经BRDF重要性采样方法，提高了渲染效率和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经BRDF在物理渲染中提升真实感，但其重要性采样仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过重参数化将分布学习任务转化为BRDF积分替换问题，避免依赖可逆网络和多步推理。

Result: 在神经BRDF渲染中实现了最佳的方差减少，同时保持高推理速度。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经BRDF重要性采样提供了更高效和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) have emerged
as popular material representations for enhancing realism in physically-based
rendering. Yet their importance sampling remains a significant challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a reparameterization-based formulation of neural BRDF
importance sampling that seamlessly integrates into the standard rendering
pipeline with precise generation of BRDF samples. The reparameterization-based
formulation transfers the distribution learning task to a problem of
identifying BRDF integral substitutions. In contrast to previous methods that
rely on invertible networks and multi-step inference to reconstruct BRDF
distributions, our model removes these constraints, which offers greater
flexibility and efficiency. Our variance and performance analysis demonstrates
that our reparameterization method achieves the best variance reduction in
neural BRDF renderings while maintaining high inference speeds compared to
existing baselines.

TLDR: UMotion是一个基于不确定性驱动的框架，结合IMU和UWB传感器，通过UKF实时优化3D人体姿态和形状估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏可穿戴IMU在3D人体运动估计中存在姿态模糊、数据漂移和适应性不足的问题。

Method: 提出UMotion框架，结合IMU和UWB传感器，利用UKF实时融合传感器数据与人体运动约束。

Result: 实验表明UMotion能稳定传感器数据，并在姿态精度上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: UMotion通过多传感器融合和实时优化，有效解决了姿态估计中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Sparse wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) have gained popularity for
estimating 3D human motion. However, challenges such as pose ambiguity, data
drift, and limited adaptability to diverse bodies persist. To address these
issues, we propose UMotion, an uncertainty-driven, online fusing-all state
estimation framework for 3D human shape and pose estimation, supported by six
integrated, body-worn ultra-wideband (UWB) distance sensors with IMUs. UWB
sensors measure inter-node distances to infer spatial relationships, aiding in
resolving pose ambiguities and body shape variations when combined with
anthropometric data. Unfortunately, IMUs are prone to drift, and UWB sensors
are affected by body occlusions. Consequently, we develop a tightly coupled
Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework that fuses uncertainties from sensor
data and estimated human motion based on individual body shape. The UKF
iteratively refines IMU and UWB measurements by aligning them with uncertain
human motion constraints in real-time, producing optimal estimates for each.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of UMotion in stabilizing sensor data and the improvement over
state of the art in pose accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源AI库存在未被充分研究的风险（如安全、许可等），需要系统化评估工具。

Method: 基于LangGraph构建的图框架，协调多个专业代理从可信源提取、验证和量化风险。

Result: 应用于20个常用库，覆盖88%的OpenSSF检查，发现每库最多19个额外风险（如RCE漏洞、SBOM缺失等）。

Conclusion: LibVulnWatch为AI供应链风险提供了可扩展、透明的评估机制，推动技术治理。

Abstract: Open-source AI libraries are foundational to modern AI systems but pose
significant, underexamined risks across security, licensing, maintenance,
supply chain integrity, and regulatory compliance. We present LibVulnWatch, a
graph-based agentic assessment framework that performs deep, source-grounded
evaluations of these libraries. Built on LangGraph, the system coordinates a
directed acyclic graph of specialized agents to extract, verify, and quantify
risk using evidence from trusted sources such as repositories, documentation,
and vulnerability databases. LibVulnWatch generates reproducible,
governance-aligned scores across five critical domains, publishing them to a
public leaderboard for longitudinal ecosystem monitoring. Applied to 20 widely
used libraries, including ML frameworks, LLM inference engines, and agent
orchestration tools, our system covers up to 88% of OpenSSF Scorecard checks
while uncovering up to 19 additional risks per library. These include critical
Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, absent Software Bills of Materials
(SBOMs), licensing constraints, undocumented telemetry, and widespread gaps in
regulatory documentation and auditability. By translating high-level governance
principles into practical, verifiable metrics, LibVulnWatch advances technical
AI governance with a scalable, transparent mechanism for continuous supply
chain risk assessment and informed library selection.

Motivation: 无人商店的自动结账系统存在对抗性补丁攻击的安全漏洞，可能导致严重问题，因此需要研究其影响和防御方法。

Method: 研究了三种对抗性补丁攻击（隐藏、创建和修改攻击），并引入新的颜色直方图相似性损失函数和边界框评估指标。在数字和物理环境中测试攻击效果，并评估黑盒场景下的攻击鲁棒性。

Result: 对抗性补丁攻击能有效干扰目标检测模型，阴影攻击在黑盒场景下也能提高成功率。现有防御机制在实时检测中存在不足。

Conclusion: 研究强调了加强无人商店防御策略的必要性，并提供了改进目标检测模型鲁棒性和防御措施的见解。

Abstract: The advent of convenient and efficient fully unmanned stores equipped with
artificial intelligence-based automated checkout systems marks a new era in
retail. However, these systems have inherent artificial intelligence security
vulnerabilities, which are exploited via adversarial patch attacks,
particularly in physical environments. This study demonstrated that adversarial
patches can severely disrupt object detection models used in unmanned stores,
leading to issues such as theft, inventory discrepancies, and interference. We
investigated three types of adversarial patch attacks -- Hiding, Creating, and
Altering attacks -- and highlighted their effectiveness. We also introduce the
novel color histogram similarity loss function by leveraging attacker knowledge
of the color information of a target class object. Besides the traditional
confusion-matrix-based attack success rate, we introduce a new
bounding-boxes-based metric to analyze the practical impact of these attacks.
Starting with attacks on object detection models trained on snack and fruit
datasets in a digital environment, we evaluated the effectiveness of
adversarial patches in a physical testbed that mimicked a real unmanned store
with RGB cameras and realistic conditions. Furthermore, we assessed the
robustness of these attacks in black-box scenarios, demonstrating that shadow
attacks can enhance success rates of attacks even without direct access to
model parameters. Our study underscores the necessity for robust defense
strategies to protect unmanned stores from adversarial threats. Highlighting
the limitations of the current defense mechanisms in real-time detection
systems and discussing various proactive measures, we provide insights into
improving the robustness of object detection models and fortifying unmanned
retail environments against these attacks.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习（RL）的动态安全策略管理框架，用于解决云环境中静态策略的不足，显著提升了入侵检测率和响应速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云环境（如AWS）的安全需求复杂且动态变化，静态安全策略已无法应对威胁的演化和资源的弹性需求。

Method: 采用深度强化学习算法（如深度Q网络和近端策略优化），利用云遥测数据动态调整防火墙规则和IAM策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，该框架的入侵检测率（92%）显著高于静态策略（82%），且响应时间减少了58%。

Conclusion: 验证了基于强化学习的自适应方法在提升云安全策略管理中的有效性。

Abstract: The security of cloud environments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), is
complex and dynamic. Static security policies have become inadequate as threats
evolve and cloud resources exhibit elasticity [1]. This paper addresses the
limitations of static policies by proposing a security policy management
framework that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt dynamically.
Specifically, we employ deep reinforcement learning algorithms, including deep
Q Networks and proximal policy optimization, enabling the learning and
continuous adjustment of controls such as firewall rules and Identity and
Access Management (IAM) policies. The proposed RL based solution leverages
cloud telemetry data (AWS Cloud Trail logs, network traffic data, threat
intelligence feeds) to continuously refine security policies, maximizing threat
mitigation, and compliance while minimizing resource impact. Experimental
results demonstrate that our adaptive RL based framework significantly
outperforms static policies, achieving higher intrusion detection rates (92%
compared to 82% for static policies) and substantially reducing incident
detection and response times by 58%. In addition, it maintains high conformity
with security requirements and efficient resource usage. These findings
validate the effectiveness of adaptive reinforcement learning approaches in
improving cloud security policy management.

TLDR: 提出了一种自动化构建基于事实的合成数据模型评估方法，利用语言模型自动评估领域知识，效果接近人工评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工构建评估基准耗时且难以覆盖所有领域，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 利用语言模型和基础文档自动生成合成数据问题，评估模型性能。

Result: 合成数据评估与人工评估相关性高（Spearman 0.96，Pearson 0.79），发现Gemma3模型表现优异。

Conclusion: 自动化评估方法高效且可靠，适用于大规模模型评估。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) continue to advance, improving response quality and
coherence. Given Internet-scale training datasets, LMs have likely encountered
much of what users might ask them to generate in some form during their
training. A plethora of evaluation benchmarks have been constructed to assess
model quality, response appropriateness, and reasoning capabilities. However,
the human effort required for benchmark construction is limited and being
rapidly outpaced by the size and scope of the models under evaluation.
Additionally, having humans build a benchmark for every possible domain of
interest is impractical. Therefore, we propose a methodology for automating the
construction of fact-based synthetic data model evaluations grounded in
document populations. This work leverages those very same LMs to evaluate
domain-specific knowledge automatically, using only grounding documents (e.g.,
a textbook) as input. This synthetic data benchmarking approach corresponds
well with human curated questions with a Spearman ranking correlation of 0.96
and a benchmark evaluation Pearson accuracy correlation of 0.79. This novel
tool supports generating both multiple choice and open-ended synthetic data
questions to gain diagnostic insight of LM capability. We apply this
methodology to evaluate model performance on a recent relevant arXiv preprint,
discovering a surprisingly strong performance from Gemma3 models.

Abstract: We introduce a method of meta-prompting that jointly produces fluent text for
complex tasks while optimizing the similarity of neural states between a
human's mental expectation and a Large Language Model's (LLM) neural
processing. A technique of agentic reinforcement learning is applied, in which
an LLM as a Judge (LLMaaJ) teaches another LLM, through in-context learning,
how to produce content by interpreting the intended and unintended generated
text traits. To measure human mental beliefs around content production, users
modify long form AI-generated text articles before publication at the US Open
2024 tennis Grand Slam. Now, an LLMaaJ can solve the Theory of Mind (ToM)
alignment problem by anticipating and including human edits within the creation
of text from an LLM. Throughout experimentation and by interpreting the results
of a live production system, the expectations of human content reviewers had
100% of alignment with AI 53.8% of the time with an average iteration count of
4.38. The geometric interpretation of content traits such as factualness,
novelty, repetitiveness, and relevancy over a Hilbert vector space combines
spatial volume (all trait importance) with vertices alignment (individual trait
relevance) enabled the LLMaaJ to optimize on Human ToM. This resulted in an
increase in content quality by extending the coverage of tennis action. Our
work that was deployed at the US Open 2024 has been used across other live
events within sports and entertainment.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在复杂开放任务中生成自信但错误或无关信息（幻觉）的问题，提升其多步推理能力。

Method: 结合CoT与RAG，引入自我一致性和自我验证策略，利用外部知识源进行推理并验证输出。

Result: 比较了基线LLMs与CoT、CoT+RAG、自我一致性和自我验证方法的效果，发现结合方法能显著减少幻觉并保持流畅性和推理深度。

Conclusion: 综合CoT、RAG、自我一致性和自我验证的策略是减少幻觉并提升LLMs事实准确性的最有效方法。

Abstract: Hallucination, where large language models (LLMs) generate confident but
incorrect or irrelevant information, remains a key limitation in their
application to complex, open-ended tasks. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has
emerged as a promising method for improving multistep reasoning by guiding
models through intermediate steps. However, CoT alone does not fully address
the hallucination problem. In this work, we investigate how combining CoT with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), as well as applying self-consistency and
self-verification strategies, can reduce hallucinations and improve factual
accuracy. By incorporating external knowledge sources during reasoning and
enabling models to verify or revise their own outputs, we aim to generate more
accurate and coherent responses. We present a comparative evaluation of
baseline LLMs against CoT, CoT+RAG, self-consistency, and self-verification
techniques. Our results highlight the effectiveness of each method and identify
the most robust approach for minimizing hallucinations while preserving fluency
and reasoning depth.

Method: 使用发展心理学中的'Blicket Test'范式，评估LM推断因果关系的能力，并分析其偏见。

Result: LM在处理合取关系时表现较差，且这种偏见与人类成年人类似。提出的采样方法显著减少了偏见。

Conclusion: LM的因果推理能力存在系统性偏见，但通过测试时采样方法可以改善其科学性和严谨性。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents are increasingly used as autonomous
decision-makers who need to actively gather information to guide their
decisions. A crucial cognitive skill for such agents is the efficient
exploration and understanding of the causal structure of the world -- key to
robust, scientifically grounded reasoning. Yet, it remains unclear whether LMs
possess this capability or exhibit systematic biases leading to erroneous
conclusions. In this work, we examine LMs' ability to explore and infer causal
relationships, using the well-established "Blicket Test" paradigm from
developmental psychology. We find that LMs reliably infer the common, intuitive
disjunctive causal relationships but systematically struggle with the unusual,
yet equally (or sometimes even more) evidenced conjunctive ones. This
"disjunctive bias" persists across model families, sizes, and prompting
strategies, and performance further declines as task complexity increases.
Interestingly, an analogous bias appears in human adults, suggesting that LMs
may have inherited deep-seated reasoning heuristics from their training data.
To this end, we quantify similarities between LMs and humans, finding that LMs
exhibit adult-like inference profiles (but not children-like). Finally, we
propose a test-time sampling method which explicitly samples and eliminates
hypotheses about causal relationships from the LM. This scalable approach
significantly reduces the disjunctive bias and moves LMs closer to the goal of
scientific, causally rigorous reasoning.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于可变形周期网络的GAN（DPN-GAN），通过引入周期性激活函数和可变形卷积，提升了音频生成的质量和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GAN模型在音频生成中依赖带宽受限的mel频谱图，导致分辨率受限和模式崩溃问题。

Method: 设计了DPN-GAN，包含周期性ReLU激活函数和可变形卷积模块，支持多分辨率生成，并改进了判别器网络。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，DPN-GAN在性能和鲁棒性上优于现有GAN模型。

Conclusion: DPN-GAN通过创新架构显著提升了音频生成的质量和适应性。

Abstract: In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made significant
progress in generating audio sequences. However, these models typically rely on
bandwidth-limited mel-spectrograms, which constrain the resolution of generated
audio sequences, and lead to mode collapse during conditional generation. To
address this issue, we propose Deformable Periodic Network based GAN (DPN-GAN),
a novel GAN architecture that incorporates a kernel-based periodic ReLU
activation function to induce periodic bias in audio generation. This
innovative approach enhances the model's ability to capture and reproduce
intricate audio patterns. In particular, our proposed model features a DPN
module for multi-resolution generation utilizing deformable convolution
operations, allowing for adaptive receptive fields that improve the quality and
fidelity of the synthetic audio. Additionally, we enhance the discriminator
network using deformable convolution to better distinguish between real and
generated samples, further refining the audio quality. We trained two versions
of the model: DPN-GAN small (38.67M parameters) and DPN-GAN large (124M
parameters). For evaluation, we use five different datasets, covering both
speech synthesis and music generation tasks, to demonstrate the efficiency of
the DPN-GAN. The experimental results demonstrate that DPN-GAN delivers
superior performance on both out-of-distribution and noisy data, showcasing its
robustness and adaptability. Trained across various datasets, DPN-GAN
outperforms state-of-the-art GAN architectures on standard evaluation metrics,
and exhibits increased robustness in synthesized audio.

Motivation: 解决机器学习模型和交互系统在结构化与非结构化数据之间缺乏整合的问题，提升知识访问和利用效率。

Result: 在STaRK基准测试的三个测试集上均优于现有方法，平均首次命中率比次优方法高25.7%。

Conclusion: FocusedRetriever展示了SKB在多跳问答中的潜力，未来可通过微调LLM进一步提升性能。

Abstract: In many real-world settings, machine learning models and interactive systems
have access to both structured knowledge, e.g., knowledge graphs or tables, and
unstructured content, e.g., natural language documents. However, most rely on
either. Semi-Structured Knowledge Bases (SKBs) bridge this gap by linking
unstructured content to nodes within structured data, thereby enabling new
strategies for knowledge access and use. In this work, we present
FocusedRetriever, a modular SKB-based framework for multi-hop question
answering. It integrates components (VSS-based entity search, LLM-based
generation of Cypher queries and pairwise re-ranking) in a way that enables it
to outperform state-of-the-art methods across all three STaRK benchmark test
sets, covering diverse domains and multiple performance metrics. The average
first-hit rate exceeds that of the second-best method by 25.7%.
FocusedRetriever leverages (1) the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
extract relational facts and entity attributes from unstructured text, (2) node
set joins to filter answer candidates based on these extracted triplets and
constraints, (3) vector similarity search to retrieve and rank relevant
unstructured content, and (4) the contextual capabilities of LLMs to finally
rank the top-k answers. For generality, we only incorporate base LLMs in
FocusedRetriever in our evaluation. However, our analysis of intermediate
results highlights several opportunities for further upgrades including
finetuning. The source code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子机器学习力场（MLFFs）通常忽略电子密度（ED）的重要性，而ED对准确理解分子力场至关重要。然而，ED的计算依赖耗时的第一性原理密度泛函理论（DFT），导致缺乏大规模ED数据。

Method: 基于PCQM4Mv2构建了EDBench数据集，包含330万分子的准确ED数据，并设计了一套以ED为中心的基准任务（预测、检索和生成）。

Result: 评估表明，基于EDBench的学习方法不仅可行，还能高效计算ED，精度与传统DFT相当，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: EDBench为电子密度驱动的药物发现和材料科学奠定了坚实基础，所有数据和基准将免费提供。

Abstract: Existing molecular machine learning force fields (MLFFs) generally focus on
the learning of atoms, molecules, and simple quantum chemical properties (such
as energy and force), but ignore the importance of electron density (ED)
$\rho(r)$ in accurately understanding molecular force fields (MFFs). ED
describes the probability of finding electrons at specific locations around
atoms or molecules, which uniquely determines all ground state properties (such
as energy, molecular structure, etc.) of interactive multi-particle systems
according to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, the calculation of ED relies
on the time-consuming first-principles density functional theory (DFT) which
leads to the lack of large-scale ED data and limits its application in MLFFs.
In this paper, we introduce EDBench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ED
designed to advance learning-based research at the electronic scale. Built upon
the PCQM4Mv2, EDBench provides accurate ED data, covering 3.3 million
molecules. To comprehensively evaluate the ability of models to understand and
utilize electronic information, we design a suite of ED-centric benchmark tasks
spanning prediction, retrieval, and generation. Our evaluation on several
state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that learning from EDBench is not only
feasible but also achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we show that learning-based
method can efficiently calculate ED with comparable precision while
significantly reducing the computational cost relative to traditional DFT
calculations. All data and benchmarks from EDBench will be freely available,
laying a robust foundation for ED-driven drug discovery and materials science.

Motivation: 探索离散数据（如层次结构）是否可以通过几何方式完美表示，并揭示其与广义相对论和场论的潜在联系。

Method: 使用局部层次信号（定向标记对）构建模型，通过因果结构而非距离来编码层次关系，并在WordNet语料库中测试。

Result: 成功实现了对WordNet中哺乳动物子树的完美嵌入，并扩展到82,115个名词标记的最大无歧义子集。结果表明离散数据存在三维几何表示。

Conclusion: 层次结构及其关系本质上是几何的，且与广义相对论和场论有深刻联系。

Abstract: We show that there is a fast algorithm that embeds hierarchical structures in
three-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The correlation of data ends up purely
encoded in the causal structure. Our model relies solely on oriented token
pairs -- local hierarchical signals -- with no access to global symbolic
structure. We apply our method to the corpus of \textit{WordNet}. We provide a
perfect embedding of the mammal sub-tree including ambiguities (more than one
hierarchy per node) in such a way that the hierarchical structures get
completely codified in the geometry and exactly reproduce the ground-truth. We
extend this to a perfect embedding of the maximal unambiguous subset of the
\textit{WordNet} with 82{,}115 noun tokens and a single hierarchy per token. We
introduce a novel retrieval mechanism in which causality, not distance, governs
hierarchical access. Our results seem to indicate that all discrete data has a
perfect geometrical representation that is three-dimensional. The resulting
embeddings are nearly conformally invariant, indicating deep connections with
general relativity and field theory. These results suggest that concepts,
categories, and their interrelations, namely hierarchical meaning itself, is
geometric.

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的归一化，三元量化LLM可显著缩小与全精度模型的精度差距，使超低比特推理实用化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural-language processing,
yet their scale makes real-world deployment costly. Post-training quantization
reduces memory and computation but often degrades accuracy, while
quantization-aware training can recover performance at the cost of extra
training. Pushing quantization to the ternary (2-bit) regime yields even larger
savings but is notoriously unstable. Building on recent work showing that a
bias-free, RMS-normalized Transformer with straight-through estimation can
reach 1.58-bit precision, we demonstrate that simply inserting RMS
normalization before every linear projection and applying a gradual, layer-wise
quantization schedule stably fine-tunes full-precision checkpoints into ternary
LLMs. Our approach matches or surpasses more elaborate knowledge-distillation
pipelines on standard language-modeling benchmarks without adding model
complexity. These results indicate that careful normalization alone can close
much of the accuracy gap between ternary and full-precision LLMs, making
ultra-low-bit inference practical.

Abstract: Predicting the future citation rates of academic papers is an important step
toward the automation of research evaluation and the acceleration of scientific
progress. We present $\textbf{ForeCite}$, a simple but powerful framework to
append pre-trained causal language models with a linear head for average
monthly citation rate prediction. Adapting transformers for regression tasks,
ForeCite achieves a test correlation of $\rho = 0.826$ on a curated dataset of
900K+ biomedical papers published between 2000 and 2024, a 27-point improvement
over the previous state-of-the-art. Comprehensive scaling-law analysis reveals
consistent gains across model sizes and data volumes, while temporal holdout
experiments confirm practical robustness. Gradient-based saliency heatmaps
suggest a potentially undue reliance on titles and abstract texts. These
results establish a new state-of-the-art in forecasting the long-term influence
of academic research and lay the groundwork for the automated, high-fidelity
evaluation of scientific contributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估大型语言模型（LLM）在复杂客户体验管理环境中的实用性时存在不足，缺乏真实性和深度知识库集成。

Method: 开发了一个可扩展的LLM驱动管道，模拟品牌CXM实体，并通过噪声注入和自动化验证生成数据集。

Conclusion: CXMArena为评估AI在CXM中的实用性提供了更真实的基准，揭示了当前模型在复杂任务中的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense potential for revolutionizing
Customer Experience Management (CXM), particularly in contact center
operations. However, evaluating their practical utility in complex operational
environments is hindered by data scarcity (due to privacy concerns) and the
limitations of current benchmarks. Existing benchmarks often lack realism,
failing to incorporate deep knowledge base (KB) integration, real-world noise,
or critical operational tasks beyond conversational fluency. To bridge this
gap, we introduce CXMArena, a novel, large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset
specifically designed for evaluating AI in operational CXM contexts. Given the
diversity in possible contact center features, we have developed a scalable
LLM-powered pipeline that simulates the brand's CXM entities that form the
foundation of our datasets-such as knowledge articles including product
specifications, issue taxonomies, and contact center conversations. The
entities closely represent real-world distribution because of controlled noise
injection (informed by domain experts) and rigorous automated validation.
Building on this, we release CXMArena, which provides dedicated benchmarks
targeting five important operational tasks: Knowledge Base Refinement, Intent
Prediction, Agent Quality Adherence, Article Search, and Multi-turn RAG with
Integrated Tools. Our baseline experiments underscore the benchmark's
difficulty: even state of the art embedding and generation models achieve only
68% accuracy on article search, while standard embedding methods yield a low F1
score of 0.3 for knowledge base refinement, highlighting significant challenges
for current models necessitating complex pipelines and solutions over
conventional techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for prioritizing urban green space
development in Tehran using diverse socio-economic, environmental, and
sensitivity indices. The indices were derived from various sources including
Google Earth Engine, air pollution measurements, municipal reports and the
Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model. The WRF model was used to estimate
the air temperature at a 1 km resolution due to insufficient meteorological
stations, yielding RMSE and MAE values of 0.96{\deg}C and 0.92{\deg}C,
respectively. After data preparation, several machine learning models were used
for binary vegetation cover classification including XGBoost, LightGBM, Random
Forest (RF) and Extra Trees. RF achieved the highest performance, exceeding 94%
in Overall Accuracy, Recall, and F1-score. Then, the probability of areas
lacking vegetation cover was assessed using socio-economic, environmental and
sensitivity indices. This resulted in the RF generating an urban green space
development prioritization map. Feature Importance Analysis revealed that the
most significant indices were nightly land surface temperature (LST) and
sensitive population. Finally, the framework performance was validated through
microclimate simulation to assess the critical areas after and before the green
space development by green roofs. The simulation demonstrated reducing air
temperature by up to 0.67{\deg}C after utilizing the green roof technology in
critical areas. As a result, this framework provides a valuable tool for urban
planners to develop green spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: GreenFactory是一种基于零成本代理的集成方法，通过随机森林回归器预测模型测试准确率，解决了传统代理方法泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经架构搜索中评估网络性能需要训练和评估，耗时耗资源；现有零成本代理方法泛化能力差且仅提供相对排名。

Method: 提出GreenFactory，集成多个零成本代理，利用随机森林回归器直接预测模型测试准确率。

Result: 在NATS-Bench上表现优异，Kendall相关系数高（如CIFAR-10为0.907），验证了其可靠性。

Conclusion: GreenFactory在多种数据集和搜索空间中表现稳健，显著提升了性能预测的准确性。

Abstract: Determining the performance of a Deep Neural Network during Neural
Architecture Search processes is essential for identifying optimal
architectures and hyperparameters. Traditionally, this process requires
training and evaluation of each network, which is time-consuming and
resource-intensive. Zero-cost proxies estimate performance without training,
serving as an alternative to traditional training. However, recent proxies
often lack generalization across diverse scenarios and provide only relative
rankings rather than predicted accuracies. To address these limitations, we
propose GreenFactory, an ensemble of zero-cost proxies that leverages a random
forest regressor to combine multiple predictors' strengths and directly predict
model test accuracy. We evaluate GreenFactory on NATS-Bench, achieving robust
results across multiple datasets. Specifically, GreenFactory achieves high
Kendall correlations on NATS-Bench-SSS, indicating substantial agreement
between its predicted scores and actual performance: 0.907 for CIFAR-10, 0.945
for CIFAR-100, and 0.920 for ImageNet-16-120. Similarly, on NATS-Bench-TSS, we
achieve correlations of 0.921 for CIFAR-10, 0.929 for CIFAR-100, and 0.908 for
ImageNet-16-120, showcasing its reliability in both search spaces.

*Andrew C. Freeman*

Main category: cs.MM

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于Media Over QUIC Transport协议的实时内容审核方法，适用于一对多视频直播流，能够仅删除违规内容片段，同时支持透明化任务分发到客户端设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着直播流媒体的普及，实时内容审核的需求日益增长，但直播的高延迟要求对审核技术提出了挑战。

Method: 扩展了Media Over QUIC Transport协议，实现实时内容审核，支持仅删除违规片段并透明化分发分析任务。

Result: 在光敏性观众的光闪烁移除实验中，系统仅增加了一个GOP（图像组）持续时间的延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了直播内容审核的实时性问题，同时保持了低延迟和高效率。

Abstract: Live video streaming is increasingly popular on social media platforms. With
the growth of live streaming comes an increased need for robust content
moderation to remove dangerous, illegal, or otherwise objectionable content.
Whereas video on demand distribution enables offline content analysis, live
streaming imposes restrictions on latency for both analysis and distribution.
In this paper, we present extensions to the in-progress Media Over QUIC
Transport protocol that enable real-time content moderation in one-to-many
video live streams. Importantly, our solution removes only the video segments
that contain objectionable content, allowing playback resumption as soon as the
stream conforms to content policies again. Content analysis tasks may be
transparently distributed to arbitrary client devices. We implement and
evaluate our system in the context of light strobe removal for photosensitive
viewers, finding that streaming clients experience an increased latency of only
one group-of-pictures duration.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in hardware design has taken off in
recent years, principally through its incorporation in tools that increase chip
designer productivity. There has been considerable discussion about the use of
LLMs in RTL specifications of chip designs, for which the two most popular
languages are Verilog and VHDL. LLMs and their use in Verilog design has
received significant attention due to the higher popularity of the language,
but little attention so far has been given to VHDL despite its continued
popularity in the industry. There has also been little discussion about the
unique needs of organizations that engage in high-performance processor design,
and techniques to deploy AI solutions in these settings. In this paper, we
describe our journey in developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically
for the purpose of explaining VHDL code, a task that has particular importance
in an organization with decades of experience and assets in high-performance
processor design. We show how we developed test sets specific to our needs and
used them for evaluating models as we performed extended pretraining (EPT) of a
base LLM. Expert evaluation of the code explanations produced by the EPT model
increased to 69% compared to a base model rating of 43%. We further show how we
developed an LLM-as-a-judge to gauge models similar to expert evaluators. This
led us to deriving and evaluating a host of new models, including an
instruction-tuned version of the EPT model with an expected expert evaluator
rating of 71%. Our experiments also indicate that with the potential use of
newer base models, this rating can be pushed to 85% and beyond. We conclude
with a discussion on further improving the quality of hardware design LLMs
using exciting new developments in the Generative AI world.
